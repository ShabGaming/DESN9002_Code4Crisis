We all agree a breakaway state is pointless, so I genuinely don’t understand why the option of the Armenians in the Armenian separatist territory (not including the territories where Azeris were ethnically cleansed in the 90s by Armenian soldiers) let them join as a part of Armenia with a Lachin corridor (owned by Azerbaijan, controlled by Turkey) connecting it to Armenia proper and a Zangezur corridor (owned by Armenia, controlled by a foreign power like France or Russia or America) connecting Nahkchivan to Azerbaijan proper… to me this seems like the most logical solution that would result in long term peace and least problems. It is clear to me that the Armenians currently in Nagorno-Karabakh are unwilling to be a part of Azerbaijan, so I don’t see why Azerbaijan would go through the trouble of trying to pacify them.  

Please explain why this is or is not an acceptable solution in the comments, any response appreciated. Thank you 🙏"

Is there anyone who could provide me with expert commentary willing to speak to me for a postgraduate multimedia journalism feature? I am specifically looking for research fellows, international law or diplomacy academics etc.

It would be for a recorded phone interview around 5-7 minutes and could possibly reach a larger audience through community channels like Central News and 2SER radio."

11/11/2020,Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement,"*This thread lists details about the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement and all questions about it should be asked in this comment section and not as a separate post.*  


On 9 November 2020, a ceasefire was signed between Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan brokered by Russian President Vladimir Putin officially ending the second Nagorno-Karabakh war.  


Details and the terms of the agreement:  


1. A complete ceasefire and end to all hostilities in the Karabakh conflict from 00:00 Moscow time on November 10 2020. The Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia, hereinafter referred to as the parties stop at the positions they occupy.
2. [Aghdam District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agdam_District) returns to the Republic of Azerbaijan by November 20 2020.
3. Along the contact line in Nagorno-Karabakh and along the [Lachin corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachin_corridor) there will be a peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation in the amount of 1960 military personnel with small arms, 90 armoured personnel carriers, 380 automotive units and special equipment.
4. The peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation is deployed in parallel with the withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces. The duration of the peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation is 5 years with automatic renewal for the next 5 year periods if none of the parties state otherwise 6 months in advance.
5. In order to improve the effectiveness of control over the implementation by the Parties to the conflict agreements, a peacekeeping centre is being deployed to control the ceasefire.
6. The Republic of Armenia will return to Azerbaijan the [Kalbajar District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalbajar_District) by November 15th 2020 and the [Lachin District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachin_District) by December 1st. The [Lachin corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachin_corridor) (5 km (3.1 mi) wide) which will provide communication to Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, without affecting the town of [Shusha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shusha) remains under the control of the peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation. By agreement of the Parties, a construction plan will be determined in the next three years for a new route of movement along the Lachin corridor, providing a link between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia with the subsequent redeployment of the Russian peacekeeping contingent to guard this route. The Republic of Azerbaijan guarantees the safety of traffic along the Lachin corridor of citizens, vehicles, and goods in both directions.
7. Internally displaced persons and refugees return to the territories of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent areas under the control of the [UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Office_of_the_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees).
8. The exchange of prisoners of war is to be made, hostages, and other detainees as well as the remains of casualties.
9. All economic and transport links in the region are to be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia guarantees the safety of transport links between western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to organise the unimpeded movement of citizens, vehicles and cargo in both directions. Transport control is carried out by the bodies of the Border Service of the FSB of Russia. By agreement of the Parties, the construction of new transport communications linking the [Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic) with regions of Azerbaijan is to take place.  


**TLDR:**   


* Armenian forces leave Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding districts completely. Parts of Nagorno-Karabakh captured by Azerbaijan during the war ([Shusha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shusha), [Hadrut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrut), [Azykh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azokh), [Suqovuşan (Madagiz)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagiz)) and other smaller towns/villages) will remain under full Azerbaijani control and administration.   

* Remaining parts of Nagorno-Karabakh ([Khankendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepanakert), [Khojavend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojavend_(town)), [Aghdara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martakert), [Khojaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojaly_(town))) will have Russian peacekeepers. The details about the administration of these places are not public yet, but it is known that it won't be Armenia or the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh.   

* Azerbaijan will get a road to Nakhchivan through Armenia. The road will be controlled by Russian peacekeepers.  

* There are rumours about Turkish peacekeepers, but it is not confirmed yet. Even if there are no Turkish peacekeepers, strong Turkish presence in the conflict and South Caucasus is expected.  

* Russia will stay in the remaining parts of Nagorno-Karabakh for 5 years. This period will be renewed for another 5 years if no side objects after the first 5 years.  

* All surrounding districts will be returned to Azerbaijan until 1 December.

 Global freedom faces a dire threat. Around the world, the enemies of liberal democracy—a form of self-government in which human rights are recognized and every individual is entitled to equal treatment under law—are accelerating their attacks. Authoritarian regimes have become more effective at co-opting or circumventing the norms and institutions meant to support basic liberties, and at providing aid to others who wish to do the same. In countries with long-established democracies, internal forces have exploited the shortcomings in their systems, distorting national politics to promote hatred, violence, and unbridled power. Those countries that have struggled in the space between democracy and authoritarianism, meanwhile, are increasingly tilting toward the latter. The global order is nearing a tipping point, and if democracy’s defenders do not work together to help guarantee freedom for all people, the authoritarian model will prevail. 

Freedom scores (higher=better):

- Armenia: 54/100

- **Nagorno-Karabakh: 37/100**

- Turkey: 32/100

- Russia: 12/100

- Azerbaijan: 9/100

As I understand it, this conflict is not very ""unique"". People from two nations have been living on a piece of land, and now they can't decide who it belongs to. However, unlike places like Israel and Kashmir, where similar conflicts happen, it seems to me (an outsider and layman) that the two peoples have quite a lot in common AND both countries could benefit from uniting. There isn't a huge power imbalance between the two, so it's not like one would leech off the other. By uniting, people could keep living where they live, fighting would stop, and they could be a stronger country overall. Of course the big neighbors would not like this, but they are already making too much money on this conflict.

Is this just daydreaming? What are the holes in this theory? If I am wrong on something, please don't be upset, but tell me about it. I never intended to pick a side or spread misinformation.

Edit: thanks for all the replies everybody! I suspected from the start that just asking the fighters to put down the weapons wouldn't work. After all, a war is what neither part wants, but it has led to this anyway. But reading all your replies and links to resources is really interesting, this is a part of the world I already knew little about."

9/24/2023,The one real solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,
9/15/2022,What are your thoughts on the Armenia–Azerbaijan border crisis?,"[Context](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict): The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is an ethnic and territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, inhabited mostly by ethnic Armenians,and seven surrounding districts, inhabited mostly by Azerbaijanis until their evacuation in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.

The conflict had and increased in attacks by Azerbaijan with Russia pulling out “peace keeping” forces out of Armenia. Armenia called for article 4 of CSTO but Russia said no. So what are your thoughts and who do you stand with?"
10/17/2023,Opinion | We Just Saw What the World Is About to Become,"> The history of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh was ended in the old manner of conflict resolution: siege, conquest, expulsion. After a 10-month blockade, Azerbaijan launched an attack on Sept. 19, claiming the enclave in a day and causing nearly the entire ethnic Armenian population to flee. Give war a chance, as the saying goes.

> For Armenians, a classic relic ethnic minority whose Christianity and peculiar alphabet date to the epic struggles between the Romans and the Parthians, it was another genocide. For the Azerbaijanis, Turkic in language and historically Shia Muslim, a great triumph. Yet despite appearances, the conflict is not a Samuel Huntington-style clash of civilizations. Instead, in its emboldening of traditional regional powers like Turkey, scrambling for geopolitical spoils after the retreat of superpowers, it’s a harbinger of the coming world disorder.

> Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region in the South Caucasus, is perennially contested. Ceded by Persia to Russia in the 19th century, it fell into dispute with the emergence of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan both claiming it. In 1921, Stalin attached the enclave to Azerbaijan, home to oil resources and a thriving intellectual culture. Yet the thin crust of Azeri modernist intelligentsia was eliminated in Stalin’s purges of the 1930s and replaced by corrupt functionaries overseen by the formidable K.G.B. general Heydar Aliyev. (His son, Ilham Aliyev, is the dynastic president of Azerbaijan.)

> In 1988, Mikhail Gorbachev’s dreams of achieving a more rational, humane Soviet Union emboldened Armenian intellectuals to start a tremendous popular movement for uniting the Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh with mainland Armenia. This seemed deceptively easy: transfer a province from one Soviet republic to another. But the Armenian demands ran into protests in Azerbaijan that almost immediately turned violent. Gorbachev looked impotent in the face of disasters he had provoked. From there to the end of the superpower, it took just three years.

> In the chaotic aftermath of Soviet collapse, the Armenians undertook to defend Nagorno-Karabakh by force. Instead of poetic intellectuals, the wartime generation of Armenian leaders became militia commanders. They proved earthier and, soon, brazenly corrupt. Defending the country became their sole means of legitimacy, ruling out the concessions that peace would require. By 1994 the Armenians, mobilizing around the traumatic memories of genocide, succeeded in expelling scores of Azeris from the enclave. Last month, Azerbaijan got more than even.

> In that project, it had a powerful backer: Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a master of vertiginous visions, has already tried Islamic liberalism, joining Europe, leading the Arab revolts, challenging Israel and negotiating peace in Ukraine. He now has another dream: opening a geopolitical corridor from Europe through Central Asia, all the way to China. This is the “Zangezur corridor,” a 25-mile-long strip of land to be carved through Armenia as part of a peace deal imposed at gunpoint.

> Iran is not happy with Azerbaijan’s victory. As openly as the Iranians ever do, they’ve threatened to use force against any changes to the borders of Armenia. Iran, a millenniums-old civilization central to a whole continent, cannot tolerate being walled off behind a chain of Turkish dependencies. India, similarly, is on Armenia’s side and has been sending a regular supply of weapons. One spur for such support, no doubt, is Pakistan’s joining the Azeri-Turkish alliance. In the jargon of American lawyers, this opens a whole new can of worms.

> Then there’s Russia, whose absence from the denouement in Nagorno-Karabakh was striking. Even after the 1990s, Moscow still remained by far the biggest supplier of weapons to both Armenia and Azerbaijan. Their economies and societies, above all the elites and their corruption networks, were until very recently molded together. What we are seeing now, as both nations slip out of Russia’s orbit, might be the second round of Soviet collapse.

> Once again, Armenia started the shift. In spring 2018 a tremendously hopeful uprising, reminiscent of 1989 in Central Europe, forced the post-communist elites to surrender power. Vladimir Putin was visibly displeased to meet Nikol Pashinyan, the anticorruption journalist and street rebel elected Armenia’s premier by an overwhelming majority. Mr. Pashinyan admittedly had neither political team nor experience; he is learning statesmanship on the job, often at great expense to his nation. Yet he managed to significantly reduce corruption, helping to unlock the legendary entrepreneurship of Armenians. Amid all the grim news, the Armenian economy, led by the I.T. sector, is registering impressive growth.

> All that, to Moscow, is punishable. When in September 2020 Azerbaijan launched a massive offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh lasting 44 terrible days, Russia effectively allowed Azerbaijan and Turkey to nearly destroy its Armenian ally, under the pretext that Karabakh was outside the mutual defense treaty. At the cusp of Azeri victory, however, Mr. Putin personally brokered a cease-fire and ordered a crack force of his peacekeepers into the enclave.

> That brought nearly all the perimeter of the former Soviet Union into Russia’s sphere of influence. Rebellious Belarus, its dictator dependent on Russian support, was in hand; so too the war-torn Caucasus. The large and oil-rich Kazakhstan itself requested Russian peacekeepers during a bewildering bout of street violence in January 2022. Strangely, the elite Russian troops soon departed from Kazakhstan. A month later, the whole world realized that they had been dispatched to Ukraine, the last sizable piece of Mr. Putin’s post-Soviet gambit. And there his plan broke down.

> History has a habit of serving the same lessons with changed variables. In 1988, it was the dreamer Gorbachev stumbling over Nagorno-Karabakh that unwittingly shattered the world order. Today, Mr. Putin could become the second, much darker incarnation of the Kremlin aggrandizer going awry on all fronts. The consequences — from emboldening international aggression to reanimating the West under the banner of NATO — will be profound. As events in Nagorno-Karabakh show, the fragile post-Cold War order is giving way to something else entirely.

> The Caucasus might seem strange and distant. Yet it might prove the wedge that turns the fortunes of world order. Trieste, Smyrna, Sarajevo, Danzig and Crimea were all such places. Let us not have to relearn history at the cost of yet another ethnic cleansing."

It is vital that we don’t re-circulate videos or images that may show our positions on the front line. The Armenian military has already asked that people don’t post any information regarding this invasion.

Trust me I know how badly we want to know what’s going on, but for the sake of our country we can’t. No matter how well intentioned a video of a tank moving through a village for morale may very well lead to the death our Armenian troops. Save lives don’t post.

**Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

Recently the UK based Conciliation Resources released a documentary jointly produced by Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists. This is agreed to be the most neutral account of the conflict ever made, you can watch it online here: https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict

Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through Peace and War by Thomas de Waal is agreed to be the best book on the conflict: https://nyupress.org/9780814760321/black-garden/

---

**Is there a peace plan?**

Azerbaijan and the Armenian side have agreed in principle to the settlement process mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group co-chaired by the US, Russia and France with a mandate from the UN, which since 2009 has consisted of the following proposal:

 > The ministers of the US, France, and Russia presented a preliminary version of the Basic Principles for a settlement to Armenia and Azerbaijan in November 2007 in Madrid.

 > The Basic Principles reflect a reasonable compromise based on the Helsinki Final Act principles of Non-Use of Force, Territorial Integrity, and the Equal Rights and Self-Determination of Peoples.

 > The Basic Principles call for inter alia:

 >- return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control;

 >- an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

 >- a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

 >- future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

 >- the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and

 >- international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

 > The endorsement of these Basic Principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan will allow the drafting of a comprehensive settlement to ensure a future of peace, stability, and prosperity for Armenia and Azerbaijan and the broader region.

However there has been no meaningful progress in the negotiations, meanwhile the mediating group focusing on containing the conflict proposed to *harden the ceasefire regime* following the 2016 April ""four day war"" as well as following the [Armenian revolution of 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Armenian_revolution) made a proposal to the sides to *prepare the populations for peace*. 

[Thomas de Waal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_de_Waal):

> Russia, the US and the EU have enough tools to contain both sides, but they have neither the time, nor the energy, nor the desire to try to force Armenia and Azerbaijan to conclude peace, let alone send peacekeepers who will have to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

[Sergey Markedonov (Carnegie Moscow Center)](https://carnegie.ru/commentary/experts/1196):

> Russia is well aware that the search for compromises is the business of the Armenian and Azerbaijani sides. They are not ready for this, but no one will do this work for them.

**What disinformation is prevalent about this conflict?**

One of the most entrenched disinformations is that pertaining to the nature of the UN Security Council resolutions on the conflict. 

The UN Security Council resolutions concern with and recognise the invasions and occupations of the [*surrounding territories*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_Nagorno-Karabakh#:~:text=The%20Armenian%2Dcontrolled%20territories%20surrounding,of%20Artsakh%20supported%20by%20Armenia.) of Nagorno-Karabakh carried out by local Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh.

The UN Security Council resolutions 

1. do NOT recognise Republic of Armenia having invaded or occupied any territories, 

2. do NOT recognise Nagorno-Karabakh as occupied or invaded territory,

3. do NOT demand Republic of Armenia to withdraw forces from any territories,

4. do NOT demand any forces to be withdrawn from Nagorno-Karabakh.

> **Information Point**

> - **What is all this about?** On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with Turkish backing launched a war against the de facto Nagorno Karabakh Republic in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) through military means despite the existing peace process.

> - Azerbaijan has targeted 120 civilian settlements, including the capital Stepanakert with drones, missiles, smerch and artillery bombardment as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing half of the civilians to leave Nagorno Karabakh.

> - **Is Nagorno Karabakh occupied?** No. Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refrain from labelling Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, instead often label it as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918. 

> - Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) has three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - [Map with place names](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/02/fighting-nagorno-karabakh-is-about-local-territories-wider-rivalries/)

> - The four [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories. Instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and the latter to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions concern the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993.

> - **Is there a peace plan?** Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution package by OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

9/21/2023,Pashinyan addressed the public (translated with Source),"The source in Armenian: https://www.civilnet.am/news/751512/փաշինյանի-խոսքով՝-40-հազար-ընտանիք-տեղավորելու-շուրջ-նախապատրաստական-աշխատանքներ-են-իրականացվել/

Currently, there is no direct threat to the civilian population of Nagorno Karabakh. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced this a while ago, addressing the citizens live.

""I have accused Azerbaijan for a long time that they are subjecting the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to ethnic cleansing. Now that we are analyzing the situation, we get the impression that there are forces that want to carry out the Azerbaijani plan to subject Nagorno Karabakh to ethnic cleansing so that Azerbaijan, so to speak, has no reason to be blamed. In other words, let's say: look at Armenia, the Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh decided that no Armenians should stay in Nagorno Karabakh and they left,"" Pashinyan noted, adding that preparatory works were carried out to accommodate approximately 40 thousand families in the republic.

""But we don't want to say about this, why, because we believe that the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh should live in their land.

Pashinyan also added that the previous day more than **10 thousand people were invited to Stepanakert airport for transportation to Armenia**.

""**They were photographed and videotaped, after which they said that the Republic of Armenia does not allow you to go to Armenia**. It is obvious to me that this is being done in order to cause internal political upheavals and tension in Armenia,"" said Pashinyan, adding that currently various circles ""want the government to shed blood in Yerevan"", which will not happen. the government will be within the law and strict.

#About the violation of the ceasefire regime in Artsakh

Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan also provided information on the current situation in Artsakh. In particular, he said that after the establishment of a ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh, **the units of the Defense Army continue to stay in the places where they were at the time of the establishment of the ceasefire**.

""Today, unfortunately, an incident took place near Stepanakert, in general the ceasefire regime is maintained. I saw that there are reports that Azerbaijani troops are in Stepanakert, of course, there is no such thing,"" said Pashinyan.

According to him, there are certain problems on the road leading to Martakert and Martuni.

""One of the issues that take our greatest attention is **information about mass casualties** among the civilian population, which simply do not correspond to reality,"" he said.

Pashinyan asked not to forget for a moment that from the beginning he stated that one of the goals of this process is to involve Armenia in military operations. ""This is one issue that aims to create chaos in Armenia. The fact that a ceasefire has been established in Nagorno-Karabakh does not mean that these goals are no longer on the agenda of the people who brought them,"" added Pashinyan.

He emphasized again that Armenia was not in any way a participant in the discussions on establishing a ceasefire in Karabakh, it was only aware of the processes.

He also blamed the Russian peacekeeping troops, saying that one should not turn a blind eye to all the lapses made by the peacekeepers in Artsakh.

#About the Evlakh meeting

Pashinyan also referred to the meeting between the representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan in Evlakh. He said that the authorities of Artsakh have not yet published official information, but the **Azerbaijani side has presented details and tried to create an impression that the processes are proceeding in a positive direction**.

According to Pashinyan, **this may have something to do with today's meeting of the UN Security Council**, where the humanitarian situation in Nagorno Karabakh is discussed."

> **Information Point**

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the UN-mandated OSCE settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refer to Nagorno Karabakh as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed autonomous region since 1923 which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918 until today. Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history going back millennia.

> - The ceasefire agreement in 1994 had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh. 

> - The UN Security Council resolutions do not recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, nor demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh, nor recognise Armenia as an invader, nor demand any withdrawals by Armenia, instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Nov 4 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 50 civilian killed, 148 wounded and 19000 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict).

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

> - US Department of State in-depth [discussion of conflict resolution](https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/averting-all-out-war-nagorno-karabakh).

> - Entities backing the OSCE peace plan: [UN General Secretary](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign), [EU High Rep Foreign Affairs](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell),  [NATO Sec. General](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), [Council of Europe Sec. General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the UN-mandated OSCE settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refer to Nagorno Karabakh as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed autonomous region since 1923 which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918 until today. Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history going back millennia.

> - The ceasefire agreement in 1994 had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh. 

> - The UN Security Council resolutions do not recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, nor demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh, nor recognise Armenia as an invader, nor demand any withdrawals by Armenia, instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with [Turkish](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) backing and using [Syrian mercenaries](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire due to the pandemic](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162).

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the indigenous Armenian population of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has severely damaged 130 civilian settlements including the capital Stepanakert with aerial, drones, missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic and artillery means as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of October 16, Azerbaijan's violence has resulted in: A total of 36 civilians have been killed - a little girl, 7 women and 28 men. A total of 115 people were wounded, of which 95 received serious injuries: 77 of them are male and 18 are female citizens. Severe damage inflicted upon civilians properties: 7800 private immovable properties, 720 private movable properties, 1310 infrastructure, public and industrial objects including [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html). Over 700 Armenian military personnel and volunteers have also been killed, making the KIA per capita higher than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE led by the US, France and Russia, and backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe, among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The European Parliament passed a [resolution in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20) supporting the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with the Armenia SSR.

> - The four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) call for cease of hostilities and mandate the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions mainly concern the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories. 

> - Same as above applies to the only existing non-binding UN General Assembly [resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the Un-mandated OSCE process to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The majority of states also abstained from voting in favour of said resolution.

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous as per the constitution of the de facto republic. 

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

> - US Department of State in-depth [discussion of conflict resolution](https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/averting-all-out-war-nagorno-karabakh).

> - Entities backing the OSCE peace plan: [UN General Secretary](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign), [EU High Rep Foreign Affairs](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell),  [NATO Sec. General](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), [Council of Europe Sec. General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

Both their officer corps were products of Soviet military education and presumably fought using the same tactics and strategy they were trained in under the USSR.

According to Wikipedia at least the Azeri side had much more equipment and a much larger population. It rather vaguely cites more experience on the part of the Armenians but doesn't go into much detail. 

Why were the Armenians able to win despite the two armies having similar force-structures, but the Armenians have material inferiority relative to the Azeris?"

9/26/2023,"A blast in Nagorno-Karabakh injures more than 200, while thousands flee to Armenia","An explosion at a fuel storage facility in the Nagorno-Karabakh region wounded over 200 people and prompted thousands to flee to Armenia.


**The Cause and Effect:**  The blast took place at a fuel storage site near Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, and reportedly injured over 200 people.
* The cause of the blast is yet to be determined, but it occurred while locals were lining up for fuel to leave the region.
* Many of the victims were described as being in ""severe or extremely severe"" condition, necessitating air evacuation for medical treatment.


**Political Background:**  The explosion followed a quick offensive by Azerbaijan last week, reestablishing their control over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region after three decades of separatist rule.
* Thousands of ethnic Armenians fled to Armenia, fearing reprisals following the handover.
* As per Armenia's government, more than 6,500 Nagorno-Karabakh residents have sought refuge, while Russian peacekeepers in the region have helped in the evacuation.


**International Response:**  Nations and organizations worldwide have expressed their concern and offered aid in response to the situation.
* French President Emmanuel Macron pledged assistance in terms of food and medical aid for Nagorno-Karabakh and vowed to work towards a ""sustainable peace"" in the region.
* The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Samantha Power, visited Armenia to show U.S. support for Armenia's sovereignty and independence and assist in addressing humanitarian needs caused by recent violence.
* The UN also expressed its worry over the increase in influx into Armenia and offered to provide assistance and conduct humanitarian needs assessments if permitted access to the region.


**The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh:**  The Nagorno-Karabakh region, disputed by Armenia and Azerbaijan, has seen decades of conflict since Armenian-backed forces took control in 1994.
* Azerbaijan recently reclaimed the area and accused the Armenian government of using a key road for illegal activities, leading to a 10-month blockade.
* Turmoil continues as Russia's efforts to maintain peace in the region are questioned, and Turkish President Erdogan declares support for its ally Azerbaijan.

&#x200B;

A new kind of warfare has taken the world by storm this year. While most of us were preoccupied with the election, the coronavirus, and the other exciting events that have taken place over this year when decades happen, a small number of people have kept a close watch on distant battlegrounds in the Middle East; where the face of war has changed since January in ways that few would have predicted--and with it the region as a whole.

&#x200B;

# 1. In the Beginning

But let's go back a ways; to the ancient world of circa 1980. Drones were not a new technology in any sense of the word--but they weren't particularly of interest beyond hobbyists, [target drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Firebee), and occasional odd military projects like the [D-21 reconnaissance drone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_D-21). However, things were changing with the introduction of digital cameras and increasingly capable processors and transmitters as computers rapidly developed--and so it was only a matter of time before someone took advantage of that. That someone was the Israelis. Israel has a high level of technical expertise, large defense needs, but a relatively small industrial base, so it often pioneers technologies of this sort, and so it did with the [Tadiran Mastiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadiran_Mastiff).

&#x200B;

This innovation quickly proved to be of significant utility in the First Lebanon War. Besides spotting Yasser Arafat, leader of the PLO, they played a crucial role in the still-infamous [""Bekaa Valley turkey shoot""](https://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Operation-Mole-Cricket-19-456909) in which Israeli aircraft supported by UAVs destroyed a massive quantity of top-of-the-line Soviet hardware--almost 90 Syrian aircraft and 29 surface-to-air missile batteries at the total loss of minor damage to a pair of F-15s and one UAV shot down. Electronic warfare and AWACs control also proved crucial in this conflict, which in many ways paved the way for the successes of Desert Storm and the 2003 Iraq invasion; and reportedly shattered the self-confidence of the Soviet Union in its air defenses.

&#x200B;

Since that first incident; UAVs have become an increasingly prominent part of the arsenal, particularly of the United States; though Israel and China also manufacture numerous UAVs and theirs are more popular in the export market due to lower prices and fewer scruples about ""human rights"" or ""political stability"". UAVs have become key reconnaissance assets and popular for precision-strike counter-insurgency missions. However, neither the United States nor China can claim credit for the latest developments--and Israel, at best, has played a peripheral role. The nation that everyone is watching now is Turkey.

&#x200B;

# 2. Turkey

For most of history, Turkey; or at least the geographical area of Anatolia, was a great power of some shape or another. The modern Turkey, however, rejected the idea of empire and foreign adventurism under Ataturk; the father of the Republic. While it has generally tended towards the West--directed in that way both softly by the allure of Europe and drive for modernization; and with great force by the military, which has tended to depose any government that even hinted at reintroducing religious or Middle Eastern aspects back into the aggressively secular Republic, Turkey has not been a particularly major player in the past century. Despite joining NATO for protection against the Soviet Union--which despised Turkey's chokehold on the Bosporous--it never had much appetite for interventionism.

&#x200B;

In the era of the ""Great Convergence"", where nations seem to be returning to historical norms of influence and power, it should be no real surprise then that Turkey has become more assertive. It has grown much wealthier thanks to its association with Europe; and that wealth is actually created by the Turks, not dug up out of the ground like it is in much of the Middle East. It is more educated; more progressive \[this of course being a rather relative term\] and, importantly, much better at fighting, than most of its neighbors.

&#x200B;

[Turkey has been working to build a domestic armaments industry with great success](https://www.defensenews.com/native/turkish-defence-aerospace/2020/07/21/how-turkey-became-one-of-the-worlds-leading-manufacturers-of-weapons-systems/)\--barring a handful of key items like jet engines which hardly anyone can manufacture well, Turkey can do most things. In between indigenous development and picking up knowledge from South Korea, China, Ukraine, and so on, Turkey has one of the world's better arms industries--I'd say it's about reached the level that South Korea was at ten or twenty years ago, which is pretty good. Its drone program, however, started because of a different problem.

&#x200B;

The Turks wanted drones back in the early 2000s for what we in the business call ""reasons"". Evidently the United States saw through this; because, despite allowing Turkey to license-assemble F-16s and build parts for the F-35, [it did not sell Turkey drones for fear that they would be used against the Kurds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-05-22/turkish-bid-for-drones-stalls-in-congress-president-gul-says)\[a perception that proved to be correct as Turkey has indeed used its UAVs against Kurdish insurgents\]. As a result, Turkey decided to do it themselves, and started building up their own drone program from scratch. By the beginning of 2020, Turkey had a large drone program and advanced electronic-warfare equipment. But nobody was really paying attention to their drone program; it was a sideshow of limited interest compared to the big players, that would presumably be of some utility but not a game-changer. I mean, their premiere drone literally used an engine made for homebuilt aircraft and was the size and weight of a smart car. Nothing too impressive. That is, until January.

&#x200B;

# 3. Libya

The Libyan conflict is a deeply convoluted one that is difficult to explain. In essence; Libya has been in some sort of civil war since Gaddafi was deposed in 2011, but the most recent division is between the GNA, or Government of National Accord--the UN-recognized government of Libya located in Tripoli--and the ""Tobruk Government"" which acts as a rubber-stamp body for Gaddafi wannabe General Haftar. Haftar started off this year with things looking pretty good. After breaking the second cease-fire agreement in as many years, flush with cash and support from the United Arab Emirates, Russia, and France, Haftar was on the move, pushing for Tripoli itself. It was going to take a while, but nothing could stop Haftar from defeating the ragtag GNA militias.

&#x200B;

Nothing, that is, until Turkey unexpectedly showed up because of a completely different dispute over rights to the seas around Cyprus. Libya \[the GNA to be precise\] was willing to delineate its boundary with Turkey in a way which cut off Greek and Cypriot claims, and, in return, Turkey arrived after a highly contentious vote in the normally placid Turkish Grand National Assembly, with Syrian mercenaries in tow; but also a large number of drones--mostly the [Bayraktar TB2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayraktar_TB2)\-- and [KORAL land-based standoff jammers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KORAL_Electronic_Warfare_System).

&#x200B;

What happened next was a deep humiliation for Russia in particular. Russia and the UAE had supplied General Haftar with a number of its premiere short-range air defense system, the much-vaunted [Pantsir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantsir_missile_system) which was designed to shoot down UAVs, cruise missiles, and other small munitions. Unfortunately, the Pantsir proved much worse at shooting down Turkish drones than serving as target practice for them. [Estimates suggest 23 systems were destroyed](https://www.defenseworld.net/news/27161/Some_23_Russian_Pantsir_Air_Defense_Systems_Destroyed_in_Syria__Libya__Reports) \[Turkey even captured one system and presumably picked it apart for intelligence\] while [perhaps \~16](https://dronewars.net/2020/07/01/libyan-war-sees-record-number-of-drones-brought-down-to-earth/) Bayraktar TB2 drones were destroyed--which doesn't sound terrible until one remembers that those drones caused significantly more destruction than the air-defense systems and come in at a third of the price; and becomes even less favorable when one realizes that as the conflict went on the ratio flipped increasingly in favor of the Turks. Ultimately, the Turks achieved their goal, with Haftar being pushed back to Sirte and another cease-fire agreement being signed. This conflict, however, has contributed significantly to the increasing rift between France and Turkey, and their respective relations with Russia.

&#x200B;

# 4. Syria

Russia likes to test its luck--to see what exactly it can get away with. Invading Crimea, shooting down a civilian airliner, attempting to murder exiles with Novichok. Often, it does get away with it. But when nations actually push back, they often find great weakness--for instance, the infamous incident where [Americans killed 200 Russian ""mercenaries"" in Syria](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/world/middleeast/american-commandos-russian-mercenaries-syria.html) after Russia denied they were Russian soldiers, or when American cyberwarriors [shut down Russian trolls during the 2018 election](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cyber-command-operation-disrupted-internet-access-of-russian-troll-factory-on-day-of-2018-midterms/2019/02/26/1827fc9e-36d6-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html). Nowhere is this more illustrated than in Syria, where, early this year, [a ""Syrian"" airstrike killed 29 Turkish soldiers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrian-airstrike-kills-at-least-22-turkish-soldiers-in-idlib-turkish-official-says/2020/02/27/f3bb8a3a-59a0-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html) even though Russian involvement was an open secret.

&#x200B;

What followed was not the usual vague condemnation and angry letter-writing that one might have expected. Instead, Turkey responded with a substantial escalation of force, again largely done by drones. Ultimately, around 200 Syrian government soldiers were killed in this short offensive--along with 45 tanks, 33 artillery pieces, 33 transport/utility vehicles, 20 armored vehicles, a pair of Su-24 aircraft that attacked a Turkish drone, and several SAM systems, which again proved largely ineffective against Turkish drones. While the conflict stopped before it went any further, the lesson was clear: Turkey was willing to escalate beyond where Russia was willing or able to respond, and there wasn't anything they could do about it.

&#x200B;

Besides having a nice moral--extremely hard pushback is the best way to respond to Russian provocation, because they aren't expecting it and can't fight back [since they lack effective escalation methods](https://preview.redd.it/s66ngo305by51.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=91b8d2ac1b82225686e9c0c08ef80fb5573a00e5)\--this conflict proved again that Turkish drones were highly effective even against a state actor \[albeit a weak one, like Syria\]. The world watched--but nowhere else as closely as Azerbaijan.

&#x200B;

# 5. Artsakh

Artsakh is; or perhaps more aptly *was,* an Armenian state--not recognized by any other state--within the borders of the former Azerbaijan SSR. It emerged out of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, one of the nastier conflicts resulting from the breakup of the Soviet Union. In short; the Soviet Union put an ethnically Armenian area in the Azerbaijan SSR that was semi-autonomous; called Nagorno-Karabakh, that Armenians viewed as rightfully part of Armenia. When the Soviet Union broke apart--even before it had done so completely--Armenia and Azerbaijan were already engaging in low-level fighting; and in scenes reminiscent of the Partition of 1949, Azeris living in Armenia fled the country--as did their Armenian counterparts in Azerbaijan. 

&#x200B;

Then, as the Soviet Union properly collapsed, both sides geared up for war. The Soviet Union had left quite a lot of stuff lying around as it collapsed; and Azerbaijan ended up with the bulk of it due to the disposition of Soviet forces. Both sides bought black-market weapons and armaments from conscript soldiers in the confusion of the the collapse. And then they went to war.

&#x200B;

The result was a years-long, brutal conflict that killed tens of thousands of people--in two relatively small countries--and, despite Azerbaijan having more equipment, more men, and more foreign support--from Turkey, which never had much love for Armenia and was building ties with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia \[of whom the Azeris are one\], and from Israel, who saw a potential new partner in a dangerous region. Armenia had some support from Russia, largely due to connections through a shared religion, nervousness about the Turks, and feelings among the Russian elite that were more sympathetic to Armenia. 

&#x200B;

However, against all odds, the Armenians emerged victorious. In 1994, with the Armenians poised to break out of the mountains and attack the heart of Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan exhausted from years of war, a cease-fire was signed.

&#x200B;

From that day onwards; both nations began preparing for the return of conflict. It was only a matter of time. Armenia had not only taken Nagorno-Karabakh, they had taken large portions of ethnically Azeri land as well, including sites that were of paramount cultural and historical importance to the Azeris. They also engaged in ethnic cleansing, and to this day Azerbaijan, at least nominally, has hundreds of thousands of refugees from the conflict. 

&#x200B;

In the intervening years, however, things changed. In particular; Turkey rose to a newfound regional prominence, and Azerbaijan, though being careful to always maintain a measure of proximity to Russia sufficient to not cause its rulers concern, slowly drifted towards Turkey and Israel. Ties with Turkey stretched to [a mutual defense agreement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_Strategic_Partnership_and_Mutual_Support) [Ties to Israel included offering potential basing in Azerbaijan](https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/03/28/israels-secret-staging-ground/), the sale of oil \[not many nations would sell Israel oil until recently\] along with shadowy intelligence connections--Mossad operations in Iran are believed to be launched out of Azerbaijan \[for a number of reasons, Iran and Azerbaijan don't like each other very much\]. And Azerbaijan, noted for its oil reserves as far back as the Second World War; collected large revenues which it sunk into military spending. Meanwhile, Armenia, despite making large purchases from Russia, fell behind in military readiness, and in its economy--not helped by the fact that, because of a mix of pro-Azeri Turkish policy and Armenian distrust and even hatred of Turkey \[thanks to the fact that Turkey argues over whether even discussing ""those unfortunate events of 1915"" is okay\], the Turkish border remains closed--meaning that trade can only go via Iran or Georgia. 

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, the peace process dithered on, with occasional small skirmishes breaking out. The regular theme was that Armenia would hand over the Azeri-majority \[now unoccupied\] territory it captured, and Nagorno-Karabakh would, in return, be recognized, or become autonomous, or something of the sort. The Minsk Group led these efforts; though not particularly well--all three members had significant biases. The Russians were pro-Armenian though not anti-Azeri \[mostly, they were in favor of the status quo, which favored them\], the French were pro-Armenian \[on account of disliking Turkey and having a politically influential Armenian population much like the Cubans in Miami\], and the Americans were sufficiently pro-Azeri that [they created manuals like this](https://wss.apan.org/3084/Decisive%20Action%20Training%20Environment/DATE_3.0.pdf) and defending the fictional nation of Atropia \[*which just happens* to be an oil-rich, pro-Western autocracy that is exactly where Azerbaijan is\] against foreign invaders [became a meme among the US military](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/6znkzk/after_multiple_invasions_the_us_army_is_getting/dmwki31?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\--you can buy [""Atropia Veteran""](https://www.google.com/search?q=atropia+veteran&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwieuOH0so_tAhWNwVkKHfu0D7YQ_AUoAnoECA4QBA&biw=1920&bih=966) swag, and it became so transparent that Europeans complained about ""defending autocrats"" in the exercise and Turkish officials complained that ""Limaria"" \[Armenia\] included areas that should have been in ""Kemalia"" \[Turkey\]. 

&#x200B;

Ultimately, by 2020, a few things had changed. After victory in clashes in 2016, and purchases of new arms, Azerbaijan was confident that it wouldn't fail due to military incompetence like last time. Armenia had elected a new leader, more distant from Russia \[especially since he came to power in a 'color revolution'\], complicating any Russian response. Not only that, but Armenia had begun settling in territory that was formerly ethnically Azeri, and had attempted to rewrite history so the land they had taken was somehow always Armenian, making a land swap less tenable--especially after the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh was renamed to the Republic of Artsakh. Domestic protests about a lack of action on the issue further spurred action, but perhaps the most decisive factor was Turkey's drone-fueled rampage and Russia's no good, very bad year elsewhere \[from the domestic economy to the chaos in Belarus\]. 

&#x200B;

So at the end of September 2020, they went to war.

&#x200B;

# 6. Curb-stomp battle

[Course of the conflict by Liveuamap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_war_every_day_\(Liveuamap\).webm)

&#x200B;

Initially, the war looked like it was serious, but not out of line with previous escalations. Azeri and Armenian forces clashed along the border--but then Azerbaijan made a major incursion along the southern border, which is flat and nearly completely unpopulated, and through the rest of the war pushed through there until they ultimately cut the single road leading to Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia when they recaptured Shusha. At that point, Armenia capitulated.

&#x200B;

While the exact details of why this happened are of relatively little importance, what does matter is what drones did. Armenian air defenses proved completely defenseless against the onslaught of Azerbaijan, with even larger and heavier systems like Russia's S-300 being destroyed by Turkish-manufactured drones. [Even the An-2, a literal Soviet 1940s cropdusting biplane, proved lethal to air defenses when rigged with the right equipment](https://www.overtdefense.com/2020/10/05/azerbaijan-reportedly-convert-ancient-an-2-biplanes-into-drones/). 

&#x200B;

As a result, Azerbaijan swept across Armenian forces with drones, targeting anything larger than a bicycle, destroying tanks, artillery pieces, and surface-to-air-missile systems alike. While initially Azerbaijan didn't advance, they pursued a strategy of attrition against Armenian forces--and were quite successful at it. Nowhere was safe for Armenian infantry--even miles behind the front, drones were still a risk. After a few weeks of this, Azerbaijan began their offensive. This was interrupted by several ceasefires, the most successful of which lasted around fifteen minutes. 

&#x200B;

In the meantime, Armenia and Azerbaijan engaged in tactics reminiscent of the War of the Cities. Armenians made rocket attacks on Azeri civilian targets, and even [ballistic missile strikes with SCUDs and Tokchas against Ganja](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/17/13-killed-in-gan), an Azeri metropolis, with later attacks also taking place against Barda and other targets. Virtually all sources agree that Armenia conducted a deliberate policy of targeting civilians in retaliation from the advance of Azerbaijan. 

&#x200B;

Azerbaijan, meanwhile, adopted what I would characterize as a callous indifference to Armenian civilian lives. We have relatively little documentation on exactly what they did, but it is likely that major war crimes were committed against Armenian prisoners. However, we do know that [rockets and cluster munitions were used against civilian areas of Stepanakert.](https://apnews.com/article/europe-azerbaijan-armenia-2a63dad13bcdb456030e19221bdfbd2d) By and large, though, Azerbaijan's government is mindful of global sensitivities and would rather avoid making itself a bigger villain than it has to be. 

&#x200B;

# 7. Ending

By the first week of November, despite appearances, it had become clear Armenia was losing. While they still held most of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, Azeri forces were rapidly closing in on the major road \[1 of 2\] that connects Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia proper. Armenian forces were demoralized and lacked heavy equipment. Civilians fled; with most of the population of Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, fleeing before the road was cut. Analysts had few doubts that, within another few weeks, before winter arrived, Azerbaijan could take all of Nagorno-Karabakh.

&#x200B;

But fortunately, several factors coincided. First, Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan realized the situation Armenia was in, and presumably began talking about peace. President \[and resident dynastic autocrat\] of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev had achieved most of the territorial gains he wanted, but as far as I can tell had little to no interest in making his country notorious for what would surely be the ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of people. Russia was interested in making sure that *any* deal possible happened that could salvage its privileged position in the region. And since Azerbaijan had acheived its major goals, Turkey was alright with suing for peace as well.

&#x200B;

The final impetus was provided by the Azeris taking Shusha, the second-largest city in the region \[and one of tremendous cultural importance to the Azeri people\], and, at around the same time, the Azeris accidentally shooting down a Russian attack helicopter on the border. 

&#x200B;

The ultimate deal was *incredibly* favorable to the Azeris, which should be expected given that they could have taken the rest of the region with relative ease. It involved [Armenia vacating most of Nagorno-Karabakh](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/10/21558428/armenia-azerbaijan-war-nagorno-karabakh-russia-turkey) and all the ethnically Azeri land they had taken, bar the Lachin Corridor. Of particular importance to Turkey, and to the Azeri economy, was that the deal created a corridor through Armenia to Azerbaijan's western exclave, and hence to Turkey, for transit. While still an indirect route, it is nowhere near as difficult as traveling around through Georgia. Russia also got to pretend like it still mattered by deploying a few thousand peacekeepers for what seems likely to be a limited time.

&#x200B;

Azerbaijan celebrated. As far as anyone was concerned, they had won. Turkey also celebrated--they had, in their view, not only supported the Turkic Azeris in a victory against the Armenians, but also won a battle against Russia to see whom was the real dominant power in the Caucasus. Russia didn't celebrate, but felt that it had at least maintained some sort of influence in the region when initially things looked like they might ultimately sideline Russia entirely. Armenia, however, unsurprisingly, was enraged, and rioters smashed government buildings and forced Prime Minister Pashinyan into hiding; however, it looks like the Armenians realize that they really had no chance of winning and aren't going to resume the conflict.

&#x200B;

# 8. What Now?

In a strange twist of fate, there is some speculation that peace is now *more* likely than it was before the war. In particular, some think that Turkey will be interested in finally coming to terms with the Armenians and opening its border with Armenia--which would significantly reduce Russian influence in the region and promote economic development--and some speculate that Azerbaijan may now be willing to make a lasting peace deal since it has, essentially, all that it wants. 

&#x200B;

This war chronicles one of this year's themes--the decline of Russia, and rise of Turkey. I would expect to see more conflict between them in the future, and I'd expect to see, in a strange historical irony, Turkey coming out on top. Russia has not had a very good year at all and I think this conflict is really just the latest example of how far it has fallen in its military capabilities and political influence despite what Putin shows off. 

&#x200B;

Small drones are now the obsession of every military planner, as is trying to figure out a way to shoot them down reliably. Already a number of nations have expressed interest in buying the Turkish drones that had such a decisive impact on these conflicts. It seems likely that this will especially transform lower-end conflicts where foreign powers can now intervene without risking more than a few million dollars in equipment, and where local powers can now field their own drones and precision-guided munitions while being, for the moment, largely unopposed. 

&#x200B;

Whatever the ultimate impact, though, it is undeniable that this change in warfare has been one of the more important and interesting bits of 2020 thus far, though it's behind some truly massive things. Unlike the coronavirus, or Donald Trump, however, these trends are probably with us to stay for a while. I don't think we've heard the last of the drone-warfare revolution yet."

And I'm glad we're neither of them too. We were already rubbing up against the boundaries of propaganda, but watching people on either side of their debate defending their actions is truly disgusting."

Azerbaijan de jure controls a majority Armenian territory where the de facto unrecognized state of Nagorno-Karabakh exists. Naturally Armenia would like to have this territory. 

However when you add international politics into the mix is makes very little sense. Apparently Armenia is supported by both Russia and the US while on the other side Azerbaijan is supported by Turkey and Turkey is an ally of the US. Also the president of Azerbaijan is friends with Lukashenko of Belarus, a nation which is basically Russia’s best friend right now. 

Am I simply misunderstanding the level of US relevance in this conflict? Here in the US it seems that everyone supports Armenia, citing the Armenian genocide and a very large Armenian population with enough influence to sway the country in their favor."

And it's not only their 2008-2013 scandal(including a probably rigged win). Azerbaijani jury in 2015(and other years) was suspicious and so were their results (10 points from a country in semis becoming a 12 in the final and from countries who have zero connection to Azerbaijan whatsoever). In 2022 teaming up with 5 countries to rig the result and making it to the final with 0 televoting points and so much more. Don't get me wrong it's not the only country that has had suspicious results, but it's certainly the only one that keeps doing it and EBU lets it get away. It seems like it's being toned down but we all know whatever they do, EBU won't ban them cause...money

Ps: I also think Azerbaijan doesn't fit in a contest promoting unity and peace when they've been keeping this attitude, to say the least, towards Armenia. But that's a long story and i don't wanna get into it, i just wish to enjoy a contest where there is fairness"

Me and my wife and friends will no longer visit your country for tourism. Azerbaijan is supporting racist Zionist apartheid against Palestinians, and that's just disgusting. I thought you guys were Muslims, and had solidarity with other Muslim countries. Now I see that this country has nothing to do with Islam or Muslims. What was the most shocking was seeing the Zionist apartheid flag waving above the capital in Baku.

Azerbaijan should just call itself a Jewish country at this point. It doesn't make sense to advertise yourself as a Muslim country, but to not follow anything from Islam. This only seems like trademark infringement.

I will tell everyone who is interested in your country to not visit Azerbaijan. I have so far changed many people's plans who were interested in seeing your country. I am proud that Azerbaijan will get less tourists and less money, as they deserve.

PS, I am a white European. I'm not an ""Islamist"" or an Arabic person."

####Welcome to the Day after Debrief discussion thread!

Now that the dust has settled in Baku, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!"

Problem is, it is missing 'authoritarian' and 'hereditary dictatorship', which exists in the Syria (Assad family), Turkmenistan and North Korea (Kim Family) articles. Of course the world is well aware of Assad and Kim! For those who aren't aware, Azerbaijan has had the same president Aliyev since 2003, which he inherited from his father, who came to power in the 1990s. Also Aliyev's wife is vice-president!! Country is beyond nepotistic, corrupt and authoritarian. No election has been deemed as free and fair, the opposition is heavily controlled and monitored in election cycles (similar to the situation in Russia under Putin).

I don't know who watches this article, but they are doing an absolutely horrible dishonest job, and my requests on the talk page for this edit to be made have been ignored. If Aliyev's article describes him as the most corrupt person of the year and a dictator, why doesn't the country's article have 'hereditary authoritarian dictatorship'? Shouldn't it be consistent and factual?

I was wondering what are Armenians thoughts on Iran helping Armenia maintain its sovereignty. 
Iran has offered time and time again to help Armenia with weapons, building base, doing joint military drill, etc.. but for some reason Armenia keeps denying.
Does the general population of Armenia not like Iran? A lot of iranian media is claiming right now that Iran wants to help Armenia more then Armenia wants to help itself. 

I would really like to understand, Thank you 
Much Love"

\----------------Hey everyone, it’s KFateweaver, your faithful servant, back at it again with yet another Anatolian themed report. Today we’ll be taking a look at Armenia and its revolution. This content is supposed to be released as part of a regional update.

# The Armenian Revolution

During the Ottoman struggle against the rebellious Cairo Pact, the agitation brought by the war and the Iranian intervention will allow the Armenian rebels acting in Azerbaijan and to a lesser extent also in the Van area to take control of the province by toppling the local Turkish garrisons. Led by the famous revolutionary Garegin Nzhdeh, an Armenian nationalist with some rather extremist tendencies, [they will first try to ensure the survival of the insurgency by gaining some momentum](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952969390683488286/unknown.png). On that end, they will have some possibilities, including the development of the Armenian army and the stabilisation of the fragile alliance forged between the various forces of the Armenian political scene.

During this period, Nzhdeh will also be able to increase his control over the nation, allowing him to become more than a figurehead leader of the revolution in the near future. He can achieve this goal by centralising the army and by building a cult of personality around himself.

# After the Revolution

If the Armenian revolutionaries managed to withstand the Ottoman forces, there are basically two scenarios: Either Nzhdeh has succeeded in cementing his power (represented by the popularity of Paternal Autocrats being above 50%), or he has failed and the democrats managed to establish a democracy.

In both scenarios, [an economic tree will be unlocked](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952970178600247316/unknown.png). This tree will first be focused on rebuilding the country, and then on creating a new Armenian economy. The same goes for the military tree, which will obviously be focused on keeping the army in shape in order to defend the young country.

# The Tseghakronism/National Defence Path

If Garegin Nzhdeh managed to secure his control over the nation, there are two possibilities for the development of his political thought. If Russia is ruled by a National Populist party and Savinkov came to power, then Nzhdeh will see the Russian regime as an inspiration and try to fulfil his deepest political fantasies, and create a National Populist country. He will seek to create a totalitarian state based on the tribal and racial Tseghakron movement, which argues that Armenians should always come first and believes in the racial superiority of the Armenian people. Still, building this nation will not be a simple task, and his project can be knocked down if the Armenian democrats succeed at leaving the country and securing the support of an intriguing neighbour.

However, if Russia isn’t Savinkovist, then Nzhdeh won’t be able to fully apply his political thought, and will be limited to Paternal Autocrat. Instead, he will use his influence in the military and in the revolutionary Dashnak party to secure his power by forging an alliance between the two and by creating a special State Defence Organisation. [This path](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952969703133954098/unknown.png) will be focused on turning the Armenian nation into a stronghold that can defend itself even against superior foes.

# The Democratic Path

If Nzhdeh stayed a mere figurehead, then a “true” Armenian Republic will be declared by the democratic coalition. This coalition will be composed of both socialist revolutionaries and more moderate democratic parties. The first election will be between the socialist and democratic parts of the coalition. [If the socialists win](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952969852635725864/unknown.png), then they will organise a congress and choose the form of government they want. This will result in one of two parties taking the lead: Either the Hunchaks (Radical Socialists), a socialist revolutionary party under the leadership of Rouben Ter Minassian, or the Armenian Communist Party (Totalists), which will be led by Anastas Mikoyan.

Nevertheless,[if the democratic part of the coalition won the election](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952970013671821312/unknown.png), it will thereafter organise a Presidential Election, in which either a candidate from the Ramgavar party or the famous and moderate Dashnak candidate Hovhannes Kajaznuni will be chosen. While the Ramgavar party (Market Liberals) advocates a liberal economy based on neoclassic thought, the Dashnaks (Social Democrats) support a more social economy. As for foreign policy, both of these parties will try to find a way to prevent external threats from invading the country by signing reconciliation treaties.

Finally, a picture of all possible Armenian leaders:

2.Azerbaijan keep open borders in Karabakh for armenian people/doesn't force citizenship etc
3.US-Turkey-Azerbaijan in return sign the deal that they are guaranteeing Armenian internationally recognized borders
4.Turkey acknowledges genocide and pays off reparations.

This is what i think the best case scenario is, maybe overtime Armenians and Azerbaijan will start to tolerate-like eachother and Azerbaijan will peacefully give up Karabakh (after their current president is gone), if you dont believe this is possible look at post ww2 japan germany etc

Armenia says 12 of its soldiers were killed and 15 were taken prisoner. No reports of confirmed causalities on the Azeri side. Btw, this happened in internationally recognized Armenian territory, not Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh.

##war against Kemalist Turkey and Bolshevik Russia: ex-PM of Armenia and ex-mayor of Tbilisi Alexander Khatisian recalls the struggles for independence during the First Republic 

**KHATISIAN:** Upon my arrival in [Gyumri] I developed personal impressions of the situation at the frontline and the general mood in the population. The situation was sad. There was no enthusiasm. No one believed in our victory. 

We received a briefing from commanders from the Kars-Gyumri region. Our assaults on Turkish troops were unsuccessful. 

We proceeded to Yerevan. The city had its usual appearance. The railway traffic was slowed down to prioritize military trains. I met the political and military leadership to discuss the situation on the frontline.

Commanders Nazarbekyan and Hakhverdyan reported that despite the unsuccessful assault on Turkish forces, our army still had sufficient stamina. Simon Vratsyan had just arrived from Kars. He was under the impression that our forces were in a great mood but their commanders were weak and lacked leadership skills.

I asked the commanders how long Kars could withstand as a castle. They estimated two months. Upon learning details about the enemy army, I expressed my opinion that the war should continue. 

The council issued multiple orders to strengthen our defense. Everyone went home in a good mood. Kars was standing. Dro's forces were holding the enemy back in Surmalu. 

[...]

Our government was negotiating with the Soviet Union [Bolsheviks] to secure the most favorable conditions: 1) Independence for Armenia, 2) Annexation of Turkish-controlled Armenian vilayets. In return, Russia wanted to have all sorts of transit rights via Armenia. 

We were approaching the fateful day of October 30. But before that, let me share with you the memo sent to me by our diplomat Tigran Bekzadyan written in August 1920. It describes the situation on the ground.

##... the memo by BEKZADYAN, Armenia's ambassador to Georgia; classification: secret:

Your Excellency. It has become imperative for Armenia and Georgia to establish foreign relations with Bolsheviks after their invasion of Azerbaijan and the Northern Caucasus. The Russian government had hinted that they would respond favorably to Armenia's request for independence if Armenia offered a peace deal.

An Armenian delegation was dispatched to Moscow on May 5. *[apparently, it took 15 days to reach Moscow]*. Our goal was to convince Soviet Russia to recognize our independence, and not to intervene in our internal and foreign policies. These negotiations have not yielded any results so far.

There are several factors that contributed to these delays in negotiations, with the primary ones being:

(1) Kemalists [Turkey] are fighting against the Entante states and the peace agreement [the West]. They want to receive assistance from Russia and Azerbaijan, by using Armenian lands. They view Armenia as an obstacle to creating a monotonous Muslim state stretching from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. Kemalists also want, with the help of Bolshevik Russia, to challenge the Western dominance in the East and Asia.

(2) Russia wants to establish a connection to Kemalist forces to use them to destroy Western capital and dominance in the East and Asia. Russia also wants to connect to Iran by using Armenian territories.

In both scenarios, Armenia is the main obstacle to the implementation of these programs. Lately, we've seen more attempts by Bolsheviks and Azeris to implement their plans. 

Kemalists and Azeris have focused on the borders with Armenia. On the other side, the Russian Bolsheviks, under the pretense of applying preventative measures to prevent the Armenian-Azeri conflict from causing international clashes, have invaded Karabakh, Syunik, and Nakhijevan. The Kemalist-Azeri forces have also entered these regions. 

But that didn't last long, and the Bolsheviks were pushed out. They proceeded to receive reinforcements from the Soviet army in Karabakh and the Kurdish cavalry from north-eastern Syunik. Our troops were outnumbered and were forced to retreat to Bazarcha/Sharur, where they were cornered and assaulted again from all directions by Bolsheviks, Kurds, Azeris, and Molokans. Dro's tiny army was unable to withstand.

Bolsheviks concentrated their forces near Gazakh [presumably Tavush region]. They assaulted unquestionably Armenian ~~regions~~ villages, invading several of them. This movement threatened to cut off our railway communication and completely neutralize it.

We passed this information to the Georgian government. The latter sent a note of protest to Moscow about its assault on Armenia. 

Concerned over the prospect of losing the aforementioned regions, the Armenian government decided to expedite the peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Bolsheviks demanded the three contested regions as a precondition for a ceasefire agreement. Armenia had no choice but to agree.

However, Armenia found it impossible to cede the aforementioned regions to Azerbaijan and expressed hope to reach an agreement through some kind of compromise. But if Azerbaijan, with the help of its allies [Bolsheviks and Kemalists], decides not to make any concessions and another armed conflict becomes inevitable, then it won't be Armenia's fault.

Armenia hopes that during these peace negotiations, our people will gain some peace, so we can organize the harvest and therefore the next military draft. In the meantime, our soldiers will have enough time to train to use the new weapons we received from England. Right now we need our soldiers to rest, arm themselves, and feel confident about the safety of their families.

These are the primary challenges we face today: 1) We are broke, 2) We don't have fuel, 3) We don't have means of transportation.

Your Excellency. The millions of dollars you've brought *[the diplomat is writing this letter to Alexander Khatisyan, who has just returned from a worldwide trip to collect cash and meet Armenian diaspora, basically 20th-century Himnadram]* ... the millions of dollars you've brought can help us overcome these unbearable conditions.

The government has decided to spare no means for defending our borders and rights. To this end, the government has announced new conscription throughout Armenia and coercive measures to strengthen the army. //

##Armenian-British military collaboration: 1918-1920

>Armenian-British military cooperation was on strong footing during the short life of the first Armenian Republic. 

>After independence, Armenia was an ally of Great Britain, a member of Entente. 

>This alliance is clear by the fact that Armenia continued to wage war against Turkey, which was among the most active opponents of Entente, and Turkish troops had suffered undisputed defeats and bypassed Armenia.

Georgia had claims over the Kars region, too. Population of Kars at the time: 123k Armenians, 103k Turks, 55k Kurds, 4k Georgians, ... Alexander Khatisyan visited Tbilisi, Georgia, to discuss the issue of Kars with General Walker, England’s supreme commander.

It ended with the border being drawn in the following way: 
 
>Ardahan Province’s northern part, above Ardahan city, the other side of the Poskov River, went to Georgia, and temporarily, the western part of Kars, from Merdenek westward, would stay under English command as a zone that directly shares a border with the state of Batumi. 

>the provinces of Kars and Kaghzvan, along with the Kars fort, as well as the city of Ardahan, were to be turned over to Armenia, which included the Alexdropol-Kars-Sarikamish-Karaurgan railroad. Oltisi Province, evidently, was to remain to the Turks.

England assigned Colonel Temperley to enforce the handover of territories to Armenians. English generals came to meet Armenian commander Dro and others to discuss the deployment of Armenian troops in Kars. There would be 1,200 Armenian and 3,000 English troops. Colonel Temperley was appointed as military governor, while Stepan Ghorghanyan was appointed civilian governor.

>it was a very big deal for Armenian forces to enter Kars. It was an occasion that created much enthusiasm among the people

The local Turkish governor [Shukra Pasha] refused to hand over power to the Armenian counterpart, so the English Colonel Temperley issued a warrant for his arrest. The guy was able to escape, however. Colonel Temperley summoned the rest of the Turkish militias and gave them 3 minutes to comply, which they did. 

The General of the Armenian army spent 6 weeks in London in 1919 to discuss military assistance. Great Britain’s foreign secretary Lord George N. Curzon continuously insisted on assisting Armenia. 

After the defeat of the White Army in Russia, Great Britain had doubts that Georgia and Azerbaijan could resist the Russian Red Army, but the foreign minister ""insisted in assisting the Armenian people, saying that Britain has a moral debt to pay the Armenian people.""

>Lord Curzon came forth with a special speech. After praising the bravery of Armenians, and insisting that they would be able to secure themselves if they are supplied with adequate weaponry, he went on to say that the suffering of the Armenians must be ameliorated, and promises by the warring nations towards the Armenians must be kept

Great Britain announced the preparation of assistance 7 days later.

**Prime Minister Lloyd George about Armenia:** It depends entirely on the Armenians themselves—whether they protect their independence. They must do so; they must begin to depend upon themselves. 

They are an exceptionally intelligent people. In fact, it is their intelligence that gets them into trouble sometimes, from all I hear. That is what is so obnoxious to the Turks. I am told that they could easily organise an army of about 40,000 men. 

If they ask for equipment we shall be very happy to assist in equipping their army. If they want the assistance of officers to train that army, I am perfectly certain there is no Allied country in Europe that would not be willing to assist in that respect. 

That is far and away the best thing for themselves. It would increase their self-respect. It would make them a manlier and more virile people. Instead of always casting themselves upon other countries and sending supplications and appeals, let them defend themselves. When they do so the Turk will have too much respect—not for them, but for himself—to attempt any more massacres in that quarter. //

Later, artificial obstacles were created by Great Britain's War Office. They decided to sell the weapons at a high price instead. Then they claimed issues with the delivery. Foreign minister Lord Curzon called it unacceptable and summoned meetings. 

They finally agreed to send 48 field guns, 400 machine guns, 25,000 rifles, 40,000 units of military outfits, 1077 first aid kits, various military hardware, telescopes, compasses, gun repair kits, canned food, etc. 

The War Office demanded a hefty fee, to which Armenia agreed. On top of it, Georgia demanded 27% of the shipment as a transfer fee. Avetis Aharonian, chairman of the parliament of Armenia, expressed gratitude for the weaponry. There were also discussions to send 40 military advisors, on top of those who had already beein Armenia for 2 years, and aircraft. 

The head of the Armenian army, during his multi-week trip to London, visited factories to study the production of bullets. No equipment was subsequently purchased because Armenia was broke. Later they were supposed to send something, but the War Office blocked it again, citing unrest in Armenia and the Armenian government's decision to hold negotiations with Bolshevik Russia. Winston Churchill was concerned that British weapons could fall into the hands of the Bolsheviks.

There were efforts to move England's unused aircraft from Egypt to Armenia but the War Office blocked it again, citing Armenia's financial constraints and lack of expertise to use the aircraft. The Foreign Office was able to convince the War Office to supply aircraft, however. Many aviation experts began visiting Armenia. Armenia purchased 2 English airplanes.

>The quantity of the supplied weapons was very large for the Armenian army, and the cost in today’s value would be about 80 million British pounds, which is quite a significant loan amount for a single year even by today’s standard.

##Azerbaijani forces kidnap 3 ethnic Armenian students who were crossing the Azeri checkpoint illegally installed in Lachin corridor 

The students are professional soccer players who supposedly burned down the Azerbaijani flag as a sign of protest earlier. Azerbaijani authorities plan to charge them with ""disrespecting"" Azerbaijan. The students will remain under arrest for 10 days before being deported to Armenia. They will not be allowed to return back to their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh anymore. A protest was organized in front of the Russian embassy in Armenia for allowing the Azeri regime to kidnap the students.

The World Court had earlier ordered Azerbaijan to end the illegal obstruction of the 2-way movement through the Lachin corridor. Azerbaijan has not complied. 

**GOVERNMENT OF ARMENIA:** These kidnappings once again give reason to believe that Azerbaijan is planning to subject the entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh to collective punishment. 

The entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh is deprived of all fundamental rights, food, medicine, gas, and electricity, while Azerbaijani snipers terrorize people, kidnap residents, and block the corridor to Armenia.

This demonstrates the true aspirations of the Azerbaijani leadership. They are avoiding dialogue with Nagorno-Karabakh at all costs and instead continue the policy of ethnic cleansing. //

##Commissioner for Human Rights at Council of Europe: Restore free movement along the Lachin Corridor and ensure the rapid and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance in Nagorno-Karabakh

**Dunja Mijatović:** Despite numerous calls by international stakeholders, the humanitarian and human rights situation in the area has further deteriorated due to the prolonged disruption in the movement of people and access to food supplies and urgent medical care.

The relevant stakeholders should immediately find a solution to avoid any further deterioration of the very dangerous situation.

I confirm my readiness to engage with all the relevant interlocutors and to travel to Nagorno-Karabakh to assist in overcoming the existing human rights challenges.

##Public International Law & Policy Group's report on Nagorno-Karabakh: External self-determination via remedial secession

>The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth the argument that the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh are entitled, at a minimum, to the right of internal self-determination and that the current negotiations should provide for the meaningful and effective protection of this right. 

>As such, Nagorno-Karabakh’s Soviet-era autonomous status should serve as a benchmark for discussions between Armenia and Azerbaijan concerning the future fate and status of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

The report analyzes the pre-1990 mistreatment of ethnic Armenians by Azerbaijani authorities:

>Prior to 1988, Azerbaijan's human rights record with respect to the
Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh was rather dismal. During the seven decades of the USSR's existence, the government of Soviet Azerbaijan conducted a systematic policy of repression and removal of Karabakh Armenians from their historic homeland. 

>During this time, the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh was reduced from ninety-five percent of the total population of the
region in 1926, to seventy-five percent of the population in 1976. 

>In the nearby Azerbaijani-administered enclave of Nakhichevan, the Armenian population was reduced from 40% of the population to zero. 

>Subsequent to the Karabakh movement for independence in 1988, the human rights violations against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh intensified, including “pogroms, deportations, and other atrocities.”

Conclusion:

>In the event that Azerbaijan refuses to accept that Nagorno-Karabakh’s
Soviet-era autonomous status be included on the agenda and serve as a benchmark for discussions between Armenia and Azerbaijan concerning the future fate and status of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, this is a clear signal of a continued rejection of that right for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, and this opens the door to the possibility of external self-determination via remedial secession

##Nagorno-Karabakh president changed his mind and refused to resign after learning that Gen. Samvel Babayan could become the next leader: journalist Tatul Hakobyan reveals details 

Context: It was claimed that Arayik Harutyunyan had promised to resign but broke the promise under unknown circumstances. Journalists Tatul Hakobyan and Petros Ghazaryan discuss the events.

**TATUL:** First of all, Russia's 14-point document [that outlines the subjugation of ethnic Armenians to Azerbaijani rule] is an authentic paper. Moscow passed it to Stepanakert through Yerevan. Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians are joking that they wished it was written by Azerbaijan so it would have more favorable terms. It's great that people maintain their sense of humor.

**PETROS:** Let's discuss the situation around the resignation of Nagorno-Karabakh president Harutyunyan.

**TATUL:** During the closed-door meeting, Harutyunyan complained about Russia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, and announced that he can no longer manage the crisis. He said he would resign but ended up not doing so. Here is what happened...

They were supposed to nominate a new candidate for the presidency. The parliament would then elect the candidate as the new president. 

That's when Harutyunyan saw a threat of a takeover by Samvel Babayan because Harutyunyan's ruling party members, who hold the majority in parliament, declared that they would not necessarily vote in favor of the candidate nominated by Bako Sahakyan, Robert Kocharyan, or Ruben Vardanyan [the former regime]. They said they would vote freely.

Despite my rocky relations with Samvel Babayan, I think he is the only party that at least has proposed plans. The others aren't doing anything. 

**PETROS:** What is the ruling party's and Harutyunyan's plan? They rejected the initial negotiations, then they accepted it, then they wanted the negotiations to take place not here but there, and then they changed their mind and agreed.

**TATUL:** I agree. But if you place yourself in Harutyunayan's shoes, he is under immense pressure. 

**PETROS:** Does the former regime's candidate have a plan?

**TATUL:** I haven't heard anything. Their idea so far is to force the government out so they can come to power ""to solve the problems"".

##S&P upgrades Armenia from 'B+' to 'BB-' on robust growth and improved fiscal position; outlook stable

Spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine conflict helped Armenia's economy to expand significantly by 12.6%. The growth is expected to slow but remain at 7.5% in 2023. Armenia's IT sector has expanded by 51%, partly thanks to the migration of skilled Russian workers.

The worsening economy in Russia, the end of the migration-related benefits, and possible clashes with Azerbaijan could harm the economic growth, but the recent increase in human and financial capital could strengthen Armenia's potential growth rate. 

The average annual real GDP growth rate will be 4% until 2026.

**Information Point**

- Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

- The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the UN-mandated OSCE settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

- The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh.

- The UN-mandated OSCE is backed by France, Russia, US, UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

- All reputable international media refer to Nagorno Karabakh as disputed and do not use the term occupied.

- Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed autonomous region since 1923 which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

- Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918 until today. Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history going back millennia.

- The ceasefire agreement in 1994 had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh. 

- The UN Security Council resolutions do not recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, nor demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh, nor recognise Armenia as an invader, nor demand any withdrawals by Armenia, instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh.

8. Sabotaged peace talks and assasinated their leaders who wanted to sign a peace deal

They screwed over absolutely everyone. There is not a single country involved here who has not been screwed over by Armenia. But for the love of Mickey Mouse and anime, they are somehow the victim in all of this. Everyone else, be it Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, EU, Israel, or the US, is either literally Hitler, or literally helping Hitler.

2/21/2021,Andranik Ozanian (a National Hero of Armenia) vs Ramil Safarov (a superstar of Armenian propaganda),"Before giving you quotes about what exactly Andranik did to become a National Hero of Armenia, let me remind you that Andranik Ozanian is one of the main heroized persons of Armenia after whom the streets, schools and even a subway station were named in Armenia, add here monuments in every single Armenian town and his endless promotion in Armenian diaspora of US and Europe.

Also, let me remind you Ramil Safarov who became a ""National Hero in Azerbaijan"" (but only according to Armenian media) and a fact how Armenians condemned Erdogan for mentioning Enver Pasha in Baku Parade because Enver Pasha was a ""bloody person who killed thousands of innocent Armenians"".

So let's go:


From Robert Gerwarth, John Horne. War in Peace: Paramilitary Violence in Europe After the Great War. — С. 179.:

>""In 1918, Andranik rejected the Treaty of Batum as a Turkish dictate and moved to Zangezur with a paramilitary division estimated to have three to five thousands men, followed by many thousands of Ottoman Armenian refugees. In the self-proclaimed ""Republic of Mountainous Armenia"", comprising the multi-ethnic districts of Nakhichevan, Zangezur and Karabakh, Andranik's paramilitary units massacred and expelled the Azeri population.""

From Justin Mccarthy. The Ottoman Turks: An Introductory History to 1923. — С. 380.:

>""As a result of ethnic cleansing organized by Andranik, 180 thousand people, 2/3 of the Muslim population of the Erivan province, were massacred or expelled"" 

From Булдаков В.П. Хаос и этнос. Этнические конфликты в России, 1917-1918 гг.: условия возникновения, хроника, комментарий, анализ. — Москва: Новый хронограф, 2010. — С. 893—894. — 1096 с.:

>""According to the report of the Zangezur district chief, there were cases when the Armenians asked Andranik to destroy certain villages - for example, according to his message of September 12, the villages of Rut, Darabas, Agadu, Vagudu were destroyed, and Arikli, Shukur, Melikly were also set on fire.  Pulkend, Shaki, Kiziljig, the Muslim part of Karakilisa, Irlik, Pakhlilu, Darabas, Kurtlyar, Khotanan, Sisian and finally Zabazdur, in which 500 men, women and children were killed"".

From Justin McCarthy. Death and Exile the Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims. — С. 215: 

>""To the President of the Parliament:
We ask you to inform the Minister of Internal Affairs of the following requirement: Is the Minister aware of the fact that during the past three weeks in the territory of the Armenian Republic within the boundaries of Echmiadzin, Erivan and Surmaly districts, a large number of Tatar villages, including Pashakend, Takarli, Kurukh-Giyun,  Ulalik of the Taishukhur society, Agveren, Dalelar, Purpus, Alibek of the Arzakend society, Dzhan-Fida, Kerim-Arch, Agjar, Igdalu, Karhun, Kelani-Aroltkh of the Echmiadzin district were cleared of the Tatar population and committed to robbery and massacre.  That the local police not only failed to prevent it, but took part in the robbery and massacre;  that these events left an imprint on the local population, which is disgusted with these pogroms, and who want to live in peace with their neighbors and demand that the criminals who have not yet been punished be brought to justice and punished.""

The telegram from Armenian commander Foma Nazarbekov to Armenian Parliament. From Justin McCarthy. Death and Exile the Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims. — С. 247.:

>""Please inform the Turkish commander that Andranik and his entire unit, who do not obey my orders and were dismissed from service, are committing really cruel actions against the population of the Nakhichevan region.""

From Richard G. Hovannisian, Armenia on the Road to Independence, Los Angeles, 1967, p. 194.:

>""The routes south were blocked by regular Turkish divisions. Backtracking, Andranik then pushed over Nakhichevan into Zangezur, the southernmost uezd of the Elisavetpol guberniia. Remaining there for the duration of the world war, Andranik's forces crushed one Tatar village after another.""


From Donald Bloxham. Interlude: The Genocide in Context // The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians.:

>""From mid-1918, Andranik was prominent in the destruction of Muslim settlements during the purging of the Armenian-Azeri border region of Zangezur. Hovannisian describes his actions as the beginning of the process of 'transforming Zangezur into a solidly Armenian land'. Alexandre Khatisian, one-time Prime Minister of Armenia, used similar language, averring that 'it was not the will of the diplomats which was to bring about homogeneous populations in this or that region, but through the course of elemental behaviour'. Andranik was stopped from expanding this policy into Karabakh by the local British commander, who had his own distinct political agenda.""


Andranik Ozanian became a National Hero of Armenia for reducing the percentage of Azerbaijani population of today's Armenia from 46% to 8% just within two years."
9/22/2023,What do the protesters/protest leaders reasonably expect from Pashinyan?,"I'm a neutral party in this conflict, but I'd like to understand this one thing. I ask this with all due respect.

* From watching him, it seems to me that Pashinyan has worked to try to modernize and democratize Armenia, get closer w/the West and bring peace through European and Democratic principles and diplomacy.
* Pashinyan also came to power *due to* massive protests and a Velvet Revolution - to get away from old school, corrupt/Soviet ways.
* For the reasons above, he was negotiating w/Azer. etc. trying to bring a peaceful resolution to the over century old conflict.
* Azerbaijan is way more powerful militarily than Armenia - w/Turkish financial and military support and their NATO weapons and training.
* By international law, Nagorny-Karabakh/Artsakh is recognized as Azeri territory (not saying it's right or not, just something playing against Armenia here).
* The West hasn't given much support to Armenia, and is now too occupied w/Ukrainian conflict.
* Russia, who is the biggest thing that resembles an ""ally"" (I put in quotes for a reason) to Armenia has all of its attention and resources occupied in Ukraine, as well as can't afford to upset Azer. and esp. Turkey, who they need for national interests, again due to war in Ukraine. Armenia has no other countries to back them.

What do these ""oppositionary"" leaders and protestors expect Pashinyan to do?

It seems that they want him to use the Armenian army to keep Karabakh/Artsakh from integrating into Azerbaijan - to what end? To have massive casualties in an all out war with a much more powerful force, and with Aliev in charge, possibly lead to end of not only Karabakh communities but the actual country of Armenia as well?

There's a good chance I'm missing something, which is what I'm trying to ask about here. Please no propaganda for any side, just objective reasoning. Thank you.

**Edit:** Do most people in Armenia support Pashinyan in the above? What about people in this sub? Do you agree that due to being helpless, ""giving away"" NK/Artsakh is needed to keep Armenia and citizens safe?

So one of the very active moderators of r/Armenia has accidentally given away his identity in several posts. He works for the Armenian Government and is a vocal supporter of Pashinyan and his policy of getting close to Turkey (he is probably from the Liparityan camp). This means that r/Armenia has essentially become an Armenian Government propaganda platform. Many users are not aware of this fact and think of r/Armenia as a neutral platform where they can get their daily information. My question is, is there something one can do about this? I consider this a huge problem with Reddit's 'anonymity', where government officials can disguise themselves as honest actors and push a specific agenda. Obviously this applies to Reddit as a whole, which has become a propaganda platform for the United States (there is a very good article about how certain American officials are now employed in high, decision-making positions in Reddit). 

Thanks."

I counted an additional twelve roads going into and out of Nagorno-Karabakh. Thus alleged humanitarian crisis due to alleged closure of one road is literally impossible, as there are other roads to bring in supplies. 

Thanks to Armenia, the Agdam-Khankendi road proposed by Azerbaijan to transport humanitarian supplies to Karabakh Armenians was discussed at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. In a sense, what Azerbaijan had been trying to say to the world for the past eight months, Armenia accomplished in one week by dispelling the falsehoods of Lachin road being the ""only road to Karabakh"" and ""road of life.""

10/10/2023,"simple logic: If the Zangezur Corridor would genuinely benefit Armenia and make Armenia stronger, then Aliyev would not have proposed it in the first place, and Turkey and Russia would not support it"," 

The so-called economic benefits of the Zangezur Corridor are just Aliyev's bait. The so-called Zangezur Corridor won't bring actual benefits to Armenia; instead, it will worsen the security situation and provide Aliyev with a new pretext for war.

I can almost imagine what would happen if this corridor were actually opened and passed through Armenia. First, you would see a flood of so-called Azerbaijani refugees returning to find their homes, some of whom may be genuine, but most would likely be hired actors. Next, you would hear news of attacks on Turkish and Azerbaijani people on the Zangezur Corridor, and there might even be heartrending stories of Russians being harmed while protecting Turks and Azerbaijanis from Armenian terrorists. Subsequently, Turkey and Azerbaijan would demand police intervention, and regardless of what Armenia does, these two countries would not be satisfied.

Then there would be various propaganda, bots, and trolls spreading fake news online. News of Armenia tolerating domestic terrorist attacks on Turkic people would spread across the internet. Turkey and Azerbaijan would soon demand entry into Armenia to secure the safety of the caravans on the corridor and eliminate the security threats posed by terrorists. The justification would be that Armenia has an obligation to protect the corridor's security, and since it's now unsafe, Armenia has breached the agreement. Turkey and Azerbaijan should take responsibility for the security of this route. Meanwhile, public opinion among the people of these two countries would label Armenia as ungrateful, accusing it of extracting economic benefits while supporting terrorists.

Soon, there would be discussions of annexing southern regions of Armenia or even completely destroying Armenia. These areas would likely be recognized as Armenian territory by both countries, but the Armenian population there would undoubtedly leave voluntarily, much like how Turkish forces carried out ethnic cleansing of Kurds in Syria. Ironically, factions affiliated with Al-Qaeda, such as the Nusra Front, are currently cleansing Turkmen in Syria, but Turkey needs these people to counter the Kurds, so they turn a blind eye to the slaughter and expulsion of their own kin.

Facing reality, as long as Erdogan and Aliyev remain in power, any agreement reached with Turkey or Azerbaijan is inevitably reduced to scraps of paper. These despots do not care about the lives of their own compatriots, let alone the rights of Armenians or Kurds.

I personally support historical reconciliation and regional cooperation among the Caucasus nations, but this cannot happen under the rule of Aliyev, Erdogan, and those like them. These two individuals have trampled upon nearly every agreement they have signed. Any friendly gestures towards them may be seen as weakness. They only understand one language: strength, not economic cooperation and peace."

9/9/2023,“Western Azerbaijan” Propaganda history + origins,"First and foremost բարի օր to everyone!

So something that really interests me about Azerbaijan + Azeri society nowadays is this absolute hard-on they have for claiming the entirety of Armenia as their ancient and ancestral homeland. I find it mind boggling how after winning the 2020 war they’ve gotten so bold that mainstream Azeri news channels literally refer to our nation as West Azerbaijan. 98% of their population is on the edge of their seats hoping and praying that they annex us and “return to their lands”. I don’t mean the ones on reddit who claim that that’s not true, I mean the average joe you would pick off the street in Baku.  You would think they would put in more effort and propaganda into the whole “South Azerbaijan” thing considering theres literally 20 mil. of them in northern Iran where they’re the overwhelming majority. But now out of nowhere places like Armavir, Sevan, and Yerevan are their main interest. Why? 

And does anyone else find it weird how all of a sudden everyone in Azerbaijan has an ancestor that lived in Armenia? So I have a few questions I would like to have answered if any kind souls would want to take the time to do so:

1. Is the whole “West Azerbaijan” propaganda new, or did it exist during soviet and pre soviet times as well?

2. Being as unbiased as possible, what were the absolute max number of Azeris that lived in the borders of what is now modern Armenia in the past? To my knowledge the max it’s ever been is like 200k in the 1880’s (and Armenians were 900k). 

3. For any lurking Azeris, what’s your take on all this?"

I feel like an Armenian state that is not a part of Armenia makes no sense, so I genuinely don’t understand why the option of the Armenians in the Artsakh territory (not including the territories recaptured by Azeris in the 90s) let them join as a part of Armenia with a Lachin corridor (owned by Azerbaijan, controlled by Turkey) connecting it to Armenia proper and a Zangezur corridor (owned by Armenia, controlled by a foreign power like France or Russia or America) connecting Nahkchivan to Azerbaijan proper… to me this seems like the most logical solution that would result in long term peace and least problems. It is clear to me that the Armenians currently in Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh are unwilling to be a part of Azerbaijan, nor is Azerbaijan willing to host them as equals, so is this a solution you would accept? 

Please explain why this is or is not an acceptable solution in the comments, any response appreciated. Thank you 🙏"

11/11/2020,Pashinyan's actions were much more brave and commendable than he is being given credit for,"Signing the agreement, ending the war, and stopping the killing of Armenian soldiers and civilians should have always been top priority. The man had the balls to admit defeat and lower himself to such low levels as to sign a deal with Azeris only to put a stop to the fighting and killing.

Those who oppose this deal have a point. He gave them what they wanted, he let them win, he rewarded their atrocious behavior. We did not get justice, the good didn't prevail. All that is true.

But, as a leader, his job is to look at the bottom line and to make the unpopular decision where it is necessary. Armenia was losing the war and never stood a chance. A small and poor country full of lions would still lose 2 big and rich countries full of hyenas and jackals.

The alternative would have been to keep fighting and letting more and more Armenian young men die to eventually lose the lands anyways and setting Armenia back another 50 years in progress. The priority now is to build a future for Armenia with or without Artsakh. This involves social services, education, technology, business, and military.

Edit:

It is very unfair to be cruel towards Diaspora Armenians. Over the years they have lobbied foreign governments, raised money, and helped Armenia a lot. It's one thing to have an ancestral homeland where one is born and raised, it is another to grow up in a place where you have to speak one language inside your home, and a different one when you go outside. Please be polite and fair towards your diaspora brothers and sisters and please do some critical thinking before believing every bit of idealized propaganda with regards to this subject.

Edit 2: 

I'd like to add some more thoughts. It is an absolute tragedy that we lost historic ancestral lands to the Azeris. It is also tragic that most of the residents of Artsakh probably don't want to return to their homes out of fear. My commentary above is only regarding the latest situation and resolution, not what happened in the past, but what was done given the most recent circumstances. At the end of the day, the signing of the agreement was to preserve the most important part of Armenia: its people. If we are going to make it into the future, we need our next generation who will build Armenia, fill its technology education centers, and improve the country from within. Knowing how to pick a fight and when to admit defeat is a virtue, not a weakness. Living to fight another day is a blessing, and one that we should not take for granted. "
10/2/2023,"Rahim Shaliyev: The promoted mythical character “Armenian” and “Armenia” has existed in Azerbaijani society for 30 years. […] Over the past 30 years, the Aliyev government has turned Azerbaijan into a fabricated, mythical “Armenia.”","Full Tweet: The promoted mythical character “Armenian” and “Armenia” has existed in Azerbaijani society for 30 years.

Propaganda preaches that this “Armenian” character serves Russia, bribes politicians around the world and beheads Azerbaijani soldiers.

He also preaches that: “In “Armenia” there is no ethnic minority, there is no opposition, there is only a one-party system in the country called “Dashnaktsutyun”.

Over the past 30 years, the Aliyev government has turned Azerbaijan into a fabricated, mythical “Armenia.”

What is attributed to the mythical “Armenia” has become the narrative of the Aliyev regime.
Now there is a single party system in Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan serving for Russian interests, ethnic minorities are under pressure, and bribery in AzeGov has reached worldwide levels. Azerbaijani soldiers behave like maniacs. So, Aliyev turned Azerbaijan into a fabricated “Armenia”. 

If someone talks about bribery in Azerbaijan, problems of national minorities, etc. and when someone criticized the situation, the answers are usually like this:

“Armenians also bribe world politicians”, “There are no national minorities left in Armenia either”, “Armenians beheads the same way”, “Armenians do this too, why don’t you tell them?” etc.

Aliyev legitimized his illegal actions with these myths. He preached to Azerbaijani society to be like ""Armenians"".

In fact, over the past 30 years, real Armenia and Armenians have made great progress in the democracy and human rights. But we have become an ugly, mythical character of our own making.

Also i know how hard it could be to be Armenian in Russia sometimes. Despite that i never experienced something like that here. I talked many times with people about it, they disliked Russian politics but never the people. It really touched me from the start.

Well, this is what I think.

-Russia is a huge threat to Europe. It directly borders EU, and field the largest army in the entire continent.

- It currently invades Ukraine and commit warcrimes there. It also threatens to invade other countries, which many are in the EU. 

-They talk about reconquering the USSR borders.

-They are allied with China, which is a totalitarian dystopia and threatens many countries.

-They have nukes.

Meanwhile, Azerbaijan:

-Merely threatens Armenia, a small nation in Caucassus which has no significance to Europe in terms of military, diplomacy and economy. And let's not forget that Armenia is in a military alliance with Russia.

-Azerbaijan enjoys good relations with all of its neighbors except Iran and Armenia.

-Carries gas to Europe, which reduces the Russian hegemony on Europe's gas, which is always welcome.

-Supports Ukraine in many ways.

-Their claims are accepted by people, which means:

a)They are simply right in pursuing their cause, so no one wants to side with Armenia

b)They excel at propaganda when compared to Armenia, which is huge given that there are many armenians living in important countries and actually affect their politics.

Armenians, do you know the geographic difference between former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and Arsakh (have to misspell it because the word is not allowed here) as two entities? Please just honest answers.

Do you understand where the majority of the Azerbaijani refugees came from?

Do you understand that by adding the surrounding 7 regions that were never part of Nagorno Karabakh into Arsakh you whitewashed ethnic cleansing of 700.000-800.000 internally displaced people?

I think Armenians still don’t get it and neither do stupid Western journalists. It’s frustrating as hell reading these articles and seeing that they just pick one but list statistics of the other. For example, someone on Twitter today “Arsakh never had more than 40.000 Azerbaijani population, your fabrication of refugees is government propaganda.”

When Armenians of Garabagh rejected the autonomy offer (Madrid Principles) their parliament voted to add the «buffer zone» into their unrecognized republic.

Also, mods why don’t you allow Arsakh in body text - stupid rules. We can’t event have an educational discussion here."

Air sirens were activated in Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday after Azerbaijan launched a massive air and land assault on the republic after months of preparing the ground with false accusations of ""provocations by Armenians"". It's a tactic commonly used by Azerbaijan ahead of every aggression to mislead the international community.

The targets were civilian structures in settlements and Nagorno-Karabakh's local Defense Army's positions along the line of contact. Drones, artillery, and missile systems were/are being used. The Republic of Armenia withdrew its army from Nagorno-Karabakh shortly after the 2020 war. With this attack, Azerbaijan is attempting to subjugate the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh by disarming their local defense forces. 

##... casualties as of late evening

27 dead (1 child, 2 civilians)

200 wounded (>12 children, dozens of civilians)

Azerbaijan said it has captured 60 positions along the line of contact.

##... before the aggression

Azerbaijan claimed they had informed Russia ahead of the attack. Russia said they were informed only minutes before the launch. They requested Azerbaijan to ensure the safety of Russian peacekeepers. They are in talks with Azerbaijan about the situation.

Russia said its peacekeepers will not take action against Azerbaijan's aggression unless Azerbaijan targets them first.

##... the goal is to force ethnic Armenians to leave their homeland 

**MFA of ARMENIA:** Guided by a sense of impunity, Azerbaijan openly took responsibility for the aggression. We strongly condemn Azerbaijan's aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh and the mass atrocity crimes which is the continuation of the 2020 war. 

We have repeatedly warned that the continuous aggressive actions of Azerbaijan, the warmongering rhetoric, and the reprehensible propaganda of calling the population of Nagorno-Karabakh ""terrorists"" pursues one goal: to subject the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to ethnic cleansing through the use of force and deprive them from the right to live freely and in dignity in their own homeland.

We call on international partners, members of the UN Security Council, and the Russian peacekeeping contingent to undertake clear and unequivocal steps to put an end to Azerbaijan's aggression. //

**PM PASHINYAN:** Azerbaijan's aggression began with an artillery attack, followed by a ground invasion of border positions and some villages. The goal is to subject the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to ethnic cleansing. Russian peacekeepers must take action. Secondly, the UN Security Council must take action. 

If Azerbaijan claims this is an ""anti-terrorist"" operation not targeting civilians, then why did they announce the opening of a humanitarian corridor for the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to leave the region? If their intention was not to target civilian settlements, they should have urged civilians to take shelter instead of leaving the region. *[Azerbaijan said they will allow ethnic Armenians to exit the republic via Lachin corridor.]*

Armenia never gave Azerbaijan a mandate to commit ethnic cleansings in Nagorno-Karabakh. The rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh must be guaranteed.

Any attempts to involve the Republic of Armenia in a conflict is unacceptable. There are internal and external forces who want to drag Armenia into a large-scale conflict to endanger Armenia's sovereignty. Armenia will not take any drastic steps at this time. Stay vigilant and wait for official updates. //

##... the future presence of Russia in the region will depend on their peacekeepers' response to Azerbaijani aggression: analyst Sergey Melkonyan

**MELKONYAN:** The choice is simple: either Russian peacekeepers guarantee the fulfillment of the Nov. 9 agreement and subdue the aggressor, or the war in the zone of responsibility of peacekeepers will take place under their passive observation. In that case, it will no longer be necessary to talk about Russia's role as an exclusive security provider.

##... Russia's response

Russia requested ""both sides"" to establish a ceasefire. A ranking member of Armenia's ruling party expressed disappointment over Russia's bothsidesism rhetoric.

Lately, Russia has been accusing the Armenian side [unclear if referring to Yerevan or Stepanakert] of not fulfilling certain ""obligations"". The Armenian government wants Russia to clarify what this ""obligation"" is. Armenia says it has met all the Nov. 9 obligations. 

**Analysis:** Azerbaijan wants a 'corridor' through Armenia that will be outside of Armenian control. Armenia says it's prepared to provide a transportation route to Azerbaijani traffic, monitored by Armenian and Russian customs agents jointly to ensure the safety of Azerbaijani travelers. Azerbaijan has rejected the offer; they want only Russian or Azerbaijani agents to monitor it.

Russia has not publicly clarified what exactly it wants from Armenia, and whether it expects a ""corridor"" passing through Armenia. Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan's media outlet had earlier accused Russia of covertly working with Azerbaijan to establish a Russian-controlled sovereign corridor passing through Armenia. This would be against the Nov. 9 agreement.

Azerbaijan and Russia have kept the population of Nagorno-Karabakh under blockade since December 2022 after the Armenian government's refusal to grant the ""corridor"" to Azerbaijan. //

##... Armenian PM Pashinyan's media outlet claims Russia gave Nagorno-Karabakh's Defense Army's equipment locations to Azerbaijan

**ArmTimes:** According to sources, the Russian side provided Azerbaijan with the coordinates of equipment and structures in Nagorno-Karabakh before moving away from the mentioned positions to allow Azerbaijan to launch the attack.

##... Russia's ex-president Dmitri Medvedev: Can you guess what's awaiting Pashinyan?

Dmitri Medvedev said that Pashinyan will be removed from power for strengthening Armenia's relations with the West.

**KAREN SARGSYAN, analyst:** I normally wouldn't take Medvedev seriously because he is known for making provocative statements, including about nuclear strikes and the Ukraine war. But it's entirely possible that he has been briefed on certain activities that are being planned in Armenia. 

We knew that Kremlin didn't want Pashinyan in power but this is the first time a high-ranking official is openly stating it. I'm not surprised. By formally remaining part of the Russian-led block, we are depriving ourselves of the ability to establish closer cooperation with the West. 
The darkest time is always just before sunrise. We are closer than ever to Kosovo's scenario. Nagorno-Karabakh must fight for dignified self-governance or statehood. //

The pro-Russian opposition forces gathered in front of the government building with demands for Pashinyan's removal. They clashed with the police in an attempt to break into the building. Over 30 police officers and protesters were injured. 

Other protesters gathered in front of the Russian embassy to complain about Russia's inaction and for allowing Azerbaijan to carry out ethnic cleansing. They encircled the embassy. Analyst Karen Sargsyan said the goal was to entrap and starve out the Russian ambassador. Russia's MFA sent a note to Armenia requesting the blockade to be lifted.

##... interview with Armenia's National Security Council chief Armen Grigoryan || Russia is not a reliable partner

**GRIGORYAN:** As we have repeatedly warned, Azerbaijan is attempting to carry out an ethnic cleansing and genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**REPORTER:** Is the target only Nagorno-Karabakh?

**GRIGORYAN:** Events in Nagorno-Karabakh have a direct impact on the internal stability of Armenia. Just as on November 9, 2020, we see certain forces with the direct support of external forces [Russian] are targeting the government. 

**REPORTER:** Why hasn't the government prosecuted those who have committed violence and called for a coup in Armenia over the past 3 years? Isn't your lax policy at fault? Why is the state allowing this? 

**GRIGORYAN:** There are objective and subjective reasons for them not being behind bars. These are individuals who are being used by foreign states. I think everyone in Armenia understands this now. The public has already judged them by ignoring their calls.  

**REPORTER:** They blame you for the current situation, for harming the relations with Russia. 

**GRIGORYAN:** If they think Russia bases its strategic goals on individual level then we cannot take Russia seriously. As for the ongoing propaganda campaign to blame Armenia for the situation, it should be noted that Azerbaijan is the genocidal aggressor here.

**REPORTER:** The opposition blames you for the cooperation between Russia and Azerbaijan.

**GRIGORYAN:** Russia has been cooperating with Azerbaijan for a long time now. They started selling weapons worth $5 billion to Azerbaijan a decade ago. Armenia did not make any changes to its foreign policy vector after we came to power in 2018, at least not until 2022.

Russia has very clear obligations under the Nov. 9, 2020, Statement to protect Nagorno-Karabakh. What is their issue with the Armenian government in this context? Do they mean there is something more important than Vladimir Putin's signature under that document? Is it worth nothing? 

Russia has not been fulfilling its obligation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan has launched a large-scale attack under the inaction of Russian peacekeepers.  

Russia claims it learned about the attack just minutes before the launch. In reality, we've been informing them and the world at least since September 4th about Azerbaijan's pending aggression. Pashinyan sent a letter to Putin, describing the entire situation. 

**REPORTER:** The pro-Russian opposition claims since you're conducting NATO exercises in Armenia, sending the First Lady to Kyiv, ratifying the Rome Statute, all of these are interpreted as hostile steps by Russia so they are choosing not to help.

**GRIGORYAN:** None of the steps taken by Armenia that you've just listed existed before December 2021, yet Russia displayed inaction after Azerbaijan's invasion of Sotk/Khoznavar direction in May and November. Facts show that Russia is not fulfilling its obligations. Even the Prague meeting hadn't taken place yet. 

Instead, Russia adopted Azerbaijan's arguments claiming that the reason is the lack of delimited AM-AZ borders. In reality, we do have fixed borders under the Alma-Ata agreement. Russia could have protected those borders if it wanted to. They'd rather blame Armenia endlessly. Something is wrong with our skin and eye color, we may find out one day. 

**REPORTER:** They say you came with anti-Russian policies in 2018.

**GRIGORYAN:** We entered Syria under the Russian flag. We voted in support of Russia in every institution. We remained in CSTO and EAEU. Our vector didn't change. But in the end, all we got was a Nagorno-Karabakh war in 2020 and the invasion of Armenia in 2021-2022. None of this has to do with the Prague meeting. Real allies help instead of finding excuses.

**REPORTER:** Should Armenia intervene in the ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh? 

**GRIGORYAN:** The army of the Republic of Armenia continues to defend only the Republic of Armenia. As for the Nagorno-Karabakh situation, the international community, and first and foremost Russia, must take steps. Russian peacekeepers have many obligations other than providing medical aid. Their primary role is to protect the safety of the civilians. Vladimir Putin's signature is on it. 

**REPORTER:** Dmitri Medvedev threatened to destroy the Armenian government. How do you plan on cooperating with Russia after that statement? 

**GRIGORYAN:** It's something that Russia should think about. They should clarify that policy because it is against the Republic of Armenia in general. There is a war and they are making such statements? I think the Armenian public will show an adequate response to that.

If Russia wants to remain in this region, they must take steps to prevent the ethnic cleansing and genocide. If they don't, that means they have chosen to leave the region. // *[sounds like an ultimatum]*

##... calls are made to nationalize Russian companies' assets in Armenia 

**Ioannesian, Informed Citizens NGO:** Armenia gave Russia a monopoly for gas, all the important economic hubs, the nuclear plant, railways, membership to CSTO and EAEU, all this in exchange for security guarantees. 

It's obvious now that Russia has joined our enemy. Now they are trying to organize a coup in Armenia.

Immediately nationalize Gazprom-Armenia, take over the control of railways and the nuclear plant, remove the 102nd Russian military base from Armenia and their border guards, and shut down the broadcasting of Russian state media in Armenia. //

##... major Russian opposition media outlets and figures took a more pro-Armenian stance 

Putin critic Vladimir Milov, a former Russian government member, believes ethnic Armenians cannot be ruled by Azerbaijan because the latter is a dictatorship that cannot guarantee the physical safety of Armenians, especially considering the history of massacres of Armenians in various settlements of Azerbaijan. He joined the EU and condemned the aggression. Milov said he had warned Armenia not to trust Putin with Armenia's security. *""Putin spat on Armenia.""*

##... interview with ex-PM Aram Sargsyan

**SARGSYAN:** The world has seen conflicts like this. There was a similar situation in Kosovo. Azerbaijan has adopted Serbia's policies. The UN decided to deploy peacekeepers after Serbs invaded territories and took hostages. The Hague ruled it a genocide, prompting the world to recognize Kosovo's independence. 

The difference with Nagorno-Karabakh is that while the leaders of Kosovo had been working with the West for a year, the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh chose to cling to Russia and dismissed the ""British tanks that cannot climb our mountains"". I've warned on numerous occasions that the only way to save Nagorno-Karabakh is by deploying international peacekeepers. 

My brothers, you followed Russia and removed President Arayik Harutyunyan from power in Nagorno-Karabakh, replacing him with some security agency agent. And what is the result? Do you want the same in Armenia now?

**REPORTER:** Explain the connection with Arayik's removal.

**SARGSYAN:** During his press conference Arayik urged the world and Russia to open the Lachin corridor within 15 days. I've been in touch with Arayik and I'll open a secret now *[here we go again]*: I listened to his stance and informed him that I'll convey his message to the U.S. ambassador in Armenia. Arayik's stance was that if within 15 days the world didn't do everything possible to open the Lachin corridor, a mass starvation would begin, prompting the Nagorno-Karabakh government to request a safe corridor to evacuate the entire 120,000 population out of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

If Arayik was in power right now, he would have made that request, [prompting a strong response from the West and more pressure]. Today's president will not do this because that would be against Russian interests. Russia needs 5,000 ethnic Armenians with Azerbaijani passports to remain in Nagorno-Karabakh so they can keep their troops in this region.

**REPORTER:** Why shouldn't Armenia become part of Russia, like Tatarstan? We are surrounded by enemies. Maybe that's the best option. 

**SARGSYAN:** Independence is a supreme value. I would have arrested you for even suggesting that if I were the authority. 

**REPORTER:** I'm just asking. 

**SARGSYAN:** Hah. Still unacceptable. That would be the end of Armenia. The path to our survival is to break free of Russia. Declare right now that Armenia is choosing the U.S. nuclear technology for its next reactor. The U.S. first made an offer to install modular reactors in Armenia 3 years ago. You could diversify the reactors' geographical locations for security and power grid management purposes. They are also very seismically resilient due to their capsular design.  

The UN Security Council session is on Thursday. The government of Nagorno-Karabakh must send them a letter stating that Russian peacekeepers aren't fulfilling their duties, and make the following demand: either send international peacekeepers or ensure a safe exodus of ethnic Armenians out of Nagorno-Karabakh. //

##... EU's response to Azerbaijan's aggression

The EU requested Azerbaijan to cease the attack and added: *""This military escalation should not be used as a pretext to force the exodus of the local population.""*

**EU:** We condemn the military escalation along the Line of Contact & in other locations in Karabakh.  We call for an immediate cessation of hostilities & for Azerbaijan to stop military activities. //

##... Norway's response:

>Continued use of Azerbaijani military power may force the Armenian population to flee the region and create a humanitarian catastrophe. Such a tragedy must be avoided at all costs.

##... France's response

France condemned Azerbaijan and requested a UN Security Council session on September 21. ""France places the exclusive responsibility for the fate of the people of Nagorno Karabakh on Azerbaijan.""

France is in touch with the U.S. and EU. A phone call was held between Pashinyan and Macron.

##... U.S. response

Pashinyan spoke with Anthony Blinken. They both emphasized the need to use international mechanisms for de-escalation.

**BLINKEN:** The U.S. calls on Azerbaijan to cease these military actions immediately. These actions are worsening an already dire humanitarian situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and undermine prospects for peace.  As we have previously made clear to Azerbaijan, the use of force to resolve disputes is unacceptable and runs counter to efforts to create conditions for a just and dignified peace in the region.  We call for an immediate end to hostilities and for respectful dialogue between Baku and representatives of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh.


##... UK's response 

**UK:** The return of military conflict is devastating for the local population. Azerbaijan should cease military action. U.K. working hard to urge dialogue. 

##... Germany accuses Azerbaijan of breaking a promise 

**FM of Germany, Baerbock:** Over the past few weeks, we've spoken with the Azerbaijani side and received promises for the safe passage of humanitarian convoys, and that there won't be violence. We see that this promise was broken.

**PM Scholz:** Baku must immediately stop the attacks and return to diplomacy to reach a peaceful solution.

##... response by Freedom House:

Any attempt to forcibly change the region's demographics is illegal and unacceptable. We strongly condemn the Azerbaijani government’s violent attacks in Nagorno-Karabakh, heightening the risk of ethnic cleansing against the region’s Armenian population.


##... POLITICO: Azerbaijan launches attack in Nagorno-Karabakh, announces ‘evacuation’ of Armenian population

[article](https://www.politico.eu/article/azerbaijan-launch-anti-terror-operation-nagorno-karabakh-armenia/)

##... ethnic Armenian civilians in a Nagorno-Karabakh village find themselves encircled by Azerbaijani troops 

Village Yeghtsahogh (Եղցահող) with a population of 150 cannot evacuate residents because they have been encircled. Azerbaijani army targeted the local school.

The village is just north of Mets Shen, another village that was targeted by Azerbaijan shortly after the 2020 war. 

##... Azerbaijani aggression has forced ethnic Armenians of 16 Nagorno-Karabakh villages to leave their homes 

Some of the villages are Khramort, Khnapat, Sarnaghbyur, Nakhijevanik, Machkalashen, and Chankatagh. They are located along the Agdam-Stepanakert road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh's Ivanyan to Azerbaijan's Agdam.

Overall, 7,000 people had to be evacuated out of 16 settlements across Nagorno-Karabakh.

##... calls for negotiations

The Nagorno-Karabakh government urged Azerbaijan to cease hostilities as soon as possible and engage in negotiations. Azerbaijan later stated they are willing to hold talks in the Azerbaijani settlement of Yevlakh under the condition that Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians would dissolve all branches of the local government. No ceasefire has been established as of 2 a.m.

##... members of the European Parliament urged the European Council to discuss sanctions against Azerbaijan

**MEPs:** We condemn in the strongest terms this pre-planned and unjustified Azerbaijani attack on Nagorno-Karabakh. In the absence of an immediate halt to the attack, we call on the EU Council to fundamentally review relations with Azerbaijan and consider imposing sanctions against the responsible Azerbaijani authorities.

##electoral commission is conducting mandatory recount after a tight race in Yerevan municipal elections 

The process will be monitored by the political parties, NGOs, and the press. It will be recorded. A difference of as little as 100 votes could change the number of Council seats allocated to each party, said Informed Citizens NGO yesterday.

The former regime has, without evidence, accused the ruling party of attempting to ""rig"" the vote. The ruling party denied the accusation and said they did not initiate this recount. This recount is required under the law. Three random polling stations will be selected in each precinct for the recount.

##analyst Karen Sargsyan about Yerevan elections

**KAREN:** Tigran Avinyan was perhaps the worst candidate the ruling party could have nominated. He was a pandemic- and war-era figure with heavy baggage. Even many officials within QP did not want his candidacy. The ruling party's mistake was treating Yerevan like the rest of the country. 

Still, I don't think this election indicates the end of Pashinyan. If the turnout was >50% with each party winning similar shares, then perhaps you could argue that.

What's clear after this election is that the former regime has peaked. They only got like 25,000 votes out of 825,000. That's about the size of their biggest crowd during the 2021-2022 protests. 

The state of media health is laughable. People are hooked on Russian-language Telegram channels. The public is consuming Russian propaganda en masse yet even under these conditions they could only get 25,000 votes. //

##Hayk Marutyan's team supports the idea of working with the former regime to remove Pashinyan from power

Context in [yesterday's election results coverage](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16m6bex/the_clown_show_begins/).

Marutyan's ranking party member Isabella Abgaryan was asked to comment on a possible coalition with the former regime and Dog, after Marutyan left the door open in his Monday speech. 

Marutyan's team does not want to sign an official coalition but wants the former regime and Dog to help Marutyan become the mayor. ""We all have the same goal,"" said Abgaryan. The goal is to prevent ""evil"" Tigran Avinyan from becoming the mayor. 

**QUESTION:** How would this setup work, though? If the ex-regime and Dog vote for Marutyan without a formal coalition and join the QP as opposition.

**ABGARYAN:** It will be an interesting situation. The second largest party will rule. The largest party will become an opposition. No worries though, because the Council only makes decisions on non-political issues. They are about administrative decisions. Obviously, Marutyan and our team will have to ensure that other parties support his proposed plans. 

We must never forget that we only have an advantage of a single seat, however. That's dangerous. I've never seen a Council session where every member is present for a vote. People miss a vote because they get sick, they are on a trip etc. Avinyan would have a similar problem if he were in our place. How are you supposed to pass the municipal budget like this? Sadly, I predict a governing crisis. This was not the ideal outcome.

**QUESTION:** In exchange for votes, the former regime wants Marutyan to help remove Pashinyan from power. Do you support this?

**ABGARYAN:** If Marutyan becomes the mayor of Yerevan, obviously he will be interested in changing the central government in Armenia and remove Pashinyan who is unfriendly to him.

9/20/2022,"Dear Armenians,","I am a Kurdish Turk, born and raised in America, and I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep at night without making this message.

I stand with Armenia, I always have. I was blessed with the opportunity to live somewhere other than Turkey. This is one of the only ways you can be a Turk that isn't indoctrinated by their relentless nationalist propaganda.

Your resilience is awe-inspiring, your bravery and hope set an example for not just me, but the world. Your country and culture are beautiful, your language is one I wish to study and master. Armenians are truly some of the strongest people I know. I can only hope that more people open their eyes and see just how unique and captivating Armenia is.

I have lost all hope in my people. The pain and disappointment I feel when I see them act out of ignorance and vitriol, refusing to listen to reason, is indescribable. No matter how hard I try, the fact of the matter is that they will never understand.

This is why I want you all to know that there is a small minority of Turks like me who support Armenians wholly. I want you all to know that you are never alone. Whether it be other countries that are your allies or the small percentage of Turks who pray and root for you, we are always cheering you on.

God bless you all, stay strong. You are my role models."

##Azerbaijan is an unreliable partner, Europe should stop buying its natural gas: head of European Parliament Roberta Metsola

[article,](https://arka.am/en/news/politics/head_of_european_parliament_calls_baku_an_unreliable_partner_saying_europe_should_stop_buying_its_na/)



##Azerbaijan's plan to double gas exports to EU at risk as talks stall: Bloomberg 

>Azerbaijan may not be able to deliver on ambitions to double natural gas exports to Europe by 2027, having failed to secure long-term sales deals it needs before investing billions of dollars to boost production, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

AZ-EU talks began after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the EU's energy crisis has since eased and they aren't as desperate anymore. 

>time may have run out for Azerbaijan to lock in the long-term contracts it needs to underpin investments in infrastructure.

Unlike pipeline transfers, liquified natural gas (LNG) does not require decades-long contracts and its infrastructure is flexible. The EU will buy LNG from the U.S. and Qatar.

>the market is expected to see a buildup of an oversupply in global LNG markets from 2027 and onwards

Romania said it will not sign a long-term contract. Germany has not yet held any serious talks with Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijani gas industry official says they might not be able to meet the target of supplying the additional 10 bcm to Europa by 2027. 

>Azerbaijan’s recent seizure of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which led about 100,000 Armenians to flee to Armenia amid fears of ethnic cleansing, could weigh on any decisions European buyers make. 

An American analyst believes Azerbaijan ""has shot itself in the foot"" with the invasion, and that Azeri gas will remain in Azerbaijan unless Turkey wants to buy more.

##interview with Nagorno-Karabakh opposition leader Samvel Babayan 

Read Babayan's [September 26](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16t0inm/samvel_babayan_azerbaijan_had_agreed_to_autonomy/) interview for context. He revealed details from the not-so-secret negotiations he was holding with Azerbaijan with the permission of President Arayik, against the wishes of the former regime that would later oust Arayik. Babayan was the first high-profile Nagorno-Karabakh official who crossed into Armenia without getting arrested. He said the Azerbaijan agents weren't thoroughly checking the passports during the mass exodus. The opposition parties in Armenia accused Babayan of complicating the departure of other Nagorno-Karabakh officials, citing more thorough identification procedures at the checkpoint a day after Babayan's crossing.

**REPORTER:** [Brings up Babayan's safe passage through the checkpoint]

**BABAYAN:** You can end the conspiracy theories by requesting Azerbaijan to share the video footage from the checkpoint to see how exactly I crossed it. I drove there, greeted the Azeri agents, got scanned, and entered Armenia. My impression is that the agents did not recognize me and weren't expecting me to be there. Over 20 generals crossed the same way as I did.

**REPORTER:** There are no Armenians left in Nagorno-Karabakh, yet we don't see Azeris [civilians] in Nagorno-Karabakh, either. They have invaded everything, so what are they waiting for? 

**BABAYAN:** Azerbaijan will refrain from making any moves for 2 months to ""allow the Nagorno-Karabakh population to return"", according to them. The question is, if Armenians return, will they be forced to ""reintegrate"", or will we receive some kind of autonomous status? The latter was my proposal. There were negotiations. The documents have been handed over to authorities as part of a general investigation. You will eventually see them.

But we should focus on the situation today. We must continue these negotiations with Azerbaijan to allow Armenians to have an autonomous republic within the NKAO borders. Without this, it would be pointless to try to return. People will regret it if they return without a status. 

It is true that Azerbaijan has assigned a commandant to oversee the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Their goal is to convince a few thousand Armenians to return so they'll avoid being accused of ethnic cleansing. Today there are no more than 33 Armenians left. 

There are also efforts in Armenia to return some refugees to Nagorno-Karabakh. I don't know who these people are, whether they are Russian agents or someone else, but they are attempting to convince some of the refugees to return by promising that Russian peacekeepers will remain in the region for many years and ""it will be safe"".

**REPORTER:** One must be a kamikaze to agree to return under these conditions.

**BABAYAN:** You can always find people who are easily convinced, who are perhaps elderly and get tired easily and want to return to old life. I advise them to be careful.

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan could have easily repopulated the invaded areas by bussing in thousands of people. Why haven't they done so yet?  

**BABAYAN:** There is international pressure to create conditions to allow Armenians to return. Aliyev's adviser has revealed that Azerbaijan will refrain from any actions in Nagorno-Karabakh over the next 2 months because they want Armenians to return. Azerbaijan will try to use these 2 months to strengthen its diplomatic positions.

**REPORTER:** What is your vision for returning the refugees to their homes?

**BABAYAN:** The same thing that I was negotiating with Azerbaijan. We were in the midst of negotiations [when the invasion took place]. The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army has been dissolved so that issue is no longer on the table. We should continue to negotiate around the other issues. 

**REPORTER:** Will the Nagorno-Karabakh population trust you?

**BABAYAN:** The real question is, will the negotiation lead to the return of the population? People want someone to successfully negotiate for their safe return. We are holding talks with various circles from Nagorno-Karabakh regarding our negotiations with Azerbaijan so that no one will claim it's an obscure process, but I will not ask for anyone's ""permission"" to hold these negotiations. I can do so as the #2 political party of Nagorno-Karabakh.

**REPORTER:** It's not clear anymore who the leader of Nagorno-Karabakh is after Shahramanyan's decree to dissolve the state.

**BABAYAN:** He did not have the legal right to sign that document. He can't annul a referendum by a stroke of a pen.

**REPORTER:** How were President Shahramanyan and the 22 MPs who voted for him able to safely leave Nagorno-Karabakh, after the arrest of others? Did he sign the decree in exchange for saving his own skin? 

**BABAYAN:** The decree was the ransom payment. I'm cooperating with investigators in Armenia by sharing my knowledge. The other leaders should be invited to testify. Shahramanyan signed a ceasefire agreement that claimed the army of the Republic of Armenia was in Nagorno-Karabakh, which isn't true. Armenian authorities must investigate this.

The regime in Nagorno-Karabakh has long over-relied on ""phone calls from Moscow"" to solve the problems. This is why we've lost our country. I've been warning my fellow Karabakhis since 2016 that they will become refugees soon because of the actions of the thieves in charge. 

**REPORTER:** There are reports that the 3 ex-presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh were arrested by Azerbaijan in the military base belonging to Russian peacekeepers in Ivanyan. They hoped until the end to reach Armenia safely. Why did they end up getting arrested?

**BABAYAN:** According to the information I have, they weren't arrested at the Russian military base in Ivanyan. One of them was arrested in Stepanakert's wine factory [ehh?], and the others on the road. Yes, they had received promises [by Russian peacekeepers] about being safely evacuated. But they should have known better that it wouldn't work. The wife of Volkov [the head of Russian peacekeepers] was searched by Azeris every time the Russian helicopter would land in Nagorno-Karabakh. The ex-leaders should have realized that [Russians couldn't help them reach Armenia]. Why would Russia take a risk if you are disposable for them, you are one of their many agents.

**REPORTER:** Armenia sent tens of millions of dollars to support Nagorno-Karabakh residents under the blockade. The private sector was destroyed but the public workers continued to receive salaries with the help of Armenia's subsidies. People had money but didn't have a place where they could spend it. A lot of money was sent to Nagorno-Karabakh over the past few years. Where did it all go?

**BABAYAN:** Nagorno-Karabakh (pop. 120,000) had a public sector with a whopping 25,000 employees. Plus the army and territorial defense forces. I have long accused Pashinyan of enabling the regime in Stepanakert by showering them with cash. He gave drugs to an addict. The greedy regime in Stepanakert ended up causing the situation we are in today. You and I should not speculate where the money went to. Let the authorities investigate. But yes, the schemes worked until the last day.

I've been in touch with mayors of villages and towns. I have advised Pashinyan on how to handle the refugee influx, how to help people integrate, to prevent them from becoming diasporans. We made that mistake with the Armenians who escaped Sumgayit and Baku. Can't do that again.

##interview with analyst Karen Sargsyan || Banning Russian TV channels || Russia-Armenia relations || Geopolitics

**REPORTER:** [Ruling party members] recently mentioned the possibility of prohibiting the broadcasting of Russian state media in Armenia [for spreading propaganda against Armenia's sovereignty]. As it turns out, Armenian households have access to more Russian television channels than Armenian, in our own broadcasting multiplex. Moreover, Russian channels are the only foreign ones. We have fewer Armenian channels, zero English-language channels, and a large number of Russian channels. What is the effect on Armenia and our society?

**KAREN:** That's because we have a cowardly government that allows this to continue. Moreover, the H1 public network never invites Ukrainian officials for an interview, but there is no shortage of Russian officials. The network is run by a pro-Russian sect. 

One of the members of the sect is the director of No. 36 school, who recently summoned the teachers and told them ""We must collectively go lick Russian boots because we wouldn't exist without them."" That's a copy of Margarita Simonyan's social media posts. This is a clinical case that warrants a medical examination.

Authorities say they can't shut down Russian channels because they can't touch the commercial sector. That's just an excuse, there are easy ways to restrict the channels: Require Armenian ISPs to pay ֏700M per week per subscriber for broadcasting a Russian channel.

But that wouldn't be enough. They must summon the heads of every government office and give them 3 hours to block internet access to IP addresses belonging to Russian tech giants like mail ru, Yandex, Rambler, and Vkontakte. Block them all. There are criminal idiots in the government who email top-secret documents to each other through mail ru.

They met Zelenskty 1.5 years late, they ratified the Rome Statute 9 months late, so are they going to delay the banning of Russian channels by another year now? Why?

No more than 20% of our population uses the free-to-air public multiplex to watch Russian channels. Everyone else has internet [cable]. That 20%, most of whom are low-income residents in rural areas, don't watch Russian-language channels that much. So the main problem that spreads Russian propaganda isn't the free-to-air, it's the cable. When you buy a package with 100+ channels it comes with Russian channels by default. You have 14 channels that broadcast Russian soap operas, lots of Russian cartoon networks with Russian ads, etc.. This is the domain that pushes the Kremlin propaganda. Thankfully, the authorities have found the courage to at least bring this issue to the surface. 

**REPORTER:** Why are the Russian channels dangerous?

**KAREN:** When the first wave of Russian relocants moved to Armenia after the launch of the Ukraine war, some of them subscribed to cable channels and told me that there is more Kremlin propaganda in Armenia than in Russia. They were shocked. This is also a bad look in front of Europe. To describe the current state of our media, it's like a father feeding bread to his kid while both of them sit in a pile of shit in a barn.

**REPORTER:** Russian channels have become anti-Armenian.

**KAREN:** Their Telegram, too. Ideally, we'd have more Armenian-language content so they would push the Russian channels out, but in the short term, banning is the only option.

Why do we even have a school named after [Russian poet] Pushkin? Shut it down and transfer Pushkin's statue straight to a landfill. What has Pushkin done for Armenia? The same about Chekhov. 
We have an Armenian-Russian Slavonic University. Remove ""Russian"". Make it a general university associated with Slavic countries. Invite Poles and Slovaks to co-manage it.

I graduated from a school that was later named after [Soviet physisit] Sakharov after his death. It was very well funded by the Soviet regime back in my days. It was considered as one of the best in Armenia. The Soviet regime always made sure to properly fund Russian schools in Armenia. This was a known thing. They even built an underground passage near the Chekhov school. How many Armenian schools can you name on Baghramyan Avenue [prestigious area]? Russian schools were considered elite. Bolsheviks were taking their kids to Russian schools.   

**REPORTER:** About the quality of teachers and schools today...

**KAREN:** Awful. Sadly, we must rebuild our educational system from the ground up. Three mandatory languages: Armenian, English, and French. It must be based on a Western model: Swiss, Finnish, or British. 

I'm sure someone will lecture me on how great the Soviet schools were for math and physics. The reality is that the students and their parents of these elite phys-math schools could not have been smart because they believed in nonsense. The population of the USSR was hooked on Anatoly Kashpirovsky's psychic bullshit. People would place a bucket of water in front of their TV and tune in to Kashpirovsky's psychic session so the water would receive ""energy"". A person who is supposedly good at physics would never do or believe anything like this. The so-called ""good at physics"" was on surface-level only, or did not exist at all. You are not good at physics if you place a bottle of water in front of the TV and expect some monkey from Moscow's Ostankino Tower to remotely send energy to it. You are just an ordinary moron. Have you ever seen a homeless person on the streets who graduated from Harvard? You haven't, because in a normal society, you never fall below a certain level if you graduate from, let's say, a college or a university. There is a minimum threshold. But in ex-USSR republics, you can find many hobos with good diplomas. 

**REPORTER:** About the AM-AZ border delimitation and trade routes.

**KAREN:** Azerbaijan and Russia don't want Turkey to lift the blockade on Armenia. We shouldn't give Azerbaijan any routes to Nakhijevan until the AM-AZ border delimitation is over. Or, we could give them a route via Ijevan, whichever brings the most benefits to us. 

The Armenian government wants to use 1975 Soviet maps to demarcate the AM-AZ borders. The problem is that these maps were created with the use of highly inaccurate geolocation technologies. If you take that map and stand on a location mentioned on that map, your GPS could show that you're 400 meters off. These maps were created with the use of Baltika-42 or Kronshtadt-42 systems that are inaccurate on high altitudes. It was calibrated for use at a Baltic Sea level, or the Gulf of Finland. It's highly inaccurate. 

There is no shortage of degenerates in our military who want to use that. Even Russia has given up on that tech and they don't trust their own maps drawn with that technology. Arshak Karapetyan, the idiot who served as the defense minister for 6 months before being fired by Pashinyan, who is now releasing pro-Russian videos from Moscow, is the one who convinced Pashinyan to use the inaccurate 1975 maps. Have they actually *seen* the 1975 maps? Why not maps from earlier years?

**REPORTER:** Today, everyone and their uncle are discussing these maps, the 29,800 km^2, and the enclaves. Are the enclaves in or out? This is what the population is focused on today.

**KAREN:** People should focus on washing their hands before leaving the toilet instead of enclaves. People aren't paying attention to their children's grades and do not help them with homework because parents themselves have forgotten 4th-grade math. That's what they should do, not discuss enclaves. Can people even tell the difference between an enclave and an exclave? Why do they care? 

**REPORTER:** Why is everyone focused on enclaves?

**KAREN:** Because the degenerates called ""opposition parties"", and several degenerate government members, want to divert the attention from real issues that impact the population, such as the economy, currency exchange, education, etc. These are the things that have an actual impact on the ordinary Armenians, not the ""enclaves"". 

Armenia will not have peace for as long as Russia exists in its current form. The first thing an Armenian must do in the morning is to read two prayers: one for Zelensky and one for Ukraine to win the war *as soon as possible*. Pashinyan can speak about an era of peace and sign 10 peace agreements every day, but none of it will be worth anything as long as Aliyev has the backing of Putin.

##Armenian and German scientists have been busy collecting data from Lake Sevan over the past few years 

Armenian scientists make regular visits to Germany to study European methods. The AM-DE joint research group has collected data from Sevan over the past 3 years. They have concluded the project. The collected data has allowed them to create various models. 

Lake Sevan has lost a significant portion of its ""cold"" layer due to the gradual decrease in water levels throughout the decades. One of the models allows scientists to predict what would happen if the water levels were to rise again, and how long it would take to restore the cold protective layer.

The plankton population was one of the targets of the research. Planktons respond quickly to changes in the quality of water and ""food"" ecosystem. They are a great metric.

Hydro-ecology stations were installed in the lake to continuously monitor the water quality.

German scientists provided modern instruments for studying problems in various layers of the lake. The project was co-funded by the German government.

Every time someone suggests something, some people are always gonna say, that it's not enough, bla bla bla. I've had enough of this shit, stop doing it.

2/25/2022,Right now the behaviour of the west towards Turkey the last few years makes even less sense,"So, basically the west sanctioned Turkey over shit like invasions into Syria to protect Turkey from YPG/PKK terror that has plagued the country for dozens of years. They made Turkey's enemies the darlings of their people with their shitty propaganda media. They invaded Syria or propped up proxies and dragged Turkey along, only to leave later and left Turkey to defend Idlib to stop the flow of even more refugees. They made Turkey keep millions of Syrians in Turkey, and then painted Turkey as the bad guy anyway. They supported Greece with their expansionist EEZ policies and painted Turkey as the bad guy again on their shitty propaganda media. They sanctioned Turkey and heavily weakened Turkey's economy and military by refusing Patriots and F-35, also the 40 F-16s Turkey wanted instead. For what? Armenians and Kurds? That useless bunch? The Armenians that have historically always been on Russia's side? The Kurds who have also hurt western people in Europe and Turkey with their terrorism? The Greeks, who are currently opposing certain sanctions against their orthodox Russian brothers? Of the French who partnered up with Russia, along with Greece, in Libya?

And now with this Russian invasion, I hope it's finally clear for those dumbasses that you DON'T WEAKEN YOUR OWN NATO ALLY WHO IS LITERALLY PART OF YOUR EASTERN FLANK AND THE ONLY NATION THAT CAN AT LEAST PUT UP A FIGHT AGAINST RUSSIA IF NEEDED!

Seriously, they weakened Turkey so badly, that Turkey turned towards RUSSIA for anti air weaponry. Even for fighter jets, as Turkey seriously was and is considering Sukhoi's instead of western jets. Now, Turkey is losing its most important engine supplier for drones and jets. What is the west going to do now? Keep going with sanctions and weakening Turkey, or finally realising they need Turkey more than a bunch of cousin raping PKK terrorists and some Armo votes in California?

What Turkey should do currently, is nothing. If NATO doesn't do anything, neither should Turkey. Keep the Bosphorus open, why would we do anything if the rest is just going to do nothing? They either learn to keep their NATO ally close, or have a completely passive isolationist NATO ally who doesn't give a shit about them or anyone else, just like they have done to Turkey for years now.

Let the PKK/YPG/SDF and Armenia stop Russia now then. I'm sure their friendship and partnership with the west is so strong, they'll solve this and future problems with Russia. Or, the west can start supplying some fucking weapons to Turkey. Build up the Turkish Airforce. Give them Eurofighters, F-16s, F-15s, F-35A and B for the new carriers Turkey is building, drone engines, jet engines for the TAI TFX, Patriots, EW gear, etc. Build up the Turkish Air Force up to around 500/600 fixed wing fighters, more attack helicopters, some kick ass air defence, etc. And then maybe, one day, Turkey might be willing to bleed for NATO and non-NATO allies. Until then, send the PKK and Armenians and Greeks to fight for you and defend NATO (lol)."

2/6/2017,The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict: The Unfortunate Role Of Propaganda,"As is sadly true of many wars, there are special interests supporting the instigators of this Nagorno-Karabakh war. Far from the frontlines and the gunfire, these interests effectuate advocacy campaigns of misconception and disinformation — working tirelessly to control global narratives and limit reactions to the truth. Lost in the noise are an illegal military occupation and ethnic cleansing implemented by Armenia against Azerbaijan.

One of the more troubling and unfortunately effective narratives is based on the religious identity of the two nations. The propagandists purposefully present it as a conflict ""between Christian Armenia and Muslim Azerbaijan."" Despite Azerbaijan's longstanding identity as a champion of multi-faith harmony, we don't live in a world where the specifics always matter. A lack of public knowledge and the triggering impact of fear and otherwise straightforward Islamophobia have allowed this message to effectively perpetuate brutal violence against Azerbaijan — a longstanding ally to the U.S. and the State of Israel; a safe and welcoming home to Christian and Jewish communities for centuries.

Azerbaijan is a secular republic, globally celebrated as a successful model for multi-faith and multicultural engagement. It is also an international champion, alongside the U.S. and other allies, in the fight against terrorism and extremism. Over 30,000 Armenian Christians live peacefully in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, which boasts a grand Armenian Church — completely renovated and perfectly preserved by the Azerbaijani Government. Nationwide, around 500,000 Christians of various denominations and 30,000 Jews live peacefully alongside a majority Muslim population.

Another commonly employed myth revolves around the ""true"" historical belonging of the Karabakh region. If facts matter at all, it's important to note that the last independent state in the region in question was the Azerbaijani-run Karabakh Khanate (1747-1805). When the Karabakh Khanate was taken over by the Russian Empire, Armenians constituted only around 8 percent of the region's population, and ethnic Azerbaijanis comprised over 90 percent. In the ensuing decades, the massive resettlement of Armenians to Karabakh from the Middle East increased their presence, as indigenous Azerbaijanis were expelled.

In January 1920, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR), the first secular democracy in the Muslim world, was de facto recognized by the Allied Powers, with the Nagorno-Karabakh region within its borders. In April 1920, the ADR was invaded by the Soviets. Thus Azerbaijan was incorporated into the Soviet Union with Nagorno-Karabakh as its integral part. In 1921, the so-called Caucasian Bureau passed a [decision](http://www.usazeris.org/integrity/kavburo.pdf) ""to keep Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan.""

Another very disturbing storyline that has been perpetuated by the lobbyists and military leaders eager to shift the blame, is that it was Nagorno-Karabakh ""self-defense forces"" that have fought against Azerbaijan and are ""in control"" of the occupied territory, not the armed forces of Armenia. In 2015, [the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=002-10619) that 

>the Republic of Armenia, through its military presence and the provision of military equipment and expertise, has been significantly involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict from an early date.

>This military support has been – and continues to be – decisive for the conquest of and continued control over the territories in issue.

ECHR cited [four 1993 U.N. Security Council resolutions](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424012611/http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) condemning the occupation of Azerbaijan's territories and demanding the immediate withdrawal of Armenian forces from the occupied areas.

The Court [noted](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=002-10619): 

>It is hardly conceivable that Nagorno-Karabakh – an entity with a population of fewer than 150,000 ethnic Armenians – was able, without the substantial military support of Armenia, to set up a defense force in early 1992 that, against the country of Azerbaijan with approximately seven million people, not only established control of the former NKAO but also, before the end of 1993, conquered the whole or major parts of seven surrounding Azerbaijani districts.

The ECHR decision also conclusively refuted the myths regarding the so-called ""independence"" of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has never been recognized by any country and [is internationally regarded as part of Azerbaijan](http://www.un.org/press/en/2008/ga10693.doc.htm). 

The Court [stated](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=002-10619): 

>All of the above reveals that the Republic of Armenia, from the early days of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, has had a significant and decisive influence over the ""NKR"", that the two entities are highly integrated in virtually all important matters and that this situation persists to this day. In other words, the ""NKR"" and its administration survives by virtue of the military, political, financial and other support given to it by Armenia which, consequently, exercises effective control over Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories.

Without academic and historical context or significant knowledge of the region and the surrounding issues at play, it isn't surprising that some are confused about the turmoil in Karabakh, especially considering the powerful forces working to keep public perception far removed from the truth. However the risks of violent warfare are unambiguous, and it is critical to set the record straight. As the global community struggles with international terror, uncertain economic times and growing unrest in the Middle East, sorting out fact from fiction is essential as we look toward addressing the difficult issues posed by this conflict and numerous others around the globe.

I am using a throwaway account to protect myself as i don't want to be harassed by azeri/turkish nationalists, but if anyone is skeptical, i can prove my ""Turkishness"" to the mods of this sub. Before starting off, I want to clarify one thing. I was never a nationalist, and I've always recognized the Armenian Genocide, as I'm from a very left-wing family. However at the start of the conflict, I was almost drawn to the Azerbaijani/Turkish narrative, but some critical thinking prevented me from ever taking it seriously. So what i realized was 1- Majority of Artsakh is Armenian, and so, if it was ruled by Azerbaijan, the majority of the region couldn't rule themselves, and it would be an apartheid.

2- What Armenia did was the same as what we did in Northern Cyprus.

3- If Armenia should give Artsakh to Azerbaijan because at a certain point in time, majority of it was Azeri (according to azeri sources), that would mean that we should give our west coast to Greece as majority of the region was once Greek.

Furthermore, having friends from Armenia online, I got to hear their perspective, and i was made aware that Azerbaijan was committing atrocities too, despite never hearing about it on the news. I learned about Operation Ring and the Baku pogroms, and many other Azerbaijani atrocities that they tried to hide from me. I won't say that I support Armenia yet as I'm not informed well enough about the situation, but I definitely don't support Azerbaijan. So I want to learn about the truth, not the Azeri propaganda I see on TV."

##Flashback 1918: How Armenian diplomats negotiated with the organizers of the 1915 genocide and almost cut a deal to expand Armenia 

It's June 1918. Armenia sent a delegation to Istanbul to try to amend the humiliating Treaty of Batum. This process was even more humiliating because they had to negotiate with the organizers of the Genocide: The Ottoman leaders Enver, Talât, and Cemal.

Ottomans had invited the 3 republics of Caucasus, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria to together discuss various issues including the conflicts between the Caucasus republics.

Armenia believed that Germany wanted to review the Batum Treaty according to the Brest-Litovsk provisions. Over the next 4 months, the Armenian delegation tried to gain the territories of Akhalkalak, Lori, Syunik, Karabakh, and Nakhijevan. It was a competition between the 3 republics. 

Ottomans were against giving Syunik and Karabakh to Armenia because they wanted to maintain direct access to Azerbaijan through the south. Similarly, they were against giving Akhalkalak and Lori to Armenia because they wanted a road towards Gandzak [today Ganja, Azerbaijan] through the north.

The diplomats from Azerbaijan and Georgia wanted lands that were part of Armenia. Each party wanted the most. This led to diplomatic clashes.

After waiting for 4 months, the big conference did not take place because Ottomans and Germans got their butts kicked on the battlefield. There were instead individual meetings with the Ottoman and other officials. 

Talât Pasha, one of the figures responsible for the genocide, lamented the ""misfortune that had befallen the Armenians"". He blamed the Kurds, local officials, and the military for the killings. The Armenian delegation swallowed the humiliation and thanked him for eventually agreeing to allow the formation of the Armenian Republic. 

Armenian delegation requested a meeting with Talât concerning the September 1918 massacres of Armenians in Baku. They asked Talât to order the Turkish army not to attack Karabakh. Talât called Enver and informed him that Armenians were requesting Karabakh not to be attacked. Talât then told the Armenian delegation that there would be no attack. The Armenian delegation met Enver and received the same reassurance. 

A month later, Enver invited the Armenian delegation to meet the Sultan. The delegation expressed hope that, from now on, independent Armenia and Turkey would be good neighbors. The Sultan was delighted that Armenians and Turks would finally have politically friendly relations. He sent greetings to the Armenian nation.

Enver invited the Armenian delegation to his house for dinner. The residence was covered in gold, silk, carpets, and all sorts of expensive junk. Also invited were delegations from Germany, Georgia, and Azerbaijan to discuss the Caucasian republics.

Armenia suggested splitting the Transcaucasus region as such: 38% to Armenia, 33% to Georgia, 29% to Azerbaijan. The other two republics rejected it.

The Armenian delegation spoke with Izzet Pasha, the Grand Vizier of the new cabinet, to discuss the withdrawal of the Ottoman army to the borders under the Brest-Litovsk. They accepted it. Moreover, they promised to help return all Armenian refugees and resolve their problems within 1 month. The Armenian delegation wanted to establish good relations with the Ottoman government to prevent negative intentions. 

Enver informed Armenians that Turkey would champion Armenia's rights to Lori-Pambak, and that he was confident that a satisfactory arrangement could be worked out with Azerbaijan. It was even possible that the boundaries of Armenia might be extended to the shores of the Akhurian River.

After Talât returned from Berlin, he made even more promises to Armenia, realizing how vulnerable the Ottomans were due to defeats on the battlefields. At the end of September, Talât announced that his government would grant Armenia concessions even greater than those sought by the Armenian delegation.

Those were Talât's last official words. The Ottoman Empire capitulated to the Allies a few days later. 

Rauf Bey, the Ottoman delegate tasked with signing a ceasefire with Britain, requested Armenia to send a delegate to the signing ceremony to show the British that the Ottomans and Armenians had reconciled. This is basically what happened next: 

**Armenia:** You've been a hardass all this time, Rauf Bey. Can you tell me what our borders will look like after your defeat?

**Rauf Bey:** The 1914 borders, amended at the cost of the Alashkert valley.

**Armenia:** We reject your offer and we will not send a delegate. The Allies have won and our hopes rely on their victory now.

##rallies are banned in Nagorno-Karabakh due to martial law

Gen. Samvel Babayan had planned to hold a major rally on Friday, ahead of the Saturday parliamentary vote to elect a new president. He wants the public to stop the appointment of a figure ""who will make the crisis worse"". He accused Russia of helping orchestrate the power change in Nagorno-Karabakh and not helping to resolve the conflict expediently. Some analysts are concerned that Arayik's resignation could further destabilize the internal situation and the NK-AZ borders. Details in [Thursday](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16csxuq/gen_samvel_babayans_interview_assassination/) report. 

**Nagorno-Karabakh Government:** Rallies are banned under the ongoing martial law. The participants will face legal consequences. Avoid provocations. //

The parliament is split into two camps. The majority, backed by the former regime, wants to appoint a person nominated by the former regime. The second camp is Samvel Babayan, whose party is the second largest party in parliament but falls short of enough votes to elect Babayan.

Babayan's party was not allowed to nominate Babayan for president, raising the ire of Babayan supporters. That decision was later reversed.

##Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Zakharova vents about unfair criticism and ""mud throwing"" during an Armenian-Russian media forum held in Yerevan

**ZAKHAROVA:** We are brotherly nations with a long record of cooperation. Thanks to the personal efforts of President Vladimir Putin, the 2020 war was stopped and the Nov. 9 Statement was signed, becoming a strong basis for establishing peace and normalization of relations in the region. 

Russia is Armenia's largest economic partner. We invest 40% of all capital investments amounting to $2.2 billion. We give steep discount on gas. Our railway company handles passenger and railway traffic in Armenia.

Starting in 2010, Russia has sent $70 million in humanitarian aid to Armenia via the UN.

Russian universities are educating 5,200 Armenian students, 1,800 of whom receive state subsidies from Russia. 

Our border guards help protect Armenia's borders with Turkey, Iran, and Azerbaijan.

To preserve all this, it's necessary to maintain healthy AM-RU relations. It's on the shoulders of governments and mass media. It's necessary to highlight the positives and remember the heroic accomplishments of our nations in the past.

Unfortunately, there has been a trend in Armenian media lately to circulate negative and often false information about Russia. It's against the traditionally friendly relations. //

Maria Zakharova went on to justify Russia's inaction around the Nagorno-Karabakh blockade and the invasion of Armenia proper, and criticized Armenia's decision to ban the entry of certain Russian officials and media figures like Margo.

**ZAKHAROVA:** We were shocked to hear the news about the arrest of a Sputnik reporter [Russia's state media] and the blogger Mika Badalyan [pro-Russian activist from Armenia]. //

Why were the bloggers arrested and released? Seven people were arrested in Syunik yesterday, including blogger Mika Badalyan and a Sputnik employee. They are facing charges relating to the illegal acquisition, storage, and transfer of weapons. The authorities found Kalashnikov rifles, grenades, and marijuana during the raid. The investigation began on August 24th. 

Blogger Mika Badalyan's wife (Russian) is accused of filming the location and movement of Armenian soldiers near a border town yesterday, despite numerous warnings by the army that doing so is a danger to security. The video was circulated by the Azerbaijani press.

**ZAKHAROVA:** The West does not want to protect Armenia, they just want to drive Russia out of Armenia. We are concerned about the rise of pro-Western media outlets in Armenia whose intention is to discredit Russia and AM-RU relations. There is a lot of mud-throwing instead of constructive criticism. The West promotes and finances these outlets through financial grants. //

**DMITRI PISARENKO (Sputnik's Armenia branch):** The Russian press should pay more attention to Armenia. There is a deficit of information that needs to be filled. The Russian TV channels need to cover more news about Armenia and present it to the audience based in Armenia.

##interview with analyst Karen Sargsyan 

**REPORTER:** Ukraine invited Pashinyan's wife Anna Hakobyan to [visit Kyiv](https://youtu.be/ZRVKD_h7dl8?t=1) and take part in the forum. Why now?

**KAREN:** They have always invited, and they have always requested Armenia for humanitarian assistance, but Armenia rejected it in the past. The government no longer has the option to hide its disappointment in Russia. They have finally realized that not leaving the Russian camp and instead playing complementarism is not bringing any benefits. 

The decision to donate thousands of tablets and phones to Ukraine was the right choice because Ukrainian kids have been forced to attend school remotely. This is better than sending medicine.

I knew about Hakobyan's planned trip since July. It was a long diplomatic process. 

**REPORTER:** How did Ukraine respond to her participation?

**KAREN:** Wonderfully. They sat her next to Anthony Blinken, the main VIP guest. They don't assign the seats randomly. Hakobyan's visit was the main newsmaker in the Ukrainian press. 

This is important because Azerbaijan has long been trying to portray Armenia as Russia's ally, and that only Azerbaijan was sending aid to Ukraine. Azerbaijan no longer has that card in its hand.

Azerbaijan was spending millions of dollars each month on anti-Armenian propaganda to deceive Ukraine. This week their efforts were met with a series of headlines: Armenia-US joint military exercises, Armenia recalls ambassador to CSTO, Anna Hakobyan delivers aid to Ukraine, Anna Hakobyan uses the word ""war"" and not ""special operation"", and the Armenian media sphere being flooded by anti-Russian rhetoric. This was a moral boost for Ukraine because they interpreted this as Russia getting weaker and losing its remaining friends. For them it's important that this is about Armenia and not another CSTO member.

**REPORTER:** That's what I've observed in the Ukrainian media as well. Anything about Armenia resonated far wider and faster. Why is *""tiny Armenia""* so important in this context? 

**KAREN:** Armenia's self-worth was intentionally destroyed by the Russian empire, aided by pro-Russian forces like Levon Ter-Petrosyan and ARF. Armenia was an extremely important player for the UK and France because we were controlling the flow of Western capital in the regions east of Constantinople. 

Ukraine doesn't view Armenia as tiny and unimportant. Armenians have played a significant role in Ukraine's history. Since the days of the foundation of their statehood, when there were small domains scattered around, Armenians made their contribution. There are Armenian churches in Ukraine dating back to the 13th century.

**REPORTER:** Who circulated the claim that Ukraine had supplied the white phosphorus weapons used by Azerbaijan during the 2020 war?

**KAREN:** The entire story is completely made up. No one has ever brought any evidence of any of that. There is also no evidence of chemical phosphorus being used during the 2020 war. If there is evidence of that, and Armenia hasn't bothered to send the evidence to the relevant international agencies, then someone must be tried for treason.

What we saw in videos during the 2020 war was Azerbaijan using the 120mm GRAD's 9m22s munitions. They contain thermite, not white phosphorus. It's used for burning down large areas. The thermite burns at 2,000 degrees and cannot be extinguished with water. It will burn through your skin and reach your bone, but it's not white phosphorus.

The claim that Ukraine sold white phosphorus to Azerbaijan was first made by Russian media figure WarGonzo or his colleagues. Today we all know he is just a propagandist. 

That bastard Sarik Andreasyan [a very famous Russian movie director with Armenian origins] circulated WarGonzo's rumors. The news reached Ukraine's President Zelensky who personally responded to Sarik.

**REPORTER:** How did Zelensky respond?

**KAREN:** *Are you an idiot? We didn't sell white phosphorus.* In the meantime, Arsen Avakov [ethnic Armenian], who was the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine responsible for customs and transfers, also refuted the claim. If you remember, Avakov restrained several Ukrainian parliament MPs who made [presumably anti-Armenian comments] at the start of the war. 

Ukraine has used everything in its arsenal against Russia so far. I'm sure they would have used white phosphorus if they possessed any.

White phosphorus is extremely dangerous and requires special attention. Only special chemically-trained troops can use them.

Anyone who claims Ukraine sold white phosphorus to Azerbaijan that was then used against Armenians is either 1) An idiot who fell for Russian propaganda, 2) A Russian agent tasked with damaging AM-UA relations. 

**REPORTER:** Lately we've seen reports of the accumulation of troops on the NK-AZ border. Will Azerbaijan launch the full invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh?

**KAREN:** I don't think so. Doing that would mean the removal of Russian soldiers. I doubt Azerbaijan will want to lose Russia's friendship because they need it. As long as Aliyev is on good terms with his fellow totalitarian regimes, he will be OK at home. The moment Aliyev abandons his totalitarian friends, he becomes an easy target for the West. 

The West is essentially saying that they aren't imposing sanctions on Aliyev because they don't won't him to join the Russian camp. 

Attacking Armenia now would not be beneficial for Azerbaijan politically. It's also a risky military move because there is always a chance he could sustain territorial losses, too, especially now that Armenians on both sides are desperate to lift the blockade.
 
**REPORTER:** Will Russia leave the South Caucasus region, as stated by Pashinyan?

**KAREN:** Russia has already left. Russia reached an agreement with Azerbaijan in 2011, signed it in 2016, and implemented it in 2020. The process isn't over yet. They want to establish a corridor through Syunik.

**REPORTER:** Did Russia ""sell"" the Berdzor corridor as well?

**KAREN:** Obviously. Pashinyan revealed that Russia [pressured the Nagorno-Karabakh government to withdraw from Berdzor] without the prior knowledge of Armenia. Berdzor was sold by Russia. *[This was supposed to happen 2 years later but Russia and Azerbaijan forced the process to take place earlier]* 

Historically, has Russia done anything good for Armenia? This year we mark the 245th anniversary of the 1st Armenian Genocide. The genocide of Crimean Armenians was perpetrated by Queen Yekaterina 2nd, her lover Potemkin, and scumbag Suvorov. 
There were over 40 churches and monasteries in Feodosia [Crimea], and they survived even the Ottoman Empire, but couldn't survive the Russian Empire. Why are there only 3 left, with 2 of them having been transferred to the Russian church? 

What have the Bolsheviks done for Armenia? They were trying to conduct the first [nuclear](https://anca.org/first-atom-bomb-in-ussr-created-in-armenia-reads-cia-document/) experiment in the Hrazdan river gorge. They almost signed it. Anastas Mikoyan and a few others convinced them not to.

**REPORTER:** Alen Simonyan directly accused Russia of holding Nagorno-Karabakh residents hostage. *""The country that was supposed to defend us is the one maintaining the blockade.""*

**KAREN:** That was the most important message that needs more media attention. Instead, we are flooded with videos of 8 Azeri tanks being driven in Nakhijevan. Have you seen the mountains in that direction? What are those 8 tanks going to do there? Why was that bigger news? The war of 2020 has not even ended.

**REPORTER:** It turns out that Russian citizens residing in Yerevan will be allowed to vote in the upcoming municipal elections. There are concerns Russia will ""appoint"" their person.

**KAREN:** The law allows citizens of any country, not just Russia, to participate in these elections as long as they've resided in Yerevan for 1+ year. We're talking about 11,000 people, presumably Russian. I don't know how the average Russian person would vote without speaking the language and understanding anything about our politics. Those who vote are probably agents carrying out orders.

##update: the original source of the false report about Macron's visit to Armenia was a French website 

It was posted by ""Opinion Internationale"" and quickly removed. The outlet's director had also posted his link on Twitter, contributing to the spread of the false information.

Two days later, citing its internal ""sources"", a newly created website called Alpha News with alleged links to the Kremlin claimed that Macron was going to visit Armenia. It was picked up by pro-Russian outlets and media figures before reaching the media spheres in Azerbaijan and Russia.

8/5/2022,I have had enough of this shit #3 - Russian Propaganda,"Hi ladies and gentlemen, it's time for annoying things to be discussed. Remember that it's all subjective, and feel free to argue in the comments. In fact feel free to post about things that make you crazy. Now let's go.

 Russian propaganda is the most powerful weapon Kremlin possesses. I'm not gonna go into details of how it's working, there's already a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6Vg7yLx54) about that. What i want to talk about is how it affects us. 

First and foremost, Russia tries to align its interests with our interests. In other words Russian propaganda claims that Russia wants what Armenia wants for Armenia, Russia does what is best for Armenia. Which is simply a lie. I think the last time our interests were more or less aligned was the 1990s. After Putin came into power our paths split. 

Of course it goes without saying, that Russia is Putin. He is the only one that makes the decisions. Now, there are 2 crucial things to understand. First of all Putin doesn't do what is best for Russia, he just plays his games(bloody and atrocious). 

The second key point to understand, is that Putin has his own international relations theory. In his mind, he is the king of a global superpower, and every country surrounding him, must be his vassals. He doesn't recognize anyone as an ally, only vassals, and the rights and interests of vassals are completely neglected. Now about their propaganda. 

The Russian propaganda tries to undermine every authority in the Armenia, starting from the PM, ending with mayors of cities. Everyone according to Russian propaganda is either an idiot or դավաճան, but actually both. They try to make our authorities seem untrustworthy (with some actual help from our authorities). They try to divide our society (and actually succeed). Because if you don't agree with every single word they say, you are a traitor and Turk. They try to make us, feel helpless.

 Most of this is being done via the TV, telegram channels, social networks and their brought agents(not like James Bonds, but rather pathetic pieces of shit who are actually դավաճան).

Oh, and they are always intimidating us. According to them, the war will definitely start later today, if it didn't then it must be tomorrow, or yesterday... Oh my god.. We are doomed. We all will be slaughtered, because we cannot defend ourselves, And only The great Russia can defend us, if we are being good boys over here of course...

 It also creates hostility, and tries to put us in the same ship with Russia. Ukraine is an amazing example of this. Apart from the standard arguments they use for domestic use(nazis, anti-Russia, defend our Russians inside Ukraine, etc...), there are two arguments against Ukraine made up exclusively for us. 

First of all, they can't seem to shut the fuck up about Ukraines weapon sells to Azerbaijan. However they miss the context, and a very important fact. First of all, after the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine inherited a really huuuge soviet arsenal. Being ruled by corrupt idiots(sounds familiar?), Ukraine sold almost everything, to almost everyone. A small chunk of that(worth tens of millions) bought Azerbaijan. A small amount of that from them were also bought by... Surprise.... Armenia(also worth tens of millions, but probably less than Azeris). 

Russia also hides the fact, that the weapons Ukraine sold to Azeris, were absolutely insignificant. It also forgets to mention, that around 80(worth of $5bln+ by some estimations) percent of Azeri arsenal is bought from Russia. That's right, they are the main supplier. Apart, from the high precision weapons, every significant weapon that Azeris have, they got from Russia. They also tell us, that Ukraine sold phosphorus munitions (those were probably thermite munitions i think) to Azeris, which also has absolutely no evidence (and seems almost impossible honestly). Ukraine never had those kinds of munitions(there's no evidence and it seems unlikely). A small amount of so-called phosphorus bombs Russia inherited from the Soviet Union. Apart from Russia itself some analysts suggest that Soviet Germany had a small arsenal of those which were somehow sold to Turkey at some point, to appease them. 

The second and frankly more annoying argument for us, is the special propaganda operation carried out by Russian and Azeri propaganda forces. All those fucking signs that say ""Crimea/Donbass is Russia, Artsakh is Armenia"". It's a way for Russia to put us in the same ship(shit) with them. Two cases have nothing to do with each other, and are only meant to make us support Russian annexations. What Azeri propaganda has to do with it you ask? They have their own ""Crimea/Donbass is Ukraine, Qarabakh is Azerbaijan"". And this shit, combined with Russia's shit, works amazingly well. It makes Ukrainians support Azeris and some Armenians support Russia. 

With all this being said, i want to mention, that Ukraine and Turks(also caspian turks) are actually allies. But Ukraine was(is) in a horrible geopolitical situation and has to do everything to survive, kinda like us. Especially before the last full blown invasion, the West's support was very limited, however Turkeys support was much more significant. Now, let the politicians do whatever is necessary, to trade, to say, to give everything needed, in order  to keep their nations stay afloat. As for us, people, we shouldn't hate each other. On the contrary, we should be supportive, because we are in a very similar situation.

I understand some Armenians pain, that no one gives a fuck, when we are being bombed, but Ukraine for some reason is important to Europe/USA.  That has its reasons, which I'm not going to go into here, just remember it's not Ukrainians fault that the world does not care about us.

Also worth mentioning, that all of this has nothing to do with Russian people. We have a close cultural ties, and are generally very friendly with each other, which i believe is amazing. There is no reason to be mad at them either, because they have nothing to do with their state policy.

This was a pretty long text, and i'm not good at writing long texts, or texts, or writing... Anyway.  
I hope it deserved your attention."

https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk  --> İlgili Wikipedia sayfası, bu Wiki Quote sitesinde önemli ve tanınır insanların sözlerine yer verilir. Her önemli figürün site içinde kendisine ayrılan sayfasında toplu olarak yer alır bu sözler. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk'e de ayrılan bir sayfa ve burada sözleri var. Atatürk'ün sayfası en son 1 ay önce editlenmiş ve Atatürk'ün 'Ermenilerin bu feyizli ülkede hiçbir hakkı yoktur. Memleketiniz sizindir, Türklerindir.' sözünü sanki 1915 sözde ermeni soykırımı üzerine söylenmiş gibi lanse edip kara propaganda yayarak hem Atatürk'ü ırkçı olarak tanıtmayı amaçlamış, hem Türkler ırkçıdır stereotipini desteklemiş, hem de gelecek referanslar için 1915 olaylarının soykırım olduğuna dair sahte kanıt&veri oluşturmak istemiş. 


Bakınız Wikipedia sayfası şu şekilde editlenmiş(linkte de görebilirsiniz, burada kaynak kısmını dikkatli okuyun) --> Armenians have no rights in this prosperous country. Your country is yours, it belongs to the Turks. This country was Turkish in history, therefore it is Turkish and will live as a Turk forever.
Hâkimiyet-i Milliye, March 21, 1923. Ulgen, Fatma. Reading Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Patterns of prejudice 44.4 (2010): 369-391.


Hâlbuki bu, Adana esnaflarıyla yapılan konuşmadan cımbızlanan bir laftır. Konuşmanın bütünü, içeriğiyle ve yapıldığı dönemdeki tarihsel bağlamla ele alındığında görülecektir ki; bu sözlerin Ermeni tehciriyle hiçbir alakası yoktur ve burada iki şey kastedilmiştir. 


1) Osmanlı döneminde sanata önem verilmeyişinden ve müslüman sanatkârların desteklenmeyişinden ötürü müslüman kesim sanattan mahrum kalmış & müslüman sanatkârların sayısı azalmıştı. Bu politikanın bir sonucu olarak sanat gayri müslimlerin tekeline girmiş ve hatta gayri müslimler sanat ocaklarımızı ve memleketi sahiplenir bir duruma gelmişti. Bu, haksızlık ve küstahsızlıktı. Ne Ermeniler ne başka yabancı unsurlar Türk kültürünü, sanatını, memleketini yok sayamaz, bunlar üzerinde hak iddia edemezdi. Burada Ermeniler, gayri müslimlere ve yabancı unsurlara örnek olarak verilmiştir; özellikle Ermeni milleti hedef alınmamıştır. Bakınız konuşmadan direkt alıntılar yapıyorum 'şunlar, bunlar, Ermeniler sanat ocaklarımızı işgal etmişler' 'Memleket en sonunda yine gerçek sahiplerinin elinde karar kıldı. Ermeniler ve diğerlerinin burada hiçbir hakkı yoktur' . Yabancı unsurlara örnek olarak Ermenilerin adının geçmesi ise konuşmanın Adana'da geçiyor oluşundandır; bu cephede Fransızlara ve Ermenilere karşı savaşılmıştı. 


2) 21 Mart 1923'te yapılan bu konuşmadan 2-3 sene evvel Ermeniler, Fransızların desteğiyle bu bölgede bir devlet kurmayı amaçlamıştı. Kilikya (Cilicia) bölgesinde kurulması amaçlanan bu devlet Osmaniye, Adana, İçel ve çevre bölgelerini kapsıyordu. 20 Ekim 1921 Ankara Antlaşması ile Fransız işgali son bulmuştu. Yani bu konuşmada aynı zamanda Anadolunun Türkiye Devletine ait olduğu, Ermenilerin bu topraklarda hak iddia edemeyeceği ve burada bir Ermeni devleti kurulamayacağı vurgulanıyor. 


Görüldüğü üzere Atatürk bu sözünü ne 1915 olayları üzerine söylemiştir ne de bu sözle Türkiyeli Ermenilerin hukuksal haklarını vs. kastetmiştir. Bu nedenle böyle yanlı ve yanlış veriler kara propagandadır & vikipedi vandalizmidir.  


KAYNAK: Atatürk'ün bu ünlü sözünün geçtiği konuşmanın tamamı için --> https://www.atam.gov.tr/ataturkun-soylev-ve-demecleri/adana-esnaflariyla-konusma


EDİT: Bir kardeşimiz Wiki Quote sayfasındaki bilgi kirliliğini düzeltmiş. Ve bu cımbızlanmış ve bağlamından koparılan propaganda kaldırılmış.

EDİT 2: Birisi tekrar eski hâline getirmiş. Arkadaşlar bazen bu şekilde birkaç karşılıklı editleşmeden sonra 'vandalizmden korumak için' diye makaleler kilitlenebiliyor ve yanlış bilgi ile kalabiliyor. Şu an kilitlemeye çalıştıklarını sanmıyoruz ama yine de sözü direkt silmeyelim. Direkt silmek yerine olayın başını sonunu anlatalım discussion & talk kısmında. Benim önerilerim: 
1) 'Reading Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Patterns of prejudice' kısmına kaynak gösterilmesini veya kaldırılmasını talep edelim discussion kısmından çünkü konuşma Adanada sanatkâr esnaflarla yapılan bir konuşma, 1915 ile alakası yok. 
2) konuşmanın neyle ilgili olduğunun açıklama olarak quote altına yazılmasını talep edelim, mesela 'As quoted in Hâkimiyeti Milliye, 21 Mart 1923. Regarding the succesfull Turkish defense against Armenian-French invasions & land claims over Cilicia/Southern Anatolia and Armenians along with other foreign elements taking over and claiming rights over Ottomans-Turkeys art quarries.' gibi. Buna kaynak olarak ilk başta attığım linkteki full konuşma metnini gösterebiliriz. 
3) bence çeviri çok taraflı yapılmış, daha doğru bir çeviri için önerim: Armenians have no rights over this fertile country. The homeland belongs to you, to Turks. This homeland belonged to Turks in history, so therefore it is Turkish and it will remain Turkish forever. 
Arkadaşlar sizler de önerilerinizi yazın ve maddeyi editleyerek direkt silmek yerine discussion kısmında hepimizin sunduğu önerileri öne sürebiliriz. Böylelikle sağlıklı bir tartışma ortamında bu sorunu çözebiliriz. Benim wikipedia hesabım yok ayrıca, wikipediada daha deneyimli arkadaşlarımız bizi nasıl bir yol izlememiz gerektiği konusunda yönlendirsinler lütfen."

the AZ subreddit has seen an abnormal growth in users compared to Geo and Armenia. Please for the love of everything don’t let yourself get dragged into this shit, the Armenians are probably getting baited and triggered by Azeri trolls as well.

War is hell emotions are high we can’t start hating each other regardless of who you think is right or wrong in this conflict. We have had enough ethnic division, when the fuck will the Caucaus as a region start to heal?"

Aliyev has also released multiple statements for internal consumption saying that Armenia has no choice but to put the idea of territorial integrity aside, submit to Azeri demands and give the Syunik corridor. (yeah ironic). He made multiple statements about Artsakh being Azerbaijani territory and Azerbaijan having the right to carry out whatever operation it wants on its own territory. 

""I want to say again if a provocation like this is repeated again, the response will be harsher, they will be more sorry, they will cry for help louder. But I say again, our intention is not to start a new war. It's enough. We have achieved what we wanted.""

Multiple fake propaganda like videos are also being shared around Azeri social media channels falsifying  history and facts to paint Artsakh as Azerbaijan and even parts of Armenia as Azerbaijan.


With the Russian side too busy in Ukraine to do any sort of mediation, the French side seemingly vanished and the US side soon to focus on midterm elections, I feel that Aliyev will plan either an invasion of Armenia or start fights throughout the Syunik border to force Armenia to give him a corridor."

It is essential that a UN mission can access the territory within the next few days.

##The Guardian Editorial Board: Ethnic Armenians are pouring out of the enclave. But the US and Europe must press Azerbaijan to respect the rights of those who remain

>What is clear is that few are willing to take the risk of staying. The context is a months-long blockade, which left residents without food or medicines; the warnings from Ilham Aliyev, the autocratic president of Azerbaijan, to “bend your necks”; last week’s military offensive, during which civilians, including children, were killed; and claims of abuses by Azerbaijan’s troops

##Armenia asks the World Court to require Azerbaijan to withdraw its forces from Nagorno-Karabakh civilian settlements: 

(1) Azerbaijan shall refrain from taking any actions aimed at displacing the remaining ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, or preventing the safe and expeditious return to their homes of persons displaced in the course of the recent military attack, while permitting those who wish to leave Nagorno-Karabakh to do so without any hindrance;

(2) Azerbaijan shall withdraw all military and law-enforcement personnel from all civilian establishments in Nagorno-Karabakh occupied as a result of its armed attack on 19 September 2023;

(3) Azerbaijan must allow the entry of UN specialists and not interfere with their work.

(4) Azerbaijan must cooperate with the Red Cross and not interfere with their work.

(5) Azerbaijan must immediately restore public utilities, including gas and electricity.

(6) Azerbaijan must not be allowed to take punitive actions against political or military officials of Nagorno-Karabakh.

(7) Azerbaijan must not destroy Armenian monuments.

(8) Azerbaijan shall recognize and give effect to civil registers, identity documents and property titles and registers established by the authorities of Nagorno-Karabakh, and shall not destroy or confiscate such registers and documents;

##equal party 

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan believed that by recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan it would be possible to use international mechanisms to ensure the rights and protections of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. Why did this strategy fail?

**RULING MP:** Armenia did everything possible to help organize negotiations between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan under a Western format with international mechanisms. These negotiations did not take place for obscure reasons. We witnessed a coup in Nagorno-Karabakh. The organizers of the coup claimed that the replacement of the government would *improve* Nagorno-Karabakh's security. But it unfolded differently and they capitulated within a few days. They should have followed Armenia's advice and agreed to negotiate. *[Nagorno-Karabakh rejected the first offer, Azerbaijan rejected the second offer]*

**REPORTER:** Samvel Babayan was holding separate negotiations with Azerbaijan. What can you tell us about his 23-point document?

**RULING MP:** Samvel Babayan realized where this was all headed so he organized his own initiative as a last-ditch effort. He was able to reach certain agreements with Azerbaijan but official Stepanakert was still dismissive.

**REPORTER:** How was Babayan able to find a common language with Azerbaijan?

**RULING MP:** By not being a [Russian] agent.

**ARTAK BEGLARYAN:** Artsakh President’s decree on dissolving the Republic is illegitimate: (1) No President has the power to dissolve the Republic formed by the people with referendum; (2) That decree was signed as a result of Azerbaijani aggression & threat of force. It’s null & void.

##Armenian parliament leader accuses Russia of adopting the same language as Turkey and Azerbaijan; accuses [Russia] of having ""lust for power"" against Ukraine and attempting to overthrow the Armenian government

Alen Simonyan is in Dublin for the European Conference of Presidents of Parliament.

**SIMONYAN:** The challenges facing liberalism and representative democracy are profound. Robust solutions are imperative. 

Look no further than the war in Ukraine to witness the lust for power throughout the world, through the instrument of force. This anti-democratic regression occurs to the detriment of human rights and conflicts with the collective values outlined in the European Convention on Human Rights.

We are acutely aware of the pivotal role that democracy plays in safeguarding human rights and promoting the common good. 
Among the threats that undermine the foundations of this political order are autocratic governance and justice unrealized. 

Armenia knows the value of true democracy. The fortification of democracy through the strengthening of institutions, legislative improvements, and reforms in governance is a priority for us. Our commitment to democratic principles was the most significant factor enabling us to overcome the serious political crisis resulting from the devastating 44-day war instigated by Azerbaijan against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. 

Peace and democracy are interlinked, and governments facing existential threats are under enormous pressure to realize the mandates they were elected to carry out. The war in Nagorno-Karabakh revealed that autocratic regimes, based on the notion that “might is right,” often resolve conflicts through military force, bypassing international mediation.

Today, our democracy continues to face numerous tests. It is endangered by external factors - none greater than military threats to our security and territorial integrity. Understandably, the constant threat of violence has a dire effect on the welfare of our society. Through its drumbeat of hateful, xenophobic rhetoric - accompanied by ultimatums and military aggression - Azerbaijan has created a toxic atmosphere and poisoned the peace process.

Feckless responses from the international community have created in Azerbaijan a sense of impunity, worsening the situation in the region. 

Azerbaijani actions are not confined to Nagorno-Karabakh but extend to the sovereign territories of Armenia, some of which remain under Azerbaijan’s control. Azerbaijan’s approach is to impose its preferred solutions on Armenia through force.

I was not surprised that our Turkish colleague approved the use of military force against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh. I am not surprised that Turkiye, Azerbaijan and Russia are often using the same rhetoric. What I am surprised by is that they are doing so here, at the organization that was founded for the protection of human rights.

Despite the presence of the Russian peacekeepers, Azerbaijan unleashed another large-scale military attack against Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. As I speak, in fulfillment of Azerbaijan’s ethnic cleansing plan, the exodus of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, is underway.

Through its actions, which minimized international efforts to build peace in the South Caucasus, Azerbaijan has called into question its fitness to be a member of the Council of Europe.

October 5th meeting in Granada will be a step forward. Armenia strongly endorses peace. We welcome future transport arrangements that respect the principles of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and reciprocity. We call on the international community, including the Council of Europe, to support this process.

Today, a hybrid war is being waged by certain countries against Armenia. Its goals are twofold: overthrow the democratically elected government and discredit the notion of representative democracy itself. 

Democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights, and peaceful co-existence are the pillars upon which humankind should live in peace and harmony. This is true not only within democratic states individually but also among them collectively. Together - and perhaps only together - can we prevail over the troubles of our time. The center must hold. //

##several Armenian NGOs urge the government to immediately withdraw from CSTO, remove the Russian military base, and counter Russia's attempts to destabilize Armenia internally 

**NGOs:** Since the signing of the Nov. 9 agreement, Russia has repeatedly failed to follow its obligations and has chosen to side with Azerbaijan repeatedly. Lately, Russia has been destabilizing Armenia and threatening its sovereignty. We demand the government of Armenia to:

(1) Thwart all attempts by Russia to intervene in our internal political processes.

(2) Cancel all AM-RU television re-broadcasting agreements. Require cable operators to shut down Russian channels that are engaged in anti-Armenia propaganda or broadcast calls against the sovereignty of Armenia. 

(3) Launch an official process to withdraw from CSTO. Create necessary conditions to increase military-technical cooperation with the West.

(4) Transfer all border duties to Armenian agents in Zvartnots airport, AM-TR and AM-IR borders, as stipulated by the 1991 AM-RU agreement.

(5) Launch an official process to withdraw the 102nd Russian military base from Armenia.

##interview with Informed Citizens NGO chief Daniel Ioannesian 

**REPORTER:** An outlet with ties to the Armenian government reports that Armenia wants Russia to return the $400M that was transferred for purchasing weapons. The sum was paid 2 years ago, well before the Ukraine war, yet even then Russia failed to deliver them. Russia reportedly doesn't want to return the funds because the ""contracts have not been canceled yet"". How accurate is this report?

**DANIEL:** I can verify that Armenia has transferred $400M and received nothing so far. Sure, the delivery of *some* of the weapons was expected to take years, but according to the contracts, Russia should have delivered $150M in arms by now. It's overdue. I don't think it will ever arrive. (1) Russia doesn't want to arm the Armenian army. (2) Russia itself needs those weapons. 

$400M is not a small sum. We have alternative markets today. If we leave the CSTO, other markets can offer better options. No Western official in their right mind would want to risk selling serious weapons to a country that's formally associated with Russia. 

**REPORTER:** Can Armenia nationalize Russian assets, companies owned and operated by the Russian state, if they refuse to refund it?

**DANIEL:** Գույք պարտքի դիմաց *[a reference to Kocharyan handing over Armenian infrastructure to Russia ""to pay off the debt""]*. I'm not an expert in that field. It's a legal issue. Can we enter arbitration or not. I don't know.

**REPORTER:** Russia believes Armenia is not a good ally.

**DANIEL:** Seriously? The issues with Russia began after it refused to acknowledge and condemn the invasion of Armenia proper by Azerbaijan, despite having contractual obligations. Not a single CSTO country helped Armenia. Can you imagine if NATO acted this spinelessly? Even after everything Turkey had done to piss off the West, they still supported Turkey when it faced terror threats. 

What else is Armenia supposed to do to please Russia? We have given them our nuclear field, railways, gas monopoly, ownership of pipes, an effective monopoly in electricity exports, and a membership to the EAEU that is actually harmful to us. If we exit the EAEU right now, the prices of many products on our shelves will plummet by 10%-80%. What else does Russia want us to give them?

**REPORTER:** To give them our membership in the Russian Union with Belarus.

**DANIEL:** [Dick] is what we should give them.

**REPORTER:** Why is there a crisis in AM-RU relations?

**DANIEL:** It's obvious now that the only thing Russia can give us is enmity. Armenia is taking steps to show the West that Armenia's position has changed. We need Western support right now. But the West is very cautious because they have been f&%ked over by Serj once. Serj spent 3.5 years negotiating with the EU to then make a U-turn and join Russia. It was a serious damage to Armenia's reputation as a trustworthy partner. That is what I hear a lot, including very recently from a German official.

**REPORTER:** What can the West do for Armenia?

**DANIEL:** (1) Military-technical cooperation, (2) Energy independence, (3) Economic cooperation and easier exports to Europe.

Our food producers will face major issues if Russia bans Armenian products. Russia will obviously use this tool to pressure us. We need Europe as an alternative destination. We need Europe to help us increase production and quality standards. 

As for energy, the EU can help us through various programs. Low-interest loans for solar panel installations, energy-efficient construction and renovation, etc. Europe should help us with 2-3 large energy projects:

Build a large electricity storage facility. Our nuclear plant produces a fixed amount of energy at all times. Its nighttime production is not being used. To make things worse, if we build a new nuclear plant with a 2x capacity, the utilization of nighttime production will become an even bigger problem. We need to store that electricity somewhere. Don't think of it like battery storage. It should be a facility. Let's say two reservoirs at different altitudes. The nighttime electricity could be used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir. During the daytime, when we need more electricity, the water can pour back into the lower reservoir and generate electricity like a hydropower plant. *[might as well connect a power strip to itself for unlimited energy]*.

Armenia must join the proposed Azerbaijan-Georgia-Romania-Hungary electric network and export electricity to Europe. We will be in a better position than Georgia and Azerbaijan. We could sell the nighttime excess electricity to Europe. //

##Indian engineers are building reinforced border positions: Andranik Kocharyan, ranking ruling MP

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan and Turkey want a ""Zangezur corridor"". 

**ANDRANIK:** No corridor. Stop beating a dead horse. I don't know why they still call it that way. 

Our best protection is our army and strong borders. One of these days I'm going to invite every media outlet and take you to the southern borders so you can see the new engineering structures. I want you to *feel* the amount of dedicated work that was done over the past several months.

Indian workers were part of this process. They are my brothers. They are doing something that many Armenians didn't want to do. We must have engineering squads, we must take care of our state, and we must feel like we own our country.

I spoke with Samvel Babayan shortly before his departure to Armenia. I urged him to be careful and not get arrested while entering Armenia. He said he won't get arrested, but if he does, he will ""take a few Azeris with him to Armenia"". Babayan and Azerbaijani authorities have a complicated history dating back to the 1st war. //

##Կենացները քաղցրանում են։ Hayk Marutyan is facing a dillema 

The context is in [Thursday report](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16uv5ol/armenias_defense_budget_to_reach_14b_exodus/): The shaky alliance between the 3 opposition forces fell apart yesterday. Marutyan, the lead candidate for Yerevan mayor, has called for new elections after learning that Dog's party could not secure enough votes for his appointment. In order for new elections to be held, the 33 opposition Council members (trio) must unanimously boycott the first session. Marutyan fears that if at least one of Dog's members shows up, the Council will have the quorum to organize a session and elect the ruling party's Tigran Avinyan as the mayor. 

##... new developments 

Dog is holding Marutyan hostage. He wants Marutyan and the former regime to sign a 3-way contract. In exchange for helping to boycott the first session and triggering new elections, Dog wants written guarantees that his party members will be appointed to lead a third of all Yerevan districts.

Marutyan had earlier categorically refused to sign any formal contract with them. He has until October 10 to decide.

If Marutyan refuses, Dog could ""help"" Avinyan get elected while settling for minority seats and calling it a day. But if Dog triggers new elections, it's a big gamble because he risks being wiped out in the event of higher voter turnout. Avinyan suddenly has a chance to become the mayor if Dog chickens out.

12/2/2016,The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict: The Unfortunate Role Of Propaganda [/u/IZLI],
7/19/2020,"Debunking the myth propagated by Turkish and Azeri government PR that Armenia is a horrible place to live compared to their countries and is on the brink of collapse. As you'll see below, in reality Armenia is miles ahead of both of these countries in a lot of ways and roughly equal in some others","I'm sure you've encountered a Turkish or Azeri person on the internet who can't stop talking about how Armenia is dying of hunger, that there's so much repression that living here is worse than North Korea and that it's so bad people would rather live in South Sudan instead.

It's not accidental the population thinks like this. The narrative has been constructed over 2 decades by Turkish and Azeri state propaganda. On state TV and media, they constantly portray Armenia as being on the verge of famine and collapse.

People who live in Armenia or tourists that have visited the country of course know that these are absolute lies that have nothing to do with reality.

But the amount of mostly Turkish and Azeri people that actually believe these myth is hilariously large.

So what can we do to help the more rational segments in the Turkish and Azeri societies to see through the propaganda? Simply saying it's propaganda isn't enough. The common answer is ""you're lying!"".

Normally I *really* wouldn't care about this kind of comparisons but just for educational purposes, let's present some data by international organizations to see the real picture.

# The 2019 Legatum Prosperity Index

The Legatum Prosperity Index is a framework that assesses countries on the promotion of their residents’ flourishing, reflecting both economic and social wellbeing. It captures the richness of a truly prosperous life, moving beyond traditional macroeconomic measurements of a nation’s prosperity, which rely solely on indicators of wealth such as average income per person (GDP per capita). It redefines the way success is measured, changing the conversation from what we are getting, to who we are becoming. This makes it an authoritative measure of human progress, offering a unique insight into how prosperity is forming and changing across nearly all countries of the world.

In short, there are 12 pillars of prosperity:

**Safety & Security:** measures the degree to which conflict, terror, and crime have destabilised the security of individuals, both immediately and through longer lasting effects.

**Personal Freedom:** measures country-wide progress towards basic legal rights, individual liberties, and social tolerance.

**Governance pillar:** measures the extent to which there are checks and restraints on power and whether governments operate effectively and without corruption.

**Social Capital**: measures the strength of personal and social relationships, social norms, and civic participation in a country.

**Investment Environment:** measures the extent to which investments are adequately protected and are readily accessible.

**Enterprise Conditions**: measures the degree to which regulations enable businesses to start, compete, and expand.

**Market Access & Infrastructure**: measures the quality of the infrastructure that enables trade, and distortions in the market for goods and services.

**Economic Quality**: measures how well a state’s economy is equipped to generate wealth sustainably and with the full engagement of its workforce.

**Living Conditions**: measures the degree to which a reasonable quality of life is experienced by all, including material resources, shelter, basic services, and connectivity.

**Health**: measures the extent to which people are healthy and have access to the necessary services to maintain good health, including health outcomes, healthy systems, illness and risk factors, and mortality rates.

**Education**: measures enrolment, outcomes, and quality across four stages of education (pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary education), as well as the skills in the adult population.

**Natural Environment**: measures the aspects of the physical environment that have a direct effect on people in their daily lives and changes that might impact the prosperity of future generations.

[Here's the full ranking of countries with Armenia, Turkey and Azerbaijan pinned at the top](https://www.prosperity.com/rankings?pinned=ARM,AZE,TUR&filter=).

*Armenia is ahead of both Turkey and Azerbaijan in 6 out of 12 pillars. It's ahead of at least one of the two in 8 out of 12 pillars.*

*According to the Legatum Prosperity Index, in 2019:*

# The 2019 Democracy Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit

Intends to measure the state of democracy in 167 countries, of which 166 are sovereign states and 164 are UN member states.

The democracy index is a weighted average based on the answers of 60 questions, each one with either two or three permitted alternative answers. Most answers are experts' assessments. Some answers are provided by public-opinion surveys from the respective countries. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar countries, and expert assessments are used in order to fill in gaps.

The questions are grouped into five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture.

[For more details, check this link](https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index).

*According to EIU, in 2019:*

* *Armenia is the* ***86th*** *most democratic country*
* *Turkey* ***110th***
* *Azerbaijan* ***146th***

# The 2020 Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index

The degree of freedom available to journalists in 180 countries is determined by pooling the responses of experts to a questionnaire devised by RSF. This qualitative analysis is combined with quantitative data on abuses and acts of violence against journalists during the period evaluated. The criteria evaluated in the questionnaire are pluralism, media independence, media environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, and the quality of the infrastructure that supports the production of news and information.

[Detailed methodology here](https://rsf.org/en/detailed-methodology).

*According to RPW, in 2019*

* *Armenia has the* ***61st*** *freest press*
* *Turkey* ***154th***
* *Azerbaijan* ***168th***

&#x200B;

# The 2019 Freedom House Freedom on the Net Index

Freedom House assesses the level of internet freedom in 65 countries around the world through its annual Freedom on the Net report, examining issues including connectivity, blocking and filtering, and users’ risk of arrest or assault in reprisal for their online activity.

[More information](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net).

*According to FH, in 2019 (score out of 100)*

* *Armenia* ***76/100*** *(8th freest in the world)*
* *Azerbaijan* ***39/100***
* *Turkey* ***37/100***

# World Bank 2019 GDP per Capita (current US$) data

[Graph with the 3 countries](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=AM-AZ-TR).

*Turkey -* ***9,042***

*Azerbaijan -* ***4,793***

*Armenia -* ***4,622***

Turkey's figure is about twice higher and Azerbaijan's pretty much the same as Armenia.

&#x200B;

# Workd Bank 2019 GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)

[Graph with the 3 countries](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=AM-AZ-TR).

*Turkey -* ***27,875***

*Azerbaijan -* ***15,000***

*Armenia -* ***14,219***

Again, Turkey's figure is almost twice higher. Armenia and Azerbaijan at the same level.

&#x200B;

# What did we learn?

Turkey's economy is more developed than Azerbaijan's and Armenia's. Armenia and Azerbaijan have almost equally developed economies despite Azerbaijan sitting on huge amounts of natural resources.

On the other hand, regarding governance, personal freedom, media and internet freedom, social capital, Armenia is a long away ahead of both Turkey and Azerbaijan.

In reality we all know that this isn't a christian vs muslim war. It's a war to try and erase Armenian identity as they already tried to do so once before. Most Iranian azeri's that aren't brainwashed by the pan-turk propaganda also agree with this and don't support azerbaijan in this conflict so I hope you guys can seperate them from the usual azerbaijan crowd. 

That said the protests in iran are barely in thousands and some of them are directly done so by the government to try and cause confusion (as irans economy is very bad nowdays). Iran has 15-20 million Turks and a huge majority of them are supporting Armenia or are neutral.

Neither let their casualties be known, and both played up their kills on the field to make it sound like they were winning more. I think by October Azerbaijan was claiming to have destroyed more AFVs than actually existed in Armenia. 

That propaganda mud fight was carried out by two developing nations with 3rd rate military forces.

Here is Stepan Grigoryan's analysis on the whole situation. Unlike us here, he is doing this for a living, and he is very well connected in the government and abroad. He is always participating in international summits with foreign diplomats and experts. He is one of the most objective experts in Armenia. 

Main points are how important the Rome Statute ratification for us is.

How Armenia fucked up by only partially joining the 17 point declaration made during the Biden's Democracy summit, and how we immediately paid the price politically and physically.

I know most people here don't like to sit and watch nearly hour long analysis in Armenian. However I notice how many people like to come in hot takes. I say if we gonna come in hot, the price should be listening to people who know what they are talking about."

##Shushi battles / eye-witness account by a soldier
 
Q: did you participate in Shushi battles?
 
A: Yes. For 4 days. It began on the night of November 3rd. We were attacked by an infantry followed by artillery strikes. They were hitting our artillery and infantry. When we moved down to the village [Qarin Tak?] they began using airforce, drones, artillery, cluster bombs, etc.  
 
We fired at each other for two days nonstop. They had around 800 losses. We were told to leave from there, followed by four Azeri jets bombing the area where we were.
 
They began firing from another location. Then it stopped. Around November 12th Shushi was ours but Karabakh already wasn't.
 
Q: where there Azeris in Shushi?
 
A: Yes. We held one part of the city, while Azeris held another. We left on November 14th. 
 
Q: How did you leave?
 
A: Russian peacekeepers came and we left without shooting.
 
Q: how many wounded did you have?
 
A: none. There were 12 of us.
 
Q: how old are you?
 
A: 19. I'm a conscript.
 
Q: how far away were Azeris?
 
A: around 100 meters.

##political turmoil continues // coup guys, howlers, walls, and soldiers
 
Yesterday a group of acting/former security service officials and opposition figures were arrested [under the suspicion of organizing an assassination against PM Pashinyan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-armenia-security-premier/armenia-says-prevented-assassination-attempt-on-prime-minister-idUSKBN27U0P1). An audio call was leaked. Some of them were kept in jail by a judge, while others were released before the trial.
 
Hours later Pashinyan wrote: ""Today I watched videos shared by dozens of soldiers in the front lines. I'm amazed by their insight. Guys, you are right. I'm waiting for you in Yerevan to finally solve the problem of those howling under the walls. I'm proud of you.""
 
The opposition called it a threat of physical violence and urged law enforcement to take action. An opposition figure wrote, ""Pashinyan will soon go underground"".
 
The Human Rights Ombudsman asked the public not to share hateful social media posts.

An opposition figure Andranik Tevanyan urged ruling QP MPs to resign otherwise ""they'll be held accountable"". ""Any MP who leaves the party will be given a humanitarian path to exit. Otherwise, everyone will sign under the agreement of capitulation and self-destruction.""

Three QP MPs had resigned amid the turmoil.
 
**Prime Minister office chief of staff:** the latest comment by PM was interpreted in various ways. Many thought of it as an attempt to incite a civil war. I assure you it was a misunderstanding. The post was a ""thank you"" to the heroic men who fought in front lines for weeks, who are now calling for the public not to fall for provocations and to unite for the sake of Armenia and Artsakh.
 
The U.S. Ambassador spoke with QP Party leader Lilith Makunts. Both reaffirmed their joint commitment to strengthening democracy and the rule of law in Armenia. ""Political violence & intimidation have no place in a democratic society,"" said the Ambassador.""
 
Artsakh president Arayik has called for political peace in Armenia. He added that the process of recovering bodies continues. 150 more bodies were transferred from Shushi.
 
 https://news.am/arm/news/613638.html
 
President Sarkissian has called for restraint and vigilance despite the pain. 
 
 https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034968.html
 
**Pashinyan:** regarding my earlier Facebook post. I wrote that I await them in Yerevan. Some interpreted that as a call for civil war and clashes. If you watch the videos I responded to, the soldiers are returning home after being discharged, without weapons. I chose to publicly announce a meeting with them upon their return. No one is returning from the front lines with weapons. 

As for the phrase ""those howling under the walls"", I chose to use that harsh statement because certain official bodies also used it (maybe referring to a judge who earlier made a statement about ""howling"", followed by assassination suspect Arthur Vanetsyan being released from jail).
 
When the frontline soldiers return, we'll find out answers to many questions and put an end to the conspiracy theories about political-military leadership.
 
I spoke with the police to make sure none of the returning soldiers have weapons.

The ruling Parliamentary party launched a process to terminate BHK leader Gagik Tsaraukyan's MP mandate. They will send a petition to the Constitutional court.

The opposition parties resumed their rallies. The demands are the same: Pashinyan should resign, they won't hold any meetings or discussions with him. They marched to the prosecutors' office. ""Nikol, the public will pay your pension and ensure your safety, just leave,"" said an ARF official.

Prosecutors will appeal the lower court decision that kept Arthur Vanetsyan out of jail. He is one of the former officials suspected of organizing a coup and assassination of the Prime Minister. The lower court didn't find enough evidence to keep him locked up pre-trial.
 
Another suspect, Vahram Baghdasaryan, was also released by the court.

Former general prosecutor Gevorg Kostanyan urged his ex-colleague prosecutors and cops to join their side and disobey the government. 
 
Context: Kostanyan is on the run. He was accused of being the ""handler"" who went between several law enforcement agencies in March 2008 to coordinate the disposal of bullet shells that the police forced fired at protesters. At the time, 8 protestors were killed. After the arrival of Pashinyan, a felony case was launched over the incident. Former president Kocharyan [president at the time of the incident] and several of his allies were charged.
 
https://news.am/arm/news/613669.html
 
**Prosecutors urge opposition not to pressure law enforcement:**
 
Lately, individuals who have recently been prosecuted in various criminal cases, who evaded justice, and have the prospect of criminal liability, as well as their supporters, have been trying to manipulate the law enforcement bodies with emotional statements to influence their actions.
 
The prosecutors and law enforcement are apolitical bodies. We condemn any attempts to involve them in political processes.
 
[The opposition had earlier publicly urged the army and the law enforcement to join them against the Prime Minister]:
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034998.html

The police continue to find weapons in cars returning from Artsakh. Kalashnikov and bullets were confiscated in Yeghegnadzor.
 
https://factor.am/310467.html
 
Human rights ombudsman condemned opposition and government figures for using provocative language.

https://news.am/arm/news/613834.html




##Pashinyan about the tense atmosphere and violence
 
Look at what happened to Parliament Speaker Ararat Mirzoyan (he was severely beaten by opposition activists, doctors saved his life with surgeries). Nothing of this kind has happened to opposition figures in the past 2.5 years (when he came into office). The majority of opposition did not even condemn the November 10th riots.
 
I expect the opposition to publicly state that they are against political violence and the use of weapons. 
When the internal atmosphere improves, we'll be able to have a dialogue with the opposition to together overcome the situation.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034987.html
 
 
 
 
##Pashinyan about the negotiations process
 
Artsakh's legal status must become the heart of the negotiation process with new intensity and new capacity. (Earlier he complained that for the last 25 years, the main negotiations were over giving lands to Azerbaijan with not enough emphasis on Artsakh status)
 
 
##Pashinyan about soldiers
 
We have several hundred missing soldiers. I hope for the best. Yesterday several missing soldiers were found alive.
 
Exchanging POWs will happen after the exchange of bodies. There will be a day of mourning once the process completes.
 
We must help the wounded soldiers, and soldiers' family members now. There needs to be a continuous communication with them. The soldier must see that the country stands by him. There will be vocational training courses for those who want to change professions.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034971.html , https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034974.html
 

 
##Pashinyan about cooperating with the opposition
 
[Opposition says they can change the document to make it more favorable.] I have not received such an offer from them on how to improve the document's terms. Going backward and changing the terms of the signed document means changing the military status, which is impractical today.
 
As for the future negotiations process, the document leaves many points for future clarification. During these clarifications, all the  
suggestions will be taken into account, and we will try to implement the best ones.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034975.html
 
 
##Pashinyan about the negotiation process before the war and his responsibility
 
By May 2018 (before he took the office), the negotiation process had already crossed the point of no return. It was all about giving lands to Azerbaijan in exchange for nothing. Some HHK officials (today opposition) were publicly stating that there are complications and we'd need to give away lands.
 
That means there are three options: either those former officials were oracles, or I'm a traitor, or the former officials already knew where the negotiations had reached.
 
My administration tried to change the course of negotiations to make it more favorable. Unfortunately, we couldn't. There was already an international consensus that the lands must be given to Azerbaijan without any conditions.
 
Were we supposed to give away the lands? We tried to resist through negotiations. I also took steps to prepare the army by improving the armament.
 
I'm blamed for signing and giving away lands today. I'm also blamed for not giving them away sooner.
 
Our army fought for as long as it was possible.
 
There is no doubt that I am the number one public official responsible for the situation. I will stand before our people. However, the public should know all these details to make conclusions.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034979.html
 
  
##Pashinyan about accusations of keeping other officials in dark
 
We held two security council meetings during the war, participated by Parliamentary parties, the President, the Church leader.
 
We held separate meetings with non-Parliamentary opposition parties to discuss the situation. They were aware of the trends.
 
Some of the decisions had to be made within hours at the request of the military, so we couldn't discuss it with opposition first. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034985.html
 
 
##Pashinyan addressing rumors about ""giving away Shushi""
 
The army fought a heroic battle until the last second, but the Armenian side lost Shushi because the enemy managed to penetrate the city. Shushi was not handed over. Artsakh president mentioned today about recovering 150 more bodies from Shushi. If the city was ""given away"", then who ordered them to fight.
 
There were rumors about traitors inside Shushi who gave specific orders. The law enforcement questioned the person who spread the rumors to learn more details, but the person refused to answers questions.  
 
The truth is painful, but we lost Shushi because the enemy was able to break in.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034993.html
 

##Pashinyan addressing opposition rumors about U.S.
 
Q: is it true that you consulted with the US before signing the Document?
 
A: of course not. During this war, I've spoken with the US five times: three with O'Brian and two with Pompeo. We discussed suggestions from the US. On the other hand, there were days when I spoke with Putin five times a day.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034982.html
 
 
 
##Pashinyan about Artsakh army
 
Artsakh will continue to have it's Defense Army, even after signing of the document. The army will have the same status. It must develop, strengthen, and be the guarantor of Artsakh sovereignty.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034988.html
 
 
 
##NSS border defenders
 
National Security Services had also sent a group of volunteers and reservists. 46 sacrificed their lives, 191 wounded, 2 missing.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034989.html
 
 
##several officials quit/fired
 
Foreign Minister Zohrap Mnatsakanyan has submitted his resignation papers.
 
Artak Davtyan is no longer the head of the military industry.

##Pashinyan meets political parties in Parliament for a 2-hour Q&A
 
##Q: were there calculations before the war on how long we could last in the event of war, considering resource discrepancy?
 
We discussed this during the Security Council meetings on several occasions. Our conclusion was that we would have enough resources to resist aggression by the Azerbaijani army. 
 
##Q: why weren't there any steps to prevent the war?
 
Preventing a war was always on our agenda, but it has never been viewed as ""at the cost of everything and anything"". Preventing this war would mean ""lands in exchange for peace"" proposal. We would have to give away lands.
 
That would be the continuation of the downward spiral in the negotiations that we've witnessed in the past many years when Armenia would agree to concede, then Azeris would demand more and more. Last year we decided to consolidate our physical power to resist possible attacks.
 


##Q: How can people help Artsakh refugees now?
 
I spoke with the Artsakh president and I'm happy to say that many refugees are now returning to their homes. Over 1,000 by now. The houses should be renovated; our governments will work on it. Lachin corridor will reopen today and the process will expedite.
 
##Q: where was our mistake? What were the shortcomings of air defense? Armament in the past 30 years? 

Our mistake in the past 2.5 years was our inability to close the existing gaps in the army. Although we did have massive achievements in air defense. We purchased TOR,  modernized OSA-AKA units, etc. Practice showed that these weapons aren't enough against the modern high-tech; a technology [Bayraktar] that came into play just in the past few months, and tipped the balance.
 
Overall, Armenia's two biggest strategic mistakes post-1990s war were believing that we could forever avoid a war, and the idea of ""don't give an inch of land"".
 
From 1998, there was only one significant emphasis: the return of 7 regions to Azerbaijan. This was the only clearly defined thing. Let's see what happened in international institutes in the past 25 years: Dozens of documents, resolutions, statements that re-enforced the idea of our requirement to give away lands.
 
We should have chosen: either we give some lands, or we choose war.
 
##Q: my research shows that the size of our conscript army shrank in half in the past 10 years. It was also our mistake that the ruling and opposition parties haven't done enough to address this. The opposition has its share to blame.
 
We are accused of failing foreign policy and giving away lands. So what did the opposition want: not to give away lands, or to avoid a war? You had to pick one.
 
Now they say ""why didn't you give away lands **sooner** to end the war sooner?"". Because the war would not have ended sooner. It could stop under the conditions that we have today [land concessions]. The army and the govt chose to fight for as long as possible. We made our choice and I don't believe that was the wrong choice. Unfortunately, we failed to achieve the desired outcome.
 
##Q: are there plans for internal stability? Any plan on consolidating efforts before future negotiations?
 
We need to condemn and avoid violence. I publicly declare that we don't want or incite civil unrest, and we ask the opposition to also declare that they don't plan to use force. 

If they do, we will have a peaceful dialogue. I have my doubts because when the November 10th riots took place and the Govt/Parliament were attacked, to this day the opposition hasn't condemned it. My appearance today is also an act of dialogue with the opposition.
 
As for future negotiations, our top priority is the Artsakh status, refugee return, economical topics. All our efforts, including the Parliament, should be involved with the process.
 
 
##Q: should there be a dialogue specifically with those opposition parties who are currently ready to be peaceful?
 
Dialogue is possible with any political party, as long as there is a willingness to have one. But they need to condemn violence first. I agree, we should all be careful with emotional statements.
 
 
##Q: about future negotiations & elections

**Q:** what happened to our country was treason; I don't mean the document signed by you. Only during the war did we learn that the defense/MFA wasn't ready. Admit that you and your team failed. Certain officials should resign. As for the negotiation process, unlike [fellow] opposition members, I still believe that you should be the one to find a way out of this situation, and once the roadmap is clear, we need snap elections. If people vote for you again, so be it, continue with the work, but we need a roadmap for the future.
 
**A**: the job of every agency is being analyzed. Our main task right now is to have a discourse under peaceful and democratic conditions. We can't hold elections right now. Once the peaceful atmosphere is restored, and there is no more doubt that the elections would be democratic, we can talk about new elections.
 
I urge all opposition parties to publicly condemn violence and state that they don't plan to use force to achieve things. At the same time, our law enforcement is able to prevent any possible violence.
 
##Q: we should strengthen the army. We are accused of not doing enough to find money to improve the army. People point where the money is. Any plans to recover them?
 
Today we have many former officials who make speeches about Artsakh. They possess millions of dollars worth of [embezzled] properties. These people have no right to speak about Artsakh. It's the money that they stole that could have formed institutes in Armenia. 

We talk about our diplomatic abilities today; our diplomatic potential would have been better had we invested in time. It wasn't done for decades.
 
After coming to power in 2018, we followed the law, we said there won't be vendettas. We created legal methods to recover resources stolen from the public [asset forfeiture law]. These laws are starting to go into effect today. The recovered resources will be invested in our future potential. We cannot do vendettas, however.
 
##Q: any mental health support for soldiers returning from war?
 
Yes. We discussed it with Healthcare Ministry. The private sector and businesses also offered to help with their resources.
 
##Q: as far as I'm aware, in the prior negotiation packages, the status of Shushi was not part of any.
 
The past 2.5 years of negotiations and meetings had left no doubt that preventing the war would require Armenia giving away lands, and still have no status for Artsakh. We would also need to give up the right to discuss Artsakh's legal status in the near future, and also give Shushi. *[Shushi part was later clarified since some people thought he was ""lying"" about Shushi being part of past negotiations]*
 
The opposition is showing a document and saying ""Shushi isn't mentioned in this one"". Yes, Shushi isn't in it, that's why that document was never accepted by Azerbaijan. [He is hinting that Azerbaijan has always wanted Shushi as its major goal and that every time Armenia yielded something, Azeris wanted more.]
 
There are many documents. Was the Kazan document ever signed by Azerbaijan? There was another one before that. Why wasn't neither one of them accepted? Does no one ask?
 
We had certain outcomes that we could have, under certain conditions. There were many documents. We can print a very favorable document and circulate it today, but it's nothing if it's rejected. Some documents are now circulated for propaganda purposes. The opposition is trying to say that at some point we had a better choice but we rejected it.
 
**We had two options after the 2016 clashes began**: give up our rights or defend our rights. Do you not wonder why the 2016 war was stopped but this one wasn't? Do you know under what conditions the 2016 war was stopped? The opposition knew where the negotiation process was as of 2018, when they ""predicted"" a bad outcome upon my election.
 
On the first day, I told you while standing here in Parliament: we can stop the war RIGHT NOW and the conditions that would stop it. The opposition decried the conditions. Now they say ""why didn't you stop"". Are we traitors for fighting?
 
They rightfully blame us for high casualties, but at the same time, they blame us for saving 30,000 soldiers from encirclement by signing the Document. Let them not play oracle now.
 
##Q: can you clarify the Shushi part, about it being or not being in negotiating documents?
 
I think I might not fully understand your context about the Shushi question, since it's being asked again. Are you asking if Shushi was part of the prior negotiation process? Please clarify. In any case, if we could preserve it, we would.
 
**MP Clarifying:** you earlier said that the war could be avoided or stopped if Shushi was given to Azeris. But the Foreign Ministry spokesperson wrote, ""the peace negotiations did not contain a question of giving away Shushi"". This statement caused various interpretations. Clarify the Shushi part before and after the war.
 
**Pashinan**: before the war, during the negotiations, there was always a topic about returning refugees to their homes. When on official-level we tried to obtain clarification on what that would mean, and what would be acceptable by Azerbaijan, it was clear that Azerbaijan always demanded that their refugees return to Shushi. Always. *[Shushi region had a large Azeri population before 90s war. Azeris consider it as their crown jewel and the heart.]*
 
During the war, there were options to stop the war. Not in the very beginning, but at some point (5-7 days into war) Shushi became a demand by Azerbaijan. This is an undeniable fact. *[tldr: on the 5-7th day of the war Armenians thought the army could defend Artsakh so they didn't accept a deal; later the Azeris demanded Shushi so Armenians decided to continue to fight instead of giving it away]*


##Q: the war showed that Armenia's only friend was Russia. did Turkey and Azerbaijan go for war thinking there were cracks in AM-RU relations?
 
Myth number 1: the AM-RU relations are bad that's why this happened. In the past 4-5 years, Russia's stance over Karabakh has not changed.
 
Myth number 2: I was offered to resign to change the outcome of the war, but I refused and cling to power.
 
I had a very direct and frank conversation with [Russians] and I asked if my resignation would change anything. There are people in Parliament who know all these details. Now I'm giving you details I wasn't supposed to; too much transparency. As for AM-RU relations, they were/are/remain strategic.
 
##Q: refugees?
 
We're working on making it possible for refugees to return home and receive government assistance while already in Artsakh. The future negotiations will include discussions about the status of refugees who lost their homes (Hadrut), and possible options for their safe return.
 
##Q: many countries came out of war and became stronger over time. Can we expect peace in the region?
 
We need to analyze how we used our past 2.5 years, but also for the past 30 years. In the past 30 years, we lived with the idea of ""not an inch of land"" and ""prevent war"", while in reality, we had to choose between the two. 

We had to pick one and focus on it. We made our choice [prepare for war instead of giving the adjacent regions] in the past 2.5 years and we lost, and I carry full responsibility.
 
How many of you have visited the adjacent territories [that are will be soon given to Azerbaijan]? What work has been done in those regions in the past 30 years? [the former regime is accused of intentionally investing less money in 7 adjacent regions, expecting that one day they might belong to Azerbaijan].
 
For 30 years we screamed about the army being the institute with the highest rating, yet everyone tried to avoid serving in it. Was this not supposed to have its consequences?
 
We need to review our model of patriotism. Let me give a bribe, escape the army, then make a toast to honor the army. Did we not think about this for 30 years?
 
When we took a $10 bribe to vote for certain political parties for 30 years, when we evaded taxes, the large businesses evaded taxes then gave some donations and received praise in return; was this all going to go without consequences?
 
I carry full responsibility for what had happened in the past 30 years. No one else does. I will stand in the court of public opinion, but I raise questions and I demand the answers.
 
When for 30 years the public office was a way to embezzle public resources and we all knew and did nothing, aren't we not supposed to answer for it? We embezzled 30 years of our history.
 
If Shushi was ""sold"", then it was sold in the past 30 years. Shushi is a grim-looking poor city. If you wanted Shushi, why did you keep it in that poor condition?
 
Did you want those 7 regions? Then why did you not invest in them? They criticize me for visiting the Artsakh president's inauguration in Shushi. ""Why did you do it in Shushi"". For 30 years, the elites called Shushi an Armenian city, yet the president doesn't have the right to hold a ceremony there?
 
Shushi was sold when for 30 years the headlines wrote ""Shushi is Armenian"", yet in their minds, it wasn't.
 
What did you invest in Shushi? A few private donors gave charity. What else was done for Shushi by public officials? Shushi wasn't given on November 10th. Shushi was given when unruly weeds grew there for 30 years.
 
##Q: how can we solve the Artsakh conflict now to prevent passing it to future generations?
 
We need to consolidate our resources. We need Armenians and Artsakh Armenians to live on their lands and create and prosper. It all comes down to education. Bribing to avoid military service is also part of education. We need a change of mentality. For 30 years we never made any major education reforms. The education system was a servant of the acting political party.
 
##Q: when will we have the final number of casualties?
 
Identification and body exchange continues. We don't have final numbers. Some people were wondering if there were battles for Shushi. All you need to do is to look at the number of casualties on both sides in Shushi. 300 Armenian bodies were recovered in the past few days from Shushi.
 
Some have spread rumors about generals and politicians ordering not to fight for Shushi. The law enforcement invited them to clarify the rumors. When asked by police to testify, the rumor-spreaders tell stories of ""someone who I knew was sitting somewhere when someone came"" yadda yadda. 


##Q: mobilization of troops?
 
The mobilization system is outdated. The army structure and its functional roles should undergo significant reforms. We have contractors. Their size increased in the past 7-8 years. 

Contract service is also a job place where villages earn extra money alongside their daily work. They have a great role in defending the border. However, during a major war, there is a problem with involving them in various types of activities. The contractors don't have the efficiency of special tasks. Since 2019 we worked on this. The 3rd Army Corps underwent reforms.
 
 
##Q: any plans to strengthen ties with the diaspora?
 
45 years ago, over 70% of diasporan Armenians were affiliated with one diasporan organization or another. Today the picture is reversed. The majority are detached. We need to rebuild the connection.

##Artsakh refugees returning home / aid / school
 
The Armenian government will provide a one-time 68,000 Dram financial aid to refugees in addition to humanitarian aid. An additional 15,000 Drams if the person doesn't have a property in Armenia.
 
The government receives lots of calls from refugees who want info about how to return home. They no longer need paperwork to be able to reach Stepanakert.
 
The second group of Artsakh residents has moved back to Artsakh, accompanied by Russian peacekeepers. 19 buses transported 475 people, bringing the total from yesterday to 725.

7/26/2023,"Press conference by Pashinyan: Negotiation process, blockade, secession for salvation, economy, peacekeepers, Oskanian, UN Security Council, French weapons, ...","Collection of notable parts from the press conference. It's mostly a summary, not a word-for-word translation. I'll add clarifications in [square brackets].

##... opening statement

**PASHINYAN:** The world order is being decided in Ukraine. These are uncertain times for Armenia and others. The traditional East-West formula no longer functions in the South Caucasus. 

It is for this reason that Armenia must adopt a non-confrontational policy in our region. Armenia must clarify its place in the architecture of the South Caucasus. The states in our region should not have conflicts with each other. The blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh doesn't make it easy to accomplish this, but nevertheless, peace remains our primary goal.

##... pensions, high-tech, economy

**PASHINYAN:** June 2023 set a new record in the number of jobs in Armenia: 719,224. 

New jobs created since May 2018: 171,000.

Avg. salary in June, YoY: +13.7% (+$85)

Soldiers and teachers are undergoing an attestation process to prove their skills in exchange for a raise. Today we have teachers earning ֏507,000 ($1,300). There are already 22 teachers earning ֏400,000 ($1,035).

Today some army contractors earn ֏599,000 ($1,550) including taxes. Their salaries have doubled.

In 1Q2023 the tax collection exceeded expectations by ֏50b ($129m).

Pensions increased in July again. For the first time in our republic's history, the minimum pension almost equals the minimum food basket. And if we take into account the cashback program for seniors who make purchases with cards, then the minimum pension is higher than the basket. This is a historic mark.

In 1H2023, the tech sector's turnover +90%, the number of jobs +40%, the number of companies +70%.

##... Nagorno-Karabakh's role in peace talks

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh [NK] says it won't accept any diplomatic concessions made by Armenia. At the same time, they refuse to negotiate with Azerbaijan unless the latter ends the ongoing policies of ethnic cleansing. What's the solution?

**PASHINYAN:** Armenia cannot decide the fate of the Nagorno-Karabakh people. The representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh must be a party to negotiations. The safety and rights of the Nagorno-Karabakh people must be discussed in the presence of Nagorno-Karabakh representatives, with a direct dialogue with Azerbaijan through an international format. This format would allow the government of Nagorno-Karabakh to discuss the pressing issues. This would also put them in charge, and they would bear certain responsibilities.

It is yet to be decided whether the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace agreement will make any mention of Nagorno-Karabakh. Our position is that it should not. The NK-Azerbaijan issues should be discussed separately.

**REPORTER:** Last year you said that lowering the ""status"" bar would ensure an international consolidation around Armenia, yet the Lachin Corridor is closed today. Were you wrong?

**PASHINYAN:** The international community has, in fact, adopted a pro-Armenian stance. Verdicts and resolutions were adopted in the UN World Court, PACE, European Parliament, and statements were made by several UNSC members. This is obviously not enough, but you should understand that the statement about the need to lower the bar was first and foremost necessary for us [to prevent escalation].

##... Aghdam road

**REPORTER:** Brussels wants the Aghdam road to open in addition to the Lachin Corridor. Did you discuss the opening of this road in Brussels?

**PASHINYAN:** No. And I don't even have a mandate to discuss an Aghdam road. I do have the mandate to discuss the Lachin Corridor because it was formed by the Nov. 9 tripartite statement co-signed by me.  

**REPORTER:** So Charles Michel's post-meeting statement about the Aghdam road was NOT ""co-authored"" by you?

**PASHINYAN:** Correct. 

**REPORTER:** There are negotiations in Brussels, Washington, and Moscow. Is there a conflict between them?

**PASHINYAN:** No, because the negotiating parties remain the same: Armenia and Azerbaijan. The logic remains the same. These platforms complement each other.

##... the return of refugees 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan wants to discuss the ""return of ethnic Azeris who left Armenia"". What's your stance on it?
 
**PASHINYAN:** In response to our calls to ensure the rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, Azerbaijan wants to address the issue of Azeris who left Armenia after the fall of the USSR. Our response is that the topic of Azeris who lived in Armenia should be discussed under the context of Armenians who lived in Azerbaijan, for example, Baku and Sumgayit. The issue of Nagorno-Karabakh is entirely a separate topic, legally and conceptually.

The Nagorno-Karabakh refugee issues are regulated by the Nov. 9 document, which states that refugees and IDPs shall return to their homes with the help of the UN. This is about the return of Armenians to Shushi, Martuni, Hadrut, Askeran, Martakert, Getashen, and Shahumyan.

Separately, there is the question of the rights and security of the Armenian population outside of Karabkh, many of whom were massacred in Baku and Sumgayit. As for Azeris who lived in Armenia, we have evidence that many of them sold their homes and voluntarily left Armenia.

##... Armenia as a pawn 

**REPORTER:** Russia-Turkey relations are souring again. How will this affect Armenia?

**PASHINYAN:** What matters is whether the disagreements reach a point of hostility. I've mentioned the role of geopolitics in the opening statement.  

Throughout the entire history of our state, we acted within the logic of confrontation. This has been our biggest problem. It served as a barrier to our security and long-term development.

##... consulting with others

**REPORTER:** Are you willing to meet former presidents to discuss the negotiation process?

**PASHINYAN:** I'm not against it. As you may know, during the 2020 war the former presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh invited me to a meeting. I accepted it but they later canceled their participation.

##... Vardan Oskanian's ideas

**REPORTER:** Ex-MFA Vardan Oskanian has proposed some ideas.

**PASHINYAN:** I did not find anything practically useful in his proposal, or anything that hasn't already been done. 

For example, Oskanian says we must emphasize that Nagorno-Karabakh had a status of an Autonomous Oblast during USSR. He essentially copied the words of the president of the European Council, which were made after my meeting with Aliyev. In that meeting, we noted that Nagorno-Karabakh was an Autonomous Oblast in USSR. We reestablished the same during the latest meeting as well. So all of that was already done and publicized *before* Oskanian's proposal.

Everyone has ideas, and Oskanian had a decade to successfully execute his. I've spoken about Oskanian's negotiation record during the [War Commission session](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/14eypwv/tldr_pashinyan_reveals_details_from_the_2020/). 

##... Azerbaijan's maximalism 

**REPORTER:** For decades, Armenia was not ready to accept any solution without a status for Nagorno-Karabakh, while Azerbaijan rejected an independent status for Nagorno-Karabakh. It led to war. Are you concerned that we'll have another war soon, since we have a similar gridlock today? Today Armenia says the rights and security of NK people is a ""red line"", while Azerbaijan says it won't discuss any rights and security.  

**PASHINYAN:** At least around the negotiation table, Azerbaijan is not outright rejecting the idea of discussing the rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. On the other hand, the statements made by their public officials show unwillingness on their part. 

On the other hand, it baffles me when some in Nagorno-Karabakh outright reject the idea of holding direct talks with Azerbaijan to discuss that topic. It should be noted that others [Samvel Babayan] in Nagorno-Karabakh support such dialogue.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to recognize each other's territorial integrity, but that doesn't change the fact that the Nagorno-Karabakh issue is yet to be addressed. The parties don't trust each other. This is why the Stepanakert-Baku dialogue must take place through an international mechanism.

##... UN Security Council

**REPORTER:** Will you ask the UN Security Council to discuss Azerbaijan's refusal to follow the UN World Court's order on the unblocking of the Lachin Corridor?

**PASHINYAN:** We're working in that direction as well. We are in touch with permanent and non-permanent members of the UNSC. There are ongoing discussions. It only takes an hour for us to request the UNSC to intervene, but preparatory work is necessary to ensure the outcome is pro-Armenian. Don't forget that UNSC is also a political structure, they don't blindly execute World Court orders.

##... Russia annexes Nagorno-Karabakh? 🤔

**REPORTER:** Have you and your colleagues from Nagorno-Karabakh or Russia discussed the possibility of Nagorno-Karabakh becoming part of Russia? Is it realistic?

**PASHINYAN:** I've never held such discussions. [Body language indicates that *others* might have discussed that.]

**REPORTER:** Can you house 120,000 residents of Nagorno-Karabakh in Armenia if the Azerbaijani regime forcefully removes the population? How much would it cost, and how would you organize it?

**PASHINYAN:** There are no such discussions. It's about ensuring conditions for Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians to live in their homeland.  

##... peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh

**REPORTER:** Turkey wants the Russian peacekeepers to leave in 2025. Do you believe they will leave? What would happen then?

**PASHINYAN:** There is a *reason* why peacekeepers were deployed there. Russia's [security agencies] gave Putin the authority to deploy peacekeepers. These authorization documents state that peacekeepers are necessary to prevent mass killings of the local population. It was Putin who requested this authorization from the relevant structures to ""prevent mass killings"".

So if Russia decides to leave Nagorno-Karabakh now, does that mean there is no longer a threat of mass killings? This could be the case only if there was a successful NK-Azerbaijan direct dialogue under an international mechanism.

##... the government of Nagorno-Karabakh 

**REPORTER:** Lachin Corridor is closed. What can Armenia do to ensure Russia is following through with its duties?

**PASHINYAN:** We can always agree that Russia must do this, the world must do that, but is the government of Nagorno-Karabakh doing its part? Is there anything that Nagorno-Karabakh itself can do to end the crisis? I believe there is, and we are ready to assist them with that.

The Nagorno-Karabakh government must step forward and express resolute commitment to discuss with Azerbaijan the rights and security of Armenians, within an international mechanism.

I'm in touch with the president of Nagorno-Karabakh on a daily basis. 
The old world order is gone. We may expect other countries to intervene to help solve our problem, but these countries can't even solve their own problems today. 

##... opposition parties & Hayaqve

**REPORTER:** Some opposition parties are holding protests and expressing ideas against a peace treaty.

**PASHINYAN:** They may have noble intentions, but their policies would guarantee another 30 years of conflict and confrontational policies for Armenia, which we simply cannot afford. You have to realize that we were on the brink of losing our Republic after the 2020 war. It was saved almost miraculously. We got there because of confrontational policies. I personally have learned from these mistakes. 

**REPORTER:** The opposition wants to prohibit you from signing a ""treacherous peace agreement"". Are you willing to publish the peace agreement document, perhaps to tame the concerns?

**PASHINYAN:** The opposition has access to the so-called ""document"". I've invited them to read it behind closed doors. It's not a ""secret"" document, its logic has been publicized, but the negotiation papers cannot be published because 1) Diplomatic ethics, 2) Parts of them could change over time. You can't serve an uncooked dish.

The opposition refused to read it, knowing very well they wouldn't be able to call us traitors after reading it. You can't read it, see the pro-Armenian efforts, then publicly call it treacherous without subconsciously having a conflict with yourself.

**REPORTER:** Ex-president Serj Sargsyan wrote a letter to foreign leaders asking for assistance to lift the blockade. Do you support it? 

**PASHINYAN:** I support the concept, but it begins with a paragraph of complaint on how terrible the government of Armenia is. The reader might think the blockade is done by us, not Azerbaijan. It's shameful and counterproductive and discredits our cause. When I was an opposition figure I never allowed myself to badmouth our illegitimate leader while sending similarly themed letters to international colleagues.

**REPORTER:** The opposition wants to legally prohibit the Armenian government from recognizing Azerbaijan's territorial integrity on 86,600 km^2.

**PASHINYAN:** Banning Armenia from recognizing Azerbaijan's territorial integrity is the same as banning Azerbaijan from recognizing Armenia's territorial integrity. This is a guaranteed path to an armed conflict. There are figures in Armenia who do not care about Armenia's 29,800 mk^2, but I do. I am the prime minister of 29,800, not more or less. For many decades, including during my early years as PM, we blurred Armenia's independent statehood by ignoring our 29,800. Not anymore.

People who created and disseminated official maps that depicted Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding territories as part of Armenia were probably thinking they were on some kind of a positive historic quest. In reality, they were just smothering our statehood. 

People always make a toast for ""peace"" during gatherings, but the government has never given an honest explanation of how that peace could be achieved. We have always lied to our people. I've [revealed details from the negotiation history](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/14eypwv/tldr_pashinyan_reveals_details_from_the_2020/): Armenian government had adopted a strategy of deception during the negotiation process. What they promised to the public was unrealistic and unachievable from the very first day, let's say from the Lisbon conference. People were kept in the dark while the number of toasts kept increasing.

**REPORTER:** Do you have the authority to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan without hearing the public opinion?

**PASHINYAN:** We cannot decide the fate of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. Only they can decide their fate. I have the mandate to make decisions about the Republic of Armenia only, and my goal is to secure Armenia's 29,800 km^2 and the rights and freedoms of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians.

##... Putin recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan in December 2020  

**REPORTER:** Russia claims its hands are tied and it can't help end the Nagorno-Karabakh blockade because Armenia very recently ""recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan"". {Read the context [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/157qsy7/russia_washes_its_hands_off_from_the/). Analysts break down Russia's attempt to shift the blame to Armenia with disingenuous claims.}

**PASHINYAN:** I knew you would ask that, so I brought Vladimir Putin's statement made on 17 Dec 2020. Putin said: The international law says that all these territories belong to Azerbaijan. Armenia itself has not recognized the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh, so from the legal perspective, Nagorno-Karabakh is also part of Azerbaijan. //

Nevertheless, Russia sent peacekeepers because they concluded there was a threat of mass killings of civilians and mass damage to civilian infrastructure. These threats continue to exist. Armenia did not recognize Azerbaijan's territorial integrity on 6 Oct 2022. The Almaty Declaration has been part of Armenian law since 1992.

Was there *any* OSCE Minsk Group member that *didn't* recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan? None.

[Reads a pro-Azeri statement made by France's OSCE co-chair on 8 Jan 2020.]

[Reads a statement made by U.S. State Department in 2012-2016: With the help of Armenia, the separatists continue to control the majority of Nagorno-Karabakh and 7 other territories of Azerbaijan.]

There was a time, there was a geopolitical era, when Armenia's strategy was to ignore the international community's opinion and pursue its own policy. We had a bitter wake-up call. Are we in a position go against the whole world today? 

We should not always run to world powers and ask them to help resolve our problems. That is not always the best option. So is the government of Nagorno-Karabakh doing its part to decide its own fate?  

[Russia shifting the blame on Armenia] is in reality them complaining about Armenia's 30-year history of making ""too many phone calls"" to Moscow with requests for help. How long are we going to send a ""letter to the Russian tsar""? Moscow and the world have their own problems today. The Republic of Armenia must mature and learn to address its own problems. 

##... ""competing"" negotiation platforms

**REPORTER:** Describe the ""competition"" between Washington, Brussels, and Moscow.

**PASHINYAN:** The negotiating parties remain the same: Armenia and Azerbaijan. The content is also the same. The platform host, be it Moscow or Washington, occasionally offer ideas when they notice that the parties are unable to come to an agreement over something, over a wording or a phrase. There is no conflict between the hosts in this regard. 

If you've noticed, in the beginning, the West and Russia were highly critical of one another's platform. But recently the rhetoric has changed [Moscow said it welcomes Brussels meeting]. They say they welcome any platform that contributes towards reaching an agreement. It's a small detail but a noticeable one.

##... neighbors > West and Russia 

**REPORTER:** During an interview with France-Presse you said that Armenia is not between West and East, but rather between Georgia, Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkey. Does that mean Armenia will pursue the localization/regionalization of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict? What will be the role of the regional 3+3 platform? Does that mean the diminishing of Western positions?

**PASHINYAN:** Of course not. You started by accurately citing my statement but then drifted away with incorrect assumptions. We are not pushing the West out of the region. Have you noticed that most of the negotiations this year took place on Western platforms? That is also because Russia is preoccupied with the Ukraine conflict; we are not pushing Russia out.

My statement was about better understanding who we are and *where* we are. For too long we've acted as if there is only Armenia, West, and Russia. But that isn't true. We don't even have a border with Russia. We can't get there without using the land/air of one of our neighbors. The same about the West.

We don't even have direct access to the global internet. It needs to travel through Georgia or another neighbor... at least until we have full access to a satellite network. 

We shouldn't overly rely on the West or Russia to solve our problems. Serj Sargsyan was boasting that ""I'm not negotiating with Azerbaijan, I'm negotiating with the OSCE Misnk Co-Chairs"", as if that was a good thing. ""Who the hell is Azerbaijan for me to talk to them?"" 

Serj will come and go, Nikol will come and go, but the people of Armenia will remain neighbors with Azeris, not with Russians or French. We are trying to build a sustainable future for Armenia. 

God forbid Yevgeny Prigozhin's coup lasted not 1.5 days but 1.5 months, are you sure the peacekeepers would remain in Nagorno-Karabakh? The events of the early 20th century could play out again.


##... OCSE Minks Gorup

**REPORTER:** Last year Russia's OSCE co-chair Khovayev presented a proposal but the efforts to reach an agreement with Azerbaijan failed. Has anything changed since then? Any new proposals by Khovayev?

**PASHINYAN:** No. The position of Russia and the West are closer than ever. 

**REPORTER:** Aliyev claims he has information about efforts to revive the OSCE Minsk Group.  

**PASHINYAN:** ...

**REPORTER:** ...

**PASHINYAN:** What is your question?

**REPORTER:** Dat you?

**PASHINYAN:** Armenia is taking steps to maximize the effectiveness of the negotiations. The Minsk Group was never actually dissolved. The Western and Russian co-chairs refused to meet each other after the events in Ukraine. The freezing wasn't because of changes in our region. They can decide to resume their meetings at any time. There might be certain processes ""outside"" of Armenia and Azerbaijan.

##... Nikol = traitor

**REPORTER:** People want to know why you don't use the word ""Artsakh"" anymore. Why do you use ""Nagorno-Karabakh""? Why are you avoiding the Armenian name?

**PASHINYAN:** We signed a tripartite statement on Nov. 9 that established ""Nagorno-Karabakh"", gave it borders, and a corridor. Soon after, Azerbaijan claimed there was no such thing called Nagorno-Karabakh. Miraculously, some people in Armenia have since adopted Azerbaijan's position. 

Use ""Artsakh"", why don't you say ""Artsakh""... What exactly is ""Artsakh""? Does anyone outside Armenia even know what ""Artsakh"" is? We are struggling to convince the world that Nagorno-Karabakh exists, that's the term they recognize, and you want us to stop using that term now?  Artsakh's own Constitution refers to the country as ""Nagorno-Karabakh"".  

Did we not sign a paper that establishes the borders of a territory called ""Nagorno-Karabakh""?  

Or is this noise being raised so that some folks can make even more patriotic toasts? Some ""dear comrades"" continue with their myths about ""unbreakable"" this and that. Don't make me remind you every day that long traffic lines had formed to leave Stepanakert on the second day of the war. Do you know how many of these ""patriotic toast-makers"" were fleeing at the speed of 300 km/h?

**REPORTER:** A resident of Artsakh accuses you of surrendering 80% of their homeland and Shushi. Why don't you resign?

**PASHINYAN:** 1) I've already resigned, and was reelected. 2) 80% of *whose* homeland? Because Serj Sargsyan was claiming that the 7 regions surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh were never his homeland: ""Aghdam was not our homeland"" - Serj Sargsyan. 3) There are criminal charges and a primary suspect in the case of the fall of Shushi, and there might be more.  

**REPORTER:** A resident of Nagorno-Karabakh criticizes your wife for sharing food pictures on social media, and blames you for the blockade.

**PASHINYAN:** Save the cheap propaganda so I won't be forced to remind you about this every time: During the difficult days of the war you couldn't find many male and female residents in Stepanakert, so my wife went there to coordinate humanitarian efforts for those hiding in bomb shelters. You should have seen the number of able-bodied male residents from Nagorno-Karabakh enjoying their time in Yerevan restaurants in the middle of the war. So I advise you not to bring up this topic ever again. I know which former president is behind this propaganda and why.

My wife recently posted images of vegetables grown in our backyard. You can grow tomatoes, eggplant, and okra in Nagorno-Karabakh, too. She didn't do it to show off a ""good life"" while others sit under a blockade. It was a basic vegetable soup from our garden.

My administration sent large quantities of aid to Nagorno-Karabakh to help the government of Nagorno-Karabakh to maintain agriculture and pay pensions and state salaries. Is it the tomato from our backyard that rattled some people? 

[Kocharyan's ally and Nagorno-Karabakh ""hero"" Vitali Balasanyan] was arrested in Nagorno-Karabakh a week ago. It was also reported that he possessed a whole bunch of donated goods that were stolen instead of being sent to frontline soldiers during the 2016 war. *[Balasanyan allegedly kept stashes of stolen cigarettes and began to sell them to the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh at a marked-up price during the blockade.]* Do you really want to teach me patriotism by bringing these ""heroes"" as an example? Balasanyan [his son] reportedly took funds from the Nagorno-Karabakh budget [distributed as aid from Armenia], and allegedly some cash from Azerbaijan to fix an electrical transformer. Where did the money go?

If there are no eggplants in Nagorno-Karabakh today, then what happened to the hundreds of millions of dollars in aid sent from Armenia? Can the public officials in Stepanakert explain? Was it not possible to take care of food reserves? 

There are way too many ""heroes"". These ""heroes"" struck 50/50 deals with Azerbaijan [to co-manage source resources], but somehow I am the one that's Turkish agent, while they are the hero. 

Did you know that [Nagorno-Karabakh government, through a delegation led by Vitali Balasanyan] negotiated with Russia and Azerbaijan, *without* a prior agreement with Armenia, to shut down the original Lachin road? [not to be confused with the new road blockaded by Azerbaijan] 

It was the government of Armenia that had to bear the burden and consequences of their decision. Was it also us who committed that ""treason""? 

Too many officials are acting as bloggers today. Should have planted eggplants instead of livestreaming. These livestreamers were livesteaming from Yerevan during the war while my wife was doing the work in Stepanakert. 

It is unacceptable for certain officials from the Nagorno-Karabakh government to organize road closures in Yerevan. 

It is incomprehensible how much wealth certain former presidents have accumulated. Did Robert Kocharyan inherit a few hundred million dollars from his grandfather's silk factory? Or did it come from party membership fees? [Context: Prosecutors have launched a massive asset forfeiture case against Kocharyan's family.] 

The bottom line is, eating eggplant is now considered treason in Armenia...

##... autonomy, self-determination

**REPORTER:** Ex-MFA Vardan Oskanian, an experienced diplomat, believes it's still possible to protect Artsakh's self-determination and autonomy. 

**PASHINYAN:** Did I get it right that Oskanian mentioned self-determination and *autonomy*? But those are conflicting terms in this context. One day Oskanian wants to criminalize any recognition of Karabakh within Azerbaijan, and the following day he supports Karabakh within Azerbaijan. Because in this case, autonomy means being part of Azerbaijan. 

Vardan Oskanian was our lead negotiator [even under Levon Ter-Petrosyan]. I published the Lisbon papers during the War Commission session. In the statement made by the Lisbon conference president, the right to self-determination was presented as an autonomy *within* Azerbaijan. So a question arises, does Oskanian accept that the true logic of his negotiation process was to grant Karabakh autonomy within Azerbaijan, and that the ""experienced diplomat"" Oskanian was unable to accomplish even *that*? This is the logic of the Lisbon statement vetoed by Armenia: ""Karabakh can realize its right to self-determination by having autonomy within Azerbaijan.""

Our public was made to believe that ""self-determination"" meant ""independence"". That just wasn't the case.

My stance is that we don't have the right to pre-determine the fate of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. The representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh must take direct part in this process. They must negotiate with Azerbaijan under an international mechanism.

##... secession for salvation

**REPORTER:** Your 2021 electoral campaign supported Nagorno-Karabakh's self-determination under the principle of ""secession for salvation"". 

**PASHINYAN:** Our current policies toward the protection of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians do not contradict the idea of secession for salvation. All these years, the term ""self-determination"" used during the negotiation process meant a ""status within Azerbaijan"". Today, if Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh can prove and convince the international community that Azerbaijan is carrying out a policy of ethnic cleansing/genocide, then the principle of secession for salvation can activate. Is that clear now? 


##... armament

**REPORTER:** French Senate leader has urged the French government to ""expedite"" the process of supplying weapons to Armenia. Does that mean there is already an agreement to acquire French weapons?

**PASHINYAN:** Work is underway to diversify Armenia's security needs. I cannot disclose anything more. MOD Papikyan recently visited France. I consider his meetings successful and I hope it will bring some results.

And it does it quite effectively - even many people that dislike Aliyev claim that he is the only person who can handle external powers, and that without his diplomatic skills our country would be torn apart. 

But what do we see in reality? Armenia has considerably better relationships with Russia than we do. It also has considerably better ties with the West, and considerably better ties with Iran. Meanwhile  our relationships with ALL of these powers is only worsening. That's what we got from 'ingenious' external policy of Aliyev. All those statements that Aliyev “Is irreplacable because he is wise politician and only one who can balance among Russia, Iran and the West"" are just a propaganda, Aliyev’s regime is so rotten that it is unable to institute effective external policy, everything it can do is to bribe foreign officials, but as we can see it doesn’t work. I believe any average, normal democratically elected president would establish better diplomacy than Aliyev and his regime."

- Mullahs only care about their own survival and continuation of the grip of Shī'ism and Islam in Iranian plateau and anywhere they can lay their hands on as has been so in these 1400 years.  

First mistake is to think they care about the ""nation-sate"" of Iran or any forces that could weaken it as we saw how they wasted billions of dollars, natural and human resources of the country to pursue their ideology in the region in these 50 years.

- IRI considered Nagorno-Karabakh the land of Islam. For proof, you can look for the statements of the local Mullahs of the NW provinces about the conflict back in 2020 and their support for ""Muslim Azeris"". Despite what propagandists from Baku regime like to claim, IRI did not help Armenia in 2020 war otherwise it was in their power to not let Aliev advance.  

Second mistake one could commit is falling for Ankara-Baku propaganda.

- IRI apparently told Aliev that Armenia proper is off-limits but they have already invaded parts of Armenia proper! We'll see how it goes but Baku has no reason to stop its advancement when they're on a victory streak and the regional politics is favorable for them. Russia is busy in its own invasion of Ukraine. US is on decline, discussing whether there are 10 genders or 12. Europe needs RoA's gas. Israel is doing all it can to threaten IRI in its northern borders and it's funny how everyone ignores Israel's role in this. They airlifted Baku all sorts of weapons while EU, US and even Ruzzia were conveniently silent about it.
  
Third mistake is not realizing that this is a one time opportunity for Baku to form a land connection to Nakhchivan and thinking they would risk losing it. 

I think the future is a bit worrisome for Iranians as we can expect a possible war in northern regions and IRI welcomes it for many reasons.

I hope no war happens."

In other words, 56% of the 193 countries in the world excl. NATO are seeking to import Iranian drones. I don't know about y'all but I was pretty astonished when reading that.

Naturally, these developments are a direct consequence of the massive success Iranian drones have brought about the Russians in Ukraine.

EDIT: I am disappointed in RAND which usually has some useful publications. I looked into the source being cited in that claim. [\[105\]](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20230209-iran-to-supply-china-with-15000-drones-official-says/) The source is Middle East Monitor which, in turn, cited ""Iran International"" which is an anti-Iranian propaganda network previously funded by Saudi Arabia (it's unknown whether they are still funding it).

On the other hand, it is important to note that the claim about Iranian drones having massive success on the battlefield leading to many sales it true, but the figure is exaggerated."
10/15/2023,The Peanut Gallery: 10/14/23,"Welcome to the [Peanut Gallery](https://reddit.com/r/TheNuttySpectacle)! Your daily dose of unfounded speculation.  

For newcomers, this is an amateur's take on the ISW daily bullet points. I know nothing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Israel:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Clashes in the West Bank between Israeli forces and Palestinian militias decreased after peaking on October 13. Hamas remains committed to expanding the war to the West Bank, however.

First good news we've heard all week. 

The Islamic world runs on tribes (outsider's perspective). They aren't united by nationality in the way we are, rather they're united by shared beliefs, just look at the grab-bag of acronyms. There's ISIS, Hamas, Taliban, Fatah-ma-whatever, Hezbollah...it's just an endless list of organizations which maintain effective sovereignty devoid of a state. In Mexico they're called 'cartels'. Here in the States we call 'em 'militias'. They're just angry people with guns. 

Nothing unites these disparate groups like shared passion. But the thing about passion is that it burns hot and goes away quick. Every day that passes without Israel invading Gaza is another day their building movement has to peter out. Hamas must secure the support of the average Palestinians because without them Hamas is nothing. 

That's why Hamas is hiding behind civilians: they want--no, *need* the propaganda win. Desperately. The entire system hinges on Israel making a mess in Gaza. Without that, without the narrative of 'genocide', it's impossible for Hamas to unite the Arab world. 

This is why I firmly believe Israel should perform an extended siege, delaying entering Gaza proper for as long as possible. We can get the civilians out later. We can feed and water and house them with ease. But we can't put the genie back in the bottle if this war spreads. If we deny Hamas the propaganda win they crave, then Arabs might not buy in and Iran will be forced to deescalate. 

>Lebanese Hezbollah claimed attacks on the IDF for the second consecutive day as part of its ongoing harassment of Israeli forces. LH messaging indicates that the group will conduct additional attacks against Israeli forces in the coming days.

Seeing the shit Israel has to deal with? You know what? I get it. Everyone in the area seems to want nothing more than to exterminate every Israeli man, woman, and child. Their neighbors are lobbing rockets with impunity. Given a century of that shit I'd probably be willing to stick people in camps myself. 

>Iran and elements of its Axis of Resistance are messaging that the Hamas-Israel war could expand geographically into a multi-front conflict. CTP-ISW is closely monitoring the situation to forecast whether such a scenario is becoming more or less likely.

They're doing more than 'messaging', they're directly threatening Israel if it enters the city. 

America and Britain, meanwhile, are mostly quiet in regards to Iran's involvement. I think it's the right move. Diplomatically it deescalates by refraining from blame, while in terms of the information war it leaves Iran to echo into the void. 

The West said its piece. Our response is enclosed in two super-heavy aircraft carriers and a sizable portion of the Royal Navy. What happens next is up to Iran. 

>Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abdollahian traveled to Qatar, likely to meet with Hamas leadership and discuss Iranian financial assets with Qatari officials.

Iran really cares about that six billion and change. It's kind of telling--first, because it's America's currency; it only has value because America says it does, so by valuing our money Iran buys into America's hegemony. Second, because it's not actually a lot of money, relatively speaking. It's 0.1% of my government's annual operating budget. Pocket change. And the Ayatollah is acting like some college kid rooting around in the couch to round out this month's rent. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ukraine:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>US and Ukrainian officials reported on October 12 and 13 that they anticipated the Russian offensive operations around Avdiivka and expressed confidence in Ukrainian defenses.

By all accounts this offensive is so overwhelmingly disastrous that it might have already culminated. Russia doesn't seem to be going anywhere, and they're attempting human wave tactics through minefields, so the exchange rate is likely awful. It's been four, five days of this now? And I still don't get it. 

>The Russian information space remains divided on the prospects of Russian successes near Avdiivka and on current Ukrainian capabilities.

ISW space says 'divided' but what it really means is 'cracked'. There is a clear and present party line the milibloggers know to follow. On day one through three they followed it, but lately some of them are expressing doubts. The longer the Kremlin goes without either tangible progress or a good ol' fashioned crackdown, the louder these voices will become. 

>Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in eastern and southern Ukraine on October 14 and advanced west of Donetsk City.

I saw a [video](https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1713293503172653219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1713293503172653219%7Ctwgr%5Ecb1ade418203695a5e4fd71877176ffdf0dcd53e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fliveupdate%2F18hnzysb1elcs%2FLiveUpdate_b5da8bc6-6ae5-11ee-b799-266edc659bda%2F0) today of like five Russians surrendering in a trench. I think it's fair to say shit's going pretty good. 

>The Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) will maintain some vessels at its main Sevastopol naval base amid Ukrainian strikes on Russian vessels, as the Russian Navy’s main dry dock on the Black Sea is in Sevastopol.

Missing from this headline is that Ukraine managed to hit two ships of the BSF over the last day or so. Also, that apparently Russia is only keeping ships in Sevastopol because they don't have enough docks at their backup facilities. 

>Armenia ratified the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) Rome Statute on October 14, obliging Armenia to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin if he enters Armenia due to the ICC’s outstanding arrest warrant, directly after Putin’s efforts on October 13 to claim that the Russia-Armenia relationship is not deteriorating.

Lmao. Fucking savage. 

>Ukrainian forces will reportedly begin training on F-16 fighter jets in the US next week.

4/25/2021,The US Presidents Recognition Of The So Called Genocide Is Positive News Everyone!,"I believe this was a good indicator for great many of things.

1- This thing was like Democles' sword on top of our neck every year and they wasted this trump card in a very weak way. They used it in a time where everyone knew the US and Turkey fell off politically, when the US was also accusing China of genocide, when they were going at each other with Russia. They did it just after kicking Turkey out of F-35 programme.

So everyone sensible is aware the US is a country that exploits historical-humanitarian events for its political interests. They just over exposed themselves. Maybe if they did this in a more calm, convenient time it would have been a massive hit to Turkey.

2- Them never using the word was sth that whipped up the Armenian diaspora and in fact kept them intact. Sort of like a ''great cause'' for them. Because everyone knows, the best thing to maintain a group together is giving them a common target. Now they got what they wanted. I read in the Armenian sub once, after this they will chase the recognition of ''Artsakh'' but that can be nowhere near close to replacing this.

3- In fact the US not recognising it made it a debated topic in the US media and because of this it actually had an opposite effect of more people getting exposed to their propaganda.

Since the US president ''recognised it''(whatever that means, f\*\*\*ing guy with a dementia cant even show where Armenia is on the map) they will talk about it 2-3 days not even that much and they will move on.

Now of course they will continue to ''protest'' Turkish government but the campaigns to make the president say the word will at least cease. They will live their honeymoon. After the honeymoon, life continues.

4- This is also a good implication about how the US is out of moves towards Turkey. This was them getting very low. They at last weaponised history to annoy us. Previously they did sanctions, they hit our defense industry, they arranged a coup, they continuously support PKK&YPG, they supported Greece in East Mediterranian and Aegean seas even built a base in Dedeagac, even their Gulenist accounts made anti-Turkey propaganda 7/24, they didnt sell patriots and they kicked us off the F-35 programme, they choked their public to anti-Turkish sentiments and propaganda. They did all of that and we although crippled for all of it, somehow survived every one of them.

They dont even care about their reputation within Turkish public. They are well aware it is beyond repairable. They are(and their vassals within our country) beyond exposed for their intentions.

What should we do?

We need to keep it cool and continue what we do as if nothing happened. We should continue growing our defense industry, we should continue our operations in Iraq and Syria. We should continue our policy of stabilising Middle East with only the countries in it.

We shouldnt quit Nato. We have the right to veto in Nato. We should stay in it and veto any potential applications from Cyprus.

We should continue to cooperate with Azerbaijan and never open borders with Armenia. We are lucky we are the ones that matter in this geography. Their voices may be high in the states but the states dont matter in here. We are the reality of this geography."

My main question now is, why do religious people not accept science? if there is mathematical proves to where everything comes from, why don’t religious people believe it? like do you think science is propaganda or something? we believe that god created everything (and i don’t question that) but there is also evidence to how/when things were create.

Azerbaijan has turned Nagorno-Karabakh into an open-air ghetto. The power grid was shut off by Azerbaijani soldiers after the capturing of civilian settlements and infrastructure. 

The Lachin corridor remains closed to travelers and unobstructed aid, despite the World Court's order for Azerbaijan to open it.

Azerbaijani soldiers have set up roadblocks on all major arteries and opened fire at vehicles passing through inner roads in Nagorno-Karabakh (e.g. at peacekeepers), making it impossible for residents to safely travel to nearby concentration camps where they could receive some amount of food and assistance.

Thousands of civilians spent last night under open air in a dysfunctional airport near the capital. Azerbaijan has long threatened to shoot down any non-peacekeeping aircraft that lands or departs the airport.

Armenia has called for the deployment of UN-mandated peacekeepers and an international fact-finding mission in Nagorno-Karabakh.

##Washington Post article by ex-chief prosecutor at ICC Luis Moreno Ocampo: ""Call what is happening in Nagorno-Karabakh by its proper name""

>In international law, the Genocide Convention of 1948 makes it clear that one way to commit the crime is by “deliberately inflicting on [a] group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part” (Article II c). By blocking the Lachin Corridor, Aliyev turned Nagorno-Karabakh into a vast concentration camp for 120,000 Armenians. This week’s military intervention added killing (Article II a) and causing serious bodily and mental harm (Article II b) to the ledger.

>The world must call the crime by its proper name. Resistance to using the term “genocide” has been a long-standing problem in international affairs. In April 1994, most U.N. Security Council members refused to label the mass killings in Rwanda as genocide. Little has changed in 30 years.

>Azerbaijan’s ambitions extend beyond Nagorno-Karabakh. Since 2010, Aliyev has regularly talked about Armenia itself as “Western Azerbaijan,” echoing long-standing Azerbaijani claims that Armenia as a whole is an illegitimate state. As recently as December, he said that “present-day Armenia is our land.”

##the surrender of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh could allow Russia to collect thousands of heavy and light weaponry and use them against Ukraine

Azerbaijan and Russia have forced Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians to lay down their arms. Thousands of pieces of weapons have already been surrendered. Russia claims the loot will be transferred to Azerbaijan but some believe they will end up using them against Ukraine. Interview with analyst Hovsep Khurshudyan:

**REPORTER:** What can you tell us about the UNSC session?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** It helped us understand each country's position and the changes since the last session. The process of holding a session itself serves as a preventative and restraining measure. FM Mirzoyan's statement was very harsh this time, with some scolding language aimed at the UNSC over its prior inaction.  

**REPORTER:** Did the countries change their rhetoric?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Some Armenians have interpreted the speeches by France and the U.S. as milder, but that is not the case. This time the U.S. urged for an international mission to be dispatched to Nagorno-Karabakh. This is a new element. 

It's still necessary to convert speech into action. It won't be easy because Azerbaijan and Russia will resist the entry of an international mission into Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia brags that its peacekeepers are successfully handling the situation. This claim was bolstered by the advertisement of the death of several peacekeepers.

On the other hand, Germany has joined Armenia. If during the previous session Azerbaijan had Turkey while Armenia had the EU, this time Armenia had the EU and Germany.

Germany was represented by a ranking official: the foreign minister. She gave a strongly anti-Azerbaijan speech. This was followed by German PM Scholz accusing Azerbaijan of breaking its promises not to attack. This was a blow to Azerbaijan's reputation as a trustworthy actor.

China gave a negative speech and promoted Russia's stance that this is an Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. They are dragging Armenia into this.

We had a better chance of a resolution after the previous UNSC session but we saw a cautious approach at the time. For example, the U.S. was afraid that the adoption of a resolution would prompt Azerbaijan to abandon peace talks and attack. But this was a miscalculation because that attack ended up occurring regardless. 

Today we should focus on the possibility of sending an international mission to Nagorno-Karabakh, the framework of NK-AZ negotiations, and the continuation of AM-AZ negotiations. 

The Yevlakh negotiations haven't ended yet but we already see images of Nagorno-Karabakh soldiers surrendering weapons. We don't even know what their final destination is. It's possible that Russia will take them to Ukraine. It's unfortunate that it was impossible for Nagorno-Karabakh to use this equipment for self-defense. 

**REPORTER:** Could Russia actually do it?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Very much possible. Russia has always viewed Nagorno-Karabakh as a tool to promote its interests and not as a homeland of people who need protections secured under the Nov. 9 agreement.

What is the Kremlin's message to Armenians today? If you don't overthrow Pashinyan, there will be a genocide. We just need the Kremlin to admit that they will be the organizers if their orders aren't carried out in Yerevan.

As one famous Russian writer once said, Russia is a land of lords and slaves. Armenia is the slave. This is how the Kremlin views relations with other states. We saw this in Ukraine, too. Fellow Slavic Ukrainians suddenly became ""Benderite fascists"".

**REPORTER:** Will the pro-Russian opposition be able to remove Pashinyan?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Not without a foreign intervention. They were hoping for Pashinyan to drag Armenia into this conflict so Armenia could sustain losses, spelling doom for Pashinyan. 

**REPORTER:** During the UNSC session, Germany stated that no foreign power should attempt to destabilize democracy in Armenia. Are they referring to ongoing pro-Russian protests?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Isn't it obvious? The only person from the Russian regime who hasn't openly supported the protests yet is Vladimir Putin himself.

**REPORTER:** For the first time, the FM of Armenia called for the deployment of UN-mandated peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. Is this realistic after Nagorno-Karabakh has agreed to surrender arms?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Quite the contrary. The disarming of the Nagorno-Karabakh army would contribute to the deployment of UN-mandated peacekeepers because they are more defenseless now. FM Mirzoyan called for UN-mandated peacekeepers but did not specify from which country or countries. Will they be Russians but now with a mandate or a mixed contingent? Not specifying was the right decision.

##analyst Stepan Grigoryan about the UNSC session 

**STEPAN:** I have received information through diplomatic channels that the U.S. and France are currently discussing possible scenarios for a resolution and response. What we saw on Sept. 21st was the public phase. Afterward, the UNSC members hold private meetings. They are currently holding talks with various UN observers and fact-finding missions about sending a mission to Nagorno-Karabakh.

There seems to be a consensus that Germany gave the strongest speech. But Germany was invited as a guest. We should focus on the states whose signature will play a decisive role. Today France and the U.S. are working together. Germany's stance will be a positive influence.

##interview with VOMA military camp leader Vova Vartanov: Azerbaijan wanted the disarmament of Nangorno-Karabakh army but at the same time did not allow the removal of tanks from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, fearing it would strengthen Armenia

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh has agreed to lay down the arms. What will be the consequences?

**VOVA:** Having your own defense army is a lot better than relying on peacekeepers from any country because they have always proven themselves to be biased.

Azeri army regularly fires at our [Republic of Armenia] soldiers who attempt to conduct engineering work on the AM-AZ border. But engineering work doesn't have to be done only at the frontline. We need a second line of defense 1-2 kilometers deep. This wasn't done in Nagorno-Karabakh so Azeris were able to break through the line on the first day. 

There are some idiot politicians in Armenia who are against building this second line of defense. Two weeks ago, one politician referred to VOMA's efforts to build reinforced structures as ""treason"" because he thought we intended to surrender the territories between the 1st and 2nd lines. 

The lines need some depth. This was missing in the Martuni-Askeran-Stepanakert juncture in Nagorno-Karabakh. That's where Azerbaijan's first strike was. They wanted to split the Nagorno-Karabakh army into three. Some Nagorno-Karabakh soldiers went to the mountains afterward. I won't rule out there are still resistance fights.

**REPORTER:** Did Nagorno-Karabakh have enough power to resist?

**VOVA:** They could have resisted for a long time had they not been split into pieces and if they had better logistics. It would be possible to put up a strong resistance in the forests and mountains as well. But for that, they needed education and reinforced defense lines.

**REPORTER:** Did Nagorno-Karabakh have enough weapons to resist?

**VOVA:** Approximately half of Armenia's weapons were left in Nagorno-Karabakh. Per capita, there were more weapons and ammunition to defend 120,000 residents of Nagorno-Karabakh than 3 million residents of Armenia. They had up to 150 tanks in Nagorno-Karabakh. Our ""friend"" Russia will soon take them away. 

**REPORTER:** What will be the fate of those tanks?

**VOVA:** According to the media, Russia is supposed to collect them.

**REPORTER:** Could Russia use them against Ukraine?

**VOVA:** Who cares? The Ukrainian government has been anti-Armenia. They aren't pro-Azerbaijan either, they just ""like"" Azerbaijani-related online posts. 

**REPORTER:** What other weapons did Nagorno-Karabakh have?

**VOVA:** Many other types. Our so-called ""friends"" will soon collect them and announce the numbers.

**REPORTER:** Did Armenia have an army in Nagorno-Karabakh?

**VOVA:** No. [Way before this attack] Armenia had reached an agreement to accept 56 tanks that were to be removed by Russia from Nagorno-Karabakh. 

I won't rule out that the Lachin blockade began due to disagreements around the Nagorno-Karabakh armament. At the time, there was an agreement to move 50+ tanks to Armenia. This would have made Armenia stronger. Azerbaijan probably didn't like it and maintained a blockade. There was already an agreement to transfer the weapons. 

**REPORTER:** Does that mean Armenia was the one disarming Nagorno-Karabakh?

**VOVA:** It's not that simple. Nagorno-Karabakh had an excessive number of tanks. Too many isn't always better. Their transfer would have significantly helped one of the Army Corpses in Armenia. I suspect this was the primary reason why the blockade began.

**REPORTER:** Did Russian peacekeepers do anything when the attack began?

**VOVA:** They aren't allowed to shoot unless there is a direct threat to them. About 5 peacekeepers stood by 15 Nagorno-Karabakh defense soldiers and helped them defend one of the assaulted positions for an entire day.

**REPORTER:** Several peacekeepers were ambushed and killed by an accident. 

**VOVA:** It can't be an accident. The vehicle was clearly marked as non-Armenian. You don't ""accidentally"" shoot everyone inside. They were just trying to send a message. My issue isn't with Russian peacekeepers on the ground, my issue is with the Kremlin.

The 102nd Russian military base in Armenia should have immediately been dispatched to assist Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. They should have defended their own citizens [peacekeepers] in Nagorno-Karabakh. De jure this would have been a neutral act, separate from AM-RU or NK-RU relations. But Russia didn't even do that, proving that they are an ally on paper only. They sometimes even refuse to counter anti-Armenian decisions made by Azerbaijan or Turkey.  

Russian propagandists and the peddlers of this propaganda, such as  Dmitri Medvedev, are lying when they claim this is all the fault of one person *[Nikol]*. If this was about one person, Russia could find a way to replace him. Putin could defend Armenia, raise his own reputation in Armenia, and then urge Armenians to appoint a pro-Russian candidate of his choice. Grateful Armenian public would rush to support Putin's chosen candidate.

In reality, Russia has different interests. They need Turkey. That's why they've reached an agreement with Erdogan. They are building a gas hub to bypass the Western embargo. Russia needs BABLO more than it needs Armenia. Russia loves gaslighting while Medvedev loves going KRUTIT.  

**REPORTER:** Is this it? Is this the end of the road for Artsakh?

**VOVA:** Learn from Azeris. They were asking the same question in 1994. Now it's our turn to exercise and repeat ""Artsakh bizimdir"".

##тот, кто больше врет, получит половину Кремля

Pashinyan's chief of staff has accused Russian state propagandists of intentionally promoting fake news to destabilize the situation in Armenia. 

He brought the example of a report claiming that several protesters were able to break into the Government building where they supposedly discovered a group of U.S. special forces preparing to defend Nikol.

He singled out the propagandists who are ethnic Armenian: Margo Simonyan, Tigran Keosayan, Aram Gabrielyanov, Semyon Baghdasarov, Roman Babayan, Sergey Kurghinyan, and Andranik Mihranyan.

##several trucks brought humanitarian aid to Nagorno-Karabakh

Hundreds of tons of food and other items entered Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia with the support of peacekeepers and Red Cross organizations.

Azerbaijan said it will send 2 trucks with fuel via the Agdam route. Azerbaijan has intentionally cut off the supply of gas and electricity to Nagorno-Karabakh for 10 months in an attempt to make it impossible for ethnic Armenians to live in their homes.

11/15/2022,How do we organize the diaspora politically? From an information standpoint,"I am not happy with how Israel is treating Palestinians; however, I am impressed with how well organized the Jewish diaspora is. Without the Jewish-American lobby, Israel probably would not be as well funded and well defended as it is today (please challenge me if this is not true).

&#x200B;

What can we do to improve education online about the troubles that Armenia is going through?

What can we do to combat Azerbaijan propaganda? We are up against a well-funded dictatorship that [employs botnets](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/13/facebook-azerbaijan-ilham-aliyev) and has a [network of bribed diplomats worldwide.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_laundromat)

&#x200B;

I suggest we settle on bullet-proof messages that have citations. For instance, I have seen a bot on this subreddit which posts a very well written post on the genocide, that is sourced (and not just by Armenian scholars but by historians at large).

If we can consolidate our message we might be able to control the discourse better.

I've posted the images below as an example of messages that I think are really tight.

For instance, on reddit I often see news posts about Artsakh/NKR or about Azerbaijan/Armenia and they often play a both-sidesism/false equivalency. Let's not pretend that Armenians are not saints but it's obvious that by any measure Armenia is the less powerful nation (resources, diplomatic sway, GDP, population, allies).

&#x200B;

This isn't just about borders.

This isn't just about self-determination.

It's quite literally about survival.

10/29/2020,"Google ""armenia,"" and a majority of front-page news is pro-Azeri. Search ""armenia"" on Twitter, and you'll get the same thing, but MUCH worse. So what hope is there for the truth to surface?","""If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.""

Twitter is a cesspool at the moment, with all kinds of pro-Azeri propaganda drowning out every discussion of Armenia. About an hour ago, Carlotta Gall published her third (!!!) pro-Azeri piece, this time on Barda. A few more weeks of this, and people will come to believe that we are in fact the instigators in this war. Nobody remembers Azerbaijan's [threat to turn us into a second Chernobyl](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2020/07/17/threat-of-chernobyl-style-catastrophe-in-caucasus-drone-war/#514d87e37946), for example."
9/21/2023,My thoughts,"What happened was a catastrophe in its entirety. This literally renders the deaths of the soldiers who gave their lives for Artsakh in the 90s useless.

&#x200B;

I can blame Pashinyan but the truth is that he was elected by the people. Even if you think that he faked the election, he still has significant support, and this is something that can only happen in a failed society.

&#x200B;

I can somewhat understand the Armenian people falling for his propaganda in 2020 but the fact that Nikol Pashinyan is breathing air implies that the people are retarded. If not for Pashinyan, another retarded politician would've taken advantage and fucked everything up.

&#x200B;

This type of society in my opinion can only recover from a dictatorship rule which has everything in the country on lock to dispel any degeneracy or garbage in the country.

&#x200B;

My prediction: Some retard will take power and Armenia will shrink further in size/population, possibly fully. Only a literal miracle would prevent this and an actual revolution.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also: Armenians should stop complaining about other countries not helping out (militarily/through sanctions). Its such a soy take, why would foreign countries risk their troops lives with no tangible benefit for them."
12/17/2021,Skims outsources work to Turkey. Turkey is the country responsible for the Armenian genocide and refuses to acknowledge their actions,"Turkey has aggressively denied the Armenian genocide for centuries and their government still does so to this day.

Not only do they deny the genocide, they put out propaganda to cover their tracks. Kim K has actually addressed the Turkish government’s [attempts to cover up their actions](https://twitter.com/ANCA_DC/status/777194606660317184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E777194606660317184%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-22712373711498036121.ampproject.net%2F2112032204000%2Fframe.html).

Kim actually came under fire by leading Armenian organizations for producing Skims in Turkey and [responded on twitter that she was going to create business ties with Armenia… but never promised to drop Turkey.](https://amp.popbuzz.com/style/fashion/kim-kardashian-skims-solutionwear-turkey/). 

Now it’s hard to find info on whether Kim still uses Turkish sweatshops for her clothes, but I took a quick look at poshmark and did find some tags that still have “Made in Turkey”:

12/22/2022,Looking for recommendations to get involved remotely?,"Hi,

I've noticed that a lot of sources online do not cover Armenian issues or play both side-ism neutrality.

For instance,

1. [Native-Land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) shows indigenous land in several European-settler countries and Japan but fails to show the fact that a lot of indigenous people of Eurasia (Assyrians, Armenians, Kurds, Laz, etc) are barred from any meaningful control of their own land (in our case, anyone with an Armenian name is legally prohibited from Azerbaijan).
2. I've noticed that the Wikipedia for the 2021 invasion of Azerbaijan into the Republic of Armenia as a [""border crisis""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_Armenia%E2%80%93Azerbaijan_border_crisis) instead of invasion/occupation/incursion.  Literally the article is called the"" [2021–2022 Armenia–Azerbaijan **border crisis** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_Armenia%E2%80%93Azerbaijan_border_crisis)"" whereas Wikipedia accurately describes the incursion of Russia into Ukraine as an **invasion**. If you look at the talk, most of the resistance to calling it an ""invasion"" are due to a user named ""[Grandmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Grandmaster)"" who -- based on his/her edits -- I'm guessing is Azeri. This user repeats the false Azeri propaganda that ""the borders were never formally demarcated anyway so you cannot call it an invasion or occupation."" This argument is obviously false and is like saying because you cannot formally distinguish a grain of salt from a heap of sand, there is no difference whatsoever.

I would rather not have this discussion in the open here but there is obviously a lot of opportunity for us to more accurately represent and report on what is going on popular websites (example the two above).

Does anyone have any groups they'd recommend?"
10/29/2020,"Genuine question to the Armenians: what do you suggest to do with 700,000 IDPs?","I’ve been wanting to have a genuine conversation with an Armenian about this issue for a while. So no propaganda, no saying ‘there were only 40,000 Azeris in all of Karabakh’ and let’s have a civil discussion. You guys call for a ceasefire and I understand that. I’m emotionally exhausted by this war and by attack on Barda. Let’s say we stop today. What do we do about the 700,000 IDPs?
For context, I’ll point out some thing which are absolutely undisputed. Important factors that have led to the current conflict. Important factors which rightfully angered Azeris.

And here’s the crux of the argument:
The current Armenian government has shown its not willing to negotiate.
- Pashinyan rejected Basic/Madrid Principles
- Pashinyan wanted to change the format of negotiations saying that NK republic has to be a side in negotiations, however, no mention of Azeri IDPs having a say. For context, it was always outlined in the Basic/Madrid principles that both Azeris and Armenians of Karabkah should eventually participate
- Pashinyan said ‘Karabkah is Armenia, full stop’. He didn’t say Nagorno-Karabakh, but Karabkah which includes all of the 7 regions. That was not a mistake 
- Pashinyan planned to build a road to Jabrail
- Arutunyan wanted to move the capital to Shusha
- Arutunyan planned to settle Arab-Armenians in the 7 adjacent regions.
- Pashinyan’s excuse that Arutunyan is a PM of a sovereign state and he has no control over him is not true and was [proven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiragov_and_Others_v._Armenia) in European court for human rights.
So let’s say we achieve ceasefire now. What then? Should Azeris accept that the 700,000 are never to return home? Or do they return home without the right of self-determination and live in Armenia?"
7/1/2023,Looks like 10 million Armenians and 1.5 million Azerbaijanis. Armenian propaganda map.,
7/17/2020,Misinformation spread by Turkish sources,"Dear Armenians , as a Turkish citizen I feel so sad about latest conflicts occured due to Azerbaijani aggression. In Istanbul many people don't know that such a conflict is exist, also rest of people are misinformed by local new agencies. Such as;  [https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/border-clashes-between-azerbaijan-armenia-resume-after-short-pause](https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/border-clashes-between-azerbaijan-armenia-resume-after-short-pause) 

Please note that many Turkish intellectuals know that what kind of agony Armenians suffered and still they do. On the other hand we are few and unfortunately when the matter is about Armenians, there are many educated people still following a century old anti-Armenian propaganda.

We should inform people, by using international social media platforms such a ""reddit"" by hate speech and avoiding generalize people in our comments. And as I see this is going well. 

My deepest condolences for all who died for defending their homeland."
10/16/2020,We Cant Describe Our Rightous Case Well Enough!,"From looking at the international community in web all I see non Azerbaijani/Armenian people believe that Nagorno Karabakh was Armenian majority but Azerbaijan refused to give them at least an autonomous control despite they voted for it, Armenia had to invade so that they could save their kins, for this they had to occupy bunch of Azerbaijani majority districts too for strategical reasons. Azerbaijan is responsible for this and everything followed.

1. There already was a decades old autonomous oblast: Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast.
2. Armenians didnt petition for an autonomous oblast, like I said they already had it, they petitioned to BIND IT to ARMENIA! The Area between Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia was Azerbaijani majority!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/KarabakhConflict/comments/jc5eig/demographics\_of\_occupied\_districts\_of\_azerbaijan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarabakhConflict/comments/jc5eig/demographics_of_occupied_districts_of_azerbaijan/)

Look at Kelbajar and Lachin. The 5 Armenian majority districts they talk about has 137.000 Armenians.

3) They say Azerbaijan didnt want an autonomous rule in Nagorno Karabakh and tried to abolish it.

'' According to Armenia's former president, [Levon Ter-Petrossian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levon_Ter-Petrossian), the Karabakh leadership approach was maximalist and ""they thought they could get more.""[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#cite_note-72)[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#cite_note-73)[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#cite_note-74) ''

Azerbaijan only tried to abolish the autonomy when Nagorno Karabakh demanded to bind to Armenia with petition as a state reaction.

Wiki: ''On 13 February 1988, Karabakh Armenians began demonstrating in their capital, [Stepanakert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepanakert), in favour of unification with the Armenian republic. Six days later they were joined by mass marches in Yerevan. On 20 February, the Soviet of People's Deputies in Karabakh voted 110 to 17 to request the transfer of the region to Armenia. This unprecedented action by a regional soviet brought out tens of thousands of demonstrations both in Stepanakert and Yerevan, but Moscow rejected the Armenians' demands.''

They sell it as, they voted for an autonomous region not binding to Armenia. They already had it for decades under Soviets and continued to have it after dissolution of Soviets too.

&#x200B;

What I dont understand is this propaganda, ideas are so widespread on internet among third parties and everyone blames Azerbaijan and noone cares to correct them. How are Armenians so good at being ''rightful'' even in cases they are so wrong? Why dont we have a tongue to defend ourselves?"
11/5/2020,"In other news, Armenian Forces have destroyed 125% of all Azerbaijani Tanks",
10/4/2022,Eurovision being used again as an azerbaijani propaganda tool through the fake propaganda relationship of efendi (az 2021) and Tix (norway 2021)," I have already made a post about the double standards of the Eurovision Community Now it reached a New Level. Azerbaijan has been using Eurovision as a propaganda tool since the beginning. In 2021 the representatives of norway (tix) and azerbaijan (efendi) engaged in a fake pr relationship in order to get more points (this only worked in favour of norway funnily enough). NOW during these challending times for armenia Tix is now in azerbaijan promoting it as a tourist paradise while azeri soldiers are commiting war crimes every day against armenians. The biggest esc news website wiwibloggs that is very vocal about ukraine even covered this trip making it seem like a romantic love story in baku and not for what it really is a propaganda trip.   Why is this upsetting you ask despite the obvious? efendi has posed with aliyew onher insta during esc 2021 is a VOCAL ditator supporter, has called ALL Armenians terrorists especially the Kardashians who are many things but certainly not terrorists. Tix is being used as a propaganda tool to make Azerbaijan look good ( AND HE KNOWS IT he is not Oblivious to the whole situation ) he has A LOT OF YOUNG FANS that are very impressionable and a lot of people are invested in their fake love relationship. He is playing the BIGGEST victim card as he has tourretts but happily promotes and supports a person who is a VOCAL dictator aliyew supporter. This is upsetting on so many levels as russian artists and pro russia artists have been cancelled and scrutinized by the fandom but this somehow is ok according to their twisted standards.    

this is unbelievable and shows the real morals of Europe and the EU and Eurovision community"
9/21/2023,Currently the future of Armenians of Karabakh is being discussed on AzTV including how Azerbaijan should ensure they live a comfortable life and how they should be provided with proper jobs and infrastructure,
7/15/2021,To the People Freaking Out Here,"I know I'm not the only one to say this, but calm down people. This is partly in reference to Aliyev's outright demands upon Armenian territory, but also to the anti-Nikol crowds-- not saying I'm PRO-Nikol either, there's a lot wrong with him, but the extremist takes from these types who probably weren't even alive in 1999 to remember what was happening or how what people were saying at the time about Armenia's future, now looking back at the history of the republic through these ridiculous rose-colored glasses like everything post-LTP was near-perfect until Nikol came along and single-handedly doomed Armenia. I think it is time for the people who were around back then (it wasn't so long ago!) to step up and provide needed context and perspective on our current situation.

The people on here who keep saying things like ""there won't even be Armenia in ten years the rate we are going"", do they really think they are ""patriots"" or something? It's so annoying. While no one knows the future, I am almost certain doomsday predictions for Armenia are totally off-base, and what's more, just think about where we've been in the past. It's easy to forget there was a past before September 27, but what about in the period in 1992/3 almost half of Karabakh was conquered (briefly) and people in Yerevan were burning their floorboards for heat? The outlook after the parliament shooting or the 2008 violence which each left the nation in disarray? The outlook throughout the years that followed which, contrary to the propaganda you hear now about being a period of mind-boggling growth and financial well-being, at the time was actually a narrative of continuing brain-drain in a country which had no natural resources or seemingly anything going for it. Sure we had most of the territories of Artsakh at the time, but there never was a situation in which 5 out of the 7 (or likely 7 of the 7) territories were ever going to be kept, so the bemoaning of the ""loss of 75% of Artsakh"" is a complete fever-dream, as just because peace hadn't been made for the territory to be given back in the bargain doesn't mean we ""had"" those lands. They were at best on loan, and that's best represented by the state Kocharian kept them in throughout his presidency. Shushi at the time was still in ruins and nothing except Ghazanchetsots was restored. Even last year there was next to nothing in the territories around NKAO except for a little bit of development in Berdzor and Karchavar regions. It took two decades to have a second paved road connecting Armenia and NK, despite the fact it was one of the most important strategic things you could possibly do.

People seem to be living in their own reality (which is not uncommon after something bad) that everything prior was so great, and the fact many of them either never had a strong on-the-ground grasp of the situation in Armenia over these many decades or weren't even born in that period, it's easy to project one's perception of Armenia onto the period you don't know about which ultimately must be better than the ""hellhole"" we're living in now, right?

&#x200B;

tl;dr- Most people who now say Armenia is on the verge of destruction or won't exist soon are wearing rose-colored glasses on assessments of what the outlook for Armenia has been since independence. We need to spend more time looking at the past, learning from our mistakes, and gaining perspective by remembering what the general outlook was for Armenia back in what we now seen as the ""good old days"" of ""prosperity"". Armenia's continued existence is not to be taken for granted, but nor is the stream of pessimism based on a twisted view of the past and worst-case scenario dwelling helpful either. Unless you have a really good and fact-based reason laid out for this fatalistic extreme fatalism, please get a grip."

### Armenia’s ruling party accused of hiring young women for campaign marches in Yerevan

Armenia's ruling Civil Contract party has been accused of hiring young women to take part in campaign marches ahead of municipal elections in Yerevan. Local election monitoring group Akanates (eyewitness) has accused the ruling party and other parties of employing marketing agencies to hire people for marches and to distribute leaflets during the campaign period. The municipal elections on 17 September are expected to be highly competitive, and a litmus test of the public’s attitude towards the ruling government. The ruling party has denied the allegations, calling them 'absolute slander'

The share of Armenian-Turkish trade turnover in Armenia's foreign trade turnover is 1%. If direct trade is launched between Yerevan and Ankara, this figure may increase to 10% or more. According to the World Bank, the export potential from Armenia to Turkey ranges from 15 to 19% of our country’s GDP.

7/12/2023,Turkish identity and appropriation,"This post is basically how confusing it is for me to understand Turkish identity. this isn’t me saying anything negative just what is confusing to me. I don’t understand how most(from what I seen) Turks want to be seen as European. Turkey is around 97 percent in the Middle East, Turkic identity is from Central Asia, yet want to be seen as European. When they have no connection to Europe besides colonizing certain groups and three percent of the country is in Europe. 

Even culture wise, a lot of Turkish culture is basically middle eastern culture just slapped with Turkish on the name. Like Turkish kebab which is a normal kebab that the whole Middle East eats, Turkish humus, Turkish gyro, Turkish yogurt, and etc. its natural for your culture to be similar or take parts of those different cultures surrounding you, but for Turkey it’s seen as terrible to give credit or just leave it alone. 

Like Shammaran something that came from Kurds (I think also Persians) that recently had gotten more popularity in Turkey and now it’s a “Turkish myth”. Same thing with kawa legend or Newroz holiday. For some reason those are all slap with Turkish on it by many Turks. I even seen a few times that Kurdish clothes are “mountain Turk clothing” or “eastern Turk clothing” (sometimes). 

Turks have a beautiful culture I don’t get why it all has to be just Turkish when many of it may come from other cultures. I guess “Turkish washing” is the word for it. Kurds and Arabs from what I seen don’t do this. The most I seen Arabs claim from Kurdish culture is Saladin at the most. We have things that come from other cultures that we do and we never claim it at just “Kurdish”. it’s confusing to see a culture like Turkish do this when it’s very rich."
3/2/2022,Did you know that the South Caucasus don't exist (at least according to Fox News)?,
10/10/2020,A question on the makeup of the current Nagorno-Karabakh War.,"A lot of the posts and comments talk about the Azeri’s and Armenians fighting and about the destruction that Armenia is suffering from Azeri drones.

However, it was my understanding that the Republic of Artsakh (unrecognized) had its own defense force and while Armenia supplies and supports them, Armenian troops and equipment is not directly involved in the war.  Is this understanding correct? If so, shouldn’t we be distinguishing between Armenia and the ethnic Armenians in Artsakh?

Or are Armenian troops crossing the Azeri border and fighting with the Artsakh Defense Force? I feel like if it was Armenia vs Azerbaijan that the drones wouldn’t have as much free range as Armenia has a more integrated air defense system and similar air defense platforms as the Azeri’s. 

Thanks for the help and no propaganda or nationalist statements please."
10/9/2020,With love from Greece,"Dear r/armenia, greetings from Greece.
I am checking constantly the situation in NK. I, as other Greeks, have taken very close to heart this war. Us Greeks, as a people (and not the government) are very close to you, mainly due to the horrific past in the Turkish hands. We too have experienced massacres and a genocide. Close to 1 million Greeks were killed in the genocide of the pontic Greeks and the ethnic cleansing of Smyrna and other Asia Minor lands.
And now this. Turkey and Azerbaijan trying to put an end first to the Armenians of NK, then of the rest of Armenia.
I made a post on r/russia about the issue. It seems that the Russians believe that Putin will at least defend the Armenia proper, but not NK, and they justify it with the changes that happened 2 years ago. There is the false propaganda in media that Pashinian has moved away from Russia towards the EU, which, of course, is a lie.
I salute the changes you made 2 years ago. Finally there is a democracy in Caucasus. If we check the democracy index, Armenia has moved from 116 in 2015 to 86 in 2019. I believe soon Armenia will be even higher. Press freedom - Armenia is 5 points higher than Greece and only 15 behind the US. These are amazing achievements.
But it seems you guys are truly depending on a great power (Russia) just like us (USA), and in both cases... They do nothing. Turkey violates our aerial and maritime birders, the exclusive economic zone, etc, and nothing is done to protect us. Erdogan and Aliyev want to put an end to you, and nothing is done about it, even when it's proven that islamic extremists are fighting against you.
The hypocrisy of Russia and Turkey is astonishing.
When Russia needed Crimea and Donetsk Lugansk, they intervened with total neglect of ""international laws"", to protect their compatriots. But they say what Armenia does in NK is... occupation.
The Turks occupied Northern Cyprus (Cypriots are also Greek) and they say it's ""freedom and self determination"". A historic Greek land with majority Greek population was invaded and separated into 2, the ethnic cleansing commenced, and that's freedom. Historic Armenian lands are declared independent through a democratic referendum, and that's... occupation.
Sorry, I have rumbled on. I hope you guys will win. I hope the area you controlled will not be diminished. You guys cannot lose NK. The Turks won't stop at that. They will get hungrier. Look at our situation. We are ""allies"", yet they have territorial claims, they want to own Greek islands and Greek EEZ. Putin says he will protect Armenia proper. But then in 20 years? Will Russia have the same policy? The Turks must be stoped now."
9/21/2023,Nagorno-Karabakh lays down arms // Peacekeepers killed // Samvel Babayan's plan // Kremlin instructs media to blame Armenia and West: leak // Aliyev's message // Interviews // Kocharyan's audio message to Putin: AI or real?,"##day 2: Azerbaijan attacks Nagorno-Karabakh and civilians; tens of thousands [evacuated](https://youtu.be/NkGfqxI8AyI) so far

[Read the Tuesday coverage here](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16n5kwj/eu_warns_azerbaijan_not_to_cause_exodus_of_ethnic/).

On Wednesday the Azerbaijani army attacked an ambulance vehicle transporting several bodies to a morgue, injuring the driver. 

Casualties: 200 killed (5 children), 400 wounded (15 children). The fate of many civilians is still unknown. People don't have access to basic necessities. Families have been separated.

The battles continued in the frontline for positional control. Nagorno-Karabakh said Azerbaijan was able to capture new positions and roads while sustaining losses.

A 4th-century Armenian monastery Amaras went under Azerbaijani control. It's located in the southeast of the republic.

The city of Martakert (northeast) was evacuated after Azerbaijan targeted civilian infrastructure and captured positions in that direction. Mass evacuations from the Askeran region: [video](https://youtu.be/cwSls56yicU?t=20).

The mayor of Martakert Aznavor Saghyan was killed during an attack last night. Ter Hovhannes Hovhannisyan, an abbot from Dadivank monastery, was injured as a result of the aggression. He is in a hospital.

##... former adviser to the Nagorno-Karabakh government urges the President to make concessions

**BEGLARYAN ARTAK:** The authorities must make a bold and difficult decision very quickly while the public should accept it sensibly. This bloody genocide must be stopped as soon as possible. The losses are piling up while the enemy continues to encroach. 

It's obvious that Russia and the West do not want to stop this. Their criminal silence supports Azerbaijan. //

**Current and former Presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh held a meeting:** The reaction of international actors is inadequate. No practical steps are being taken by them. We will have to make difficult concessions. //

##... Kremlin justifies Azerbaijan's military aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh: ""It's their land"" 

**Putin's spokesman:** We are talking about military operations on the territory of Azerbaijan, recognized by Armenia. The criticism towards our peacekeepers is unjustified. //

Putin's office later joined Azerbaijan and announced that there was no ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh.

##... Russia presents Nagorno-Karabakh a [ceasefire](https://factor.am/690557.html) plan: ""lay down your arms""

Nagorno-Karabakh accepted the ceasefire offer. They will lay down their arms and agree to hold negotiations with Azerbaijan. It will take place on September 21st in the Azerbaijani town of Yevlakh. The topic will be ""Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians' reintegration, rights, and security.""

Under the ceasefire agreement, Russia will seize and remove all the heavy and lightweight military equipment owned by Nagorno-Karabakh's ""10,000-strong army."" Russia will supposedly send the equipment to Azerbaijan *[or Ukraine, who knows, it would be a shame if the defeat of Armenians ends up helping Russia against Ukraine right?]*.

##... Armenia's PM Pashinyan responds to NK-AZ ceasefire agreement 

**PASHINYAN:** An agreement was reached through Russia to establish a ceasefire. Armenia was not involved in preparing the text of this ceasefire agreement between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. 

The ceasefire text mentions armed forces of the ""Republic of Armenia"". We have said many times that the Republic of Armenia finished the withdrawal of its army from Nagorno-Karabakh in August 2021, so it's unclear why that language was used in the ceasefire agreement. 

The fact that this ceasefire agreement even mentions the ""Republic of Armenia"" reaffirms my suspicions raised yesterday, that one of the goals of this attack was to drag Armenia into a major war and deprive it of its independence and sovereignty.

If the Russian peacekeepers made this offer [to disarm the local defense forces], it's logical to assume that from now on, they will FULLY and without any reservations assume the full responsibility for Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians' safety. That means a full set of conditions must be created to ensure the rights of Armenians to safely live in their homes with dignity. Although I must say that we were expecting that to be the case starting in November 2020. //

##... why does the Russian ceasefire document mention the withdrawal of ""Republic of Armenia"" soldiers if they were withdrawn in 2021? || Interview with ex-MP Arman Babajanyan

**BABAJANYAN:** That was not by an error. It was done intentionally by Russia to clear Azerbaijan of wrongdoing for past/present/future aggression. It is a well-known fact that Armenia actually withdrew its conscripts and contractors from Nagorno-Karabakh in 2021. But Azerbaijan maintained the lie to use it against Armenia. Azerbaijan will use this to try to legitimize its aggression in the eyes of the international community, while Russia will try to cause problems in Armenia-West diplomatic cooperation. //

##... ranking member of Armenia's ruling party about pro-Russian political forces in Armenia:

**PAPOYAN GEVORG:** What you see in front of the government building *[hundreds of protesters attacked the building, injured police]* is nothing new. It's the same old tactic: foreign and internal forces jointly attacking Armenia's statehood. Do not fall for the manipulations of the foreign-controlled 5th column. 

##... the chronology of events, by Informed Citizens NGO Daniel Ioannesian 

**IOANNESIAN:** Let's recap the events that unfolded recently.

(1) Pro-Russian/Kocharyan forces come to power in Nagorno-Karabakh.

(2) Azerbaijan launches a large-scale assault, obviously with the permission of Russia judging from the Kremlin's response.

(3) Dmitri Medvedev hints that the Armenian government will be forcefully removed. 

(4) The Russian propaganda machine blames everything on the Armenian government. 

(5) Kocharyan's bolstered pro-Russian forces attack the Armenian government building.

(6) While possessing even more tanks and artillery than Armenia, the pro-Russian/Kocharyan government of Nagorno-Karabakh capitulates within a day.

It's understandable that Russia wants to turn Armenia into Belarus 2.0, but it is sad that some residents of Armenia are willing to join and act against national interests. //

##... Operation Ring 2.0

**ARA HAKOBYAN, politician:** Right now we are losing territories of Nagorno-Karabakh in a similar way that we lost Shahumyan during Operation Ring. Under the watch of Russian soldiers, Azerbaijan is currently removing ethnic Armenians from their lands. 

We had a similar situation during the Sumgayit massacres when Russian soldiers stood by, and once the job was done, they would escort residents out so they could earn the title of savior. The exact same scenario is unfolding today. 

Putin and Erdogan met not long ago in Sochi. They must have reached an agreement to allow this attack. Russia must have secured something in return. Time will tell what Russia's prize is. //

##... ""there was an agreement between Erdogan and Putin"": Valeri Solovei, Russian opposition figure 

**REPORTER:** Why did Azerbaijan conduct its Russian-style ""special military operation"" now? How do you explain the timing?

**SOLOVEI:** The agreement was reached between Erdogan and Putin on September 4th. By the way, that was the only topic they agreed around. Erdogan asked Putin if he would mind an operation against Nagorno-Karabakh and *maybe* Armenia too. Putin gave the green light. This information was leaked immediately. I can verify its authenticity. 

**REPORTER:** Why did Putin take a 180 turn compared to 2020 when he was against Turkish activities in the region?

**SOLOVEI:** First. Just as in 2020, Putin wants Pashinyan gone because he hates anything that resembles a color revolution and democracy.

Second. Russia couldn't resist Turkey today even if it wanted to. Russia depends on Turkey's transit hubs and other partnerships.

Third. Putin no longer gives a crap about anything. He wants to leave chaos behind him. He is proud of the chaos he creates around the world.

**REPORTER:** Armenia's First Lady went to Ukraine with aid, Armenia is ratifying the Rome Statute, and Armenia is hosting U.S. soldiers. The following might be the Kremlin's response: Russian regulator has declared Armenian cognac as an unwanted product on the territory of Russia. The same had happened to Georgian wine. How did this AM-RU conflict start?

**SOLOVEI:** Armenians finally understood that Russia doesn't plan to help them so they began to search for other defense partners. Russia is using that in an attempt to pin the blame on Armenia: *""You abandoned us for the West.""* 

**REPORTER:** How will this end for Nagorno-Karabakh?

**SOLOVEI:** Azerbaijan will assume physical control of Nagorno-Karabakh. A significant portion of ethnic Armenians will leave. Some elements of self-governance will be granted. 

**REPORTER:** How will this end for Pashinyan?

**SOLOVEI:** Unfortunately for the Kremlin, there is still no strong reaction against Pashinyan. The Kremlin was expecting a much stronger wave of anger and a pro-Russian revolution.

Russia should expect the collapse of CSTO. Armenia will certainly exit it soon, followed by Kazakhstan in early 2024. The Kazakh president Tokayev has already informed Putin about their plans to leave CSTO. //

##... leak reveals Putin's plan to instruct its media outlets to blame everything on Pashinyan and the West 

[The leak](https://factor.am/690694.html) was published by the Russian media outlet Meдuza. According to the report, Putin's office sent instructions to its media outlets on September 19. 

They advise them to blame the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh on Armenia and the West. 

The Kremlin also wants the Russian peacekeepers to be portrayed as merely ""observers"" who are assisting in the evacuation of the population.

The Kremlin also wants the Russian Orthodox Church in Nagorno-Karabakh to get credit for housing IDPs. 


##... ex-PM Armen Babajanyan about NK-AZ negotiations || Samvel Babayan's ignored plan 

**BABAJANYAN:** The November 9, 2020, agreement is in the deathbed. Enter Lavrov Plan and the full ""integration"" of Armenians into Azerbaijan. Of course you should not expect Russian peacekeepers to ensure the safety of Armenian civilians. Only residents who are incapable of leaving will stay in Nagorno-Karabakh, giving Russia just enough Armenian presence to maintain its troops in the region.

As Lavrov has stated [in March 2023, months *before* Pashinyan's ""clarification"" of Azerbaijan's 86,600 km² territorial integrity], Russia wants Armenians in Azerbaijan to have the same rights as the Serbs in Kosovo, meaning no rights, no local governing bodies.

That is what Samvel Babayan's critics wanted. They ignored his repeated warnings to hold a meeting with Azerbaijan as soon as possible to negotiate from more dignified positions. I can reveal its content now:

Those documents contained very dignified terms for Nagorno-Karabakh. *At the time*, Azerbaijan agreed to negotiate the formation of essentially an autonomous republic within Azerbaijan with its own small number of guards.

But the [Nagorno-Karabakh authorities] rejected it and Russia eventually dragged them to a full capitulation. Now this will help Russia destabilize Armenia and hijack power in Yerevan. We must be prepared to fight for our statehood. //

##... Gen. Samvel Babayan offered his support to establish a ceasefire and negotiate with Azerbaijan, got rejected again

**HAYK KHANUMYAN, politician:** Yesterday I spoke with President Shahramanyan and conveyed that at this difficult moment, Samvel Babayan is ready to take full responsibility and negotiate with Azerbaijan.

The President agreed to host Babayan. However, presumably under the pressure of Bako Sahakyan and Arkadi Ghukasyan [ex-regime that returned to power] he later changed his mind and rescinded Babayan's invitation. The President said they were in touch with Azerbaijan through Russian mediation to reach a ceasefire agreement. //


##... interview with journalist Tatul Hakobyan 

**REPORTER:** What happened? Why was the government changed in Nagorno-Karabakh? Why did they miss the opportunity to reach a more favorable outcome a month ago?

**TATUL:** Azerbaijan was demanding the removal of heavy equipment from Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia had already withdrawn its army from Nagorno-Karabakh in 2021. Azerbaijan's new demand was the removal of heavy equipment owned by the Nagorno-Karabakh army. There weren't that many to begin with due to the blockade. 

Russia made an offer to Nagorno-Karabakh: Give your equipment to us and you'll maintain something like a national guard consisting of internal forces. That offer was being discussed. *[and the now-former president of Nagorno-Karabakh Arayik Harutyunyan had already agreed to remove the equipment and they even managed to remove dozens of tanks and vehicles before the war, but the process was stopped for reasons unclear]*

**TATUL continues:** Nagorno-Karabakh's new president Shahramanyan discussed Russia's offer to remove the equipment during various internal meetings. There were likely very sharp objections, prompting him to ""go until the end"". They miscalculated. 

**REPORTER:** You and Samvel Babayan had been urging them to go for a compromise.

**TATUL:** Vitali Balasanyan *[NK official who negotiated with Azerbaijan under Arayik administration]* and I had a complicated past but as soon as I learned he was negotiating with Azerbaijan, I was one of the few public figures at the time who praised that decision. We cannot trust Russia, the U.S., or anyone else. The best guarantee for security is holding negotiations with Turks. If you don't, you end up capitulating like this. This is a capitulation.

**REPORTER:** Who is at fault?

**TATUL:** From 1994-1998, the ""traitor"" president LTP was ready to resolve the conflict but the 1998 coup stopped it. The 2020 loss is of course the fault of the current government in Armenia. That's just how it works. But the September 20 capitulation is the fault of the current Nagorno-Karabakh government that came to power a few weeks ago.

The priority right now should be to save the people of Nagorno-Karabakh:

(1) We must discuss the possibility of evacuating NK residents. Anyone who dared to speak about this a month ago was deemed a traitor. Now it's necessary.

(2) Will Russian peacekeepers stay? We only have 2 years left. Ignore Maria Zakharova and Margarita Simonyan and establish good relations with Russia.

(3) If peacekeepers will stay, find out if it'll be possible for ethnic Armenians of NK to continue to live in their homes. No one should be ""forced"" to live there. 

(4) Former leaders of Armenia must speak up and comfort the public. I think LTP predicted this day with 100% accuracy. In 1998 he said, ""We will all answer for leading our people to another catastrophe."" Kocharyan and Serj should speak, too.

(5) When this is all over, it will be time for new elections again. It's necessary after each major event.

**REPORTER:** Why does the ceasefire agreement accuse the Republic of Armenia of having an army in Nagorno-Karabakh when in reality it doesn't?

**TATUL:** That language was added by Russia and Azerbaijan. The latter will undoubtedly try to use it against Armenia during the UNSC session. But I wouldn't hyperfocus on it.

##... interview with Armenian defense official Andranik Kocharyan 

**REPORTER:** Explain the latest events.

**ANDRANIK:** The new government of Nagorno-Karabakh, joined by all previous leaders and other figures, discussed and approved Azerbaijan's ceasefire terms during a meeting with Russian peacekeepers. 

Notably missing from the meeting was Samvel Babayan, who had been urging for months to hold dialogue with Azerbaijan to buy more time for Nagorno-Karabakh *and* Armenia.

**REPORTER:** It wasn't just the Nagorno-Karabakh government. The opposition parties in Armenia were also against meeting Azerbaijan. They considered any dialogue with Azerbaijan as capitulation.

**ANDRANIK:** And that's when Ruben Vardanyan appears in Nagorno-Karabakh and receives a ranking position from President Arayik. His mission was murky. He began advocating for Nagorno-Karabakh to reject anything and everything that connects them to Azerbaijan, any dialogue. Where was Ruben Vardanyan during the ceasefire signing?

**REPORTER:** If we could launch the negotiations a month ago from better positions, why didn't we go for it? Today we have chaos, deaths, and ultimatums.

**ANDRANIK:** Today a thought crossed my mind: the 2020 war ended today during that meeting between Nagorno-Karabakh leaders and Russian peacekeepers. So the question is, why did Arayik resign and sit on that advisory board right next to the new president? Will Arayik testify to the War Commission? 

Because by judging from the events surrounding the 2016, 2020, and 2023 wars, it seems that the strings are being pulled from outside Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The producer of this show has his own interests and plans. If they were going to sign this ceasefire agreement, why didn't they do so months ago that would have granted the Armenian side a stronger role in the process?

**REPORTER:** Where are the puppet masters?

**ANDRANIK:** [Russia]. Their puppets have just been activated in Armenia.

**REPORTER:** [asks about the efforts to strengthen Armenia's army]

**ANDRANIK:** We are building fortifications that should have been built 20 years ago. Within 5 months we created reinforced regions without publicly advertising it. 

**REPORTER:** What are those?

**ANDRANIK:** Engineering structures that will allow us to defend our borders with minimal human losses. 

**REPORTER:** We have been building new fortifications?

**ANDRANIK:** Yes.

**REPORTER:** What are they?

**ANDRANIK:** Structures that strong and developed countries like France and Germany build.

**REPORTER:** Where are they?

**ANDRANIK:** On borders. Especially on the second line of defense. These second lines didn't even *exist* until now. In Nagorno-Karabakh, I think they managed to build just a single similar structure right before the 2020 war. We sustained 0 deaths and 0 wounded in that location. It was done by Gen. Grigoryan, the same guy in charge of our engineering forces today. 

##... EU and France call on Azerbaijan to ensure dignified treatment for Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh 

**CHARLES MICHEL:** This morning, I called on President Aliyev to ensure a complete cease-fire and a safe, dignified treatment of Karabakh Armenians by Azerbaijan. Human rights and security must be ensured. //



##... Azerbaijani president ""recognizes Armenia's territorial integrity"", cites Azeri army losses and ""mission already accomplished"" for agreeing to the ceasefire with Nagorno-Karabakh

**ALIYEV:** They unexpectedly demonstrated political competence. We appreciate it and consider it an important step. These events will have a positive impact on the peace process. This will create long-term peace in the South Caucasus. Armenia should feel confident that we do not have eyes on Armenian lands. Azerbaijan recognizes the territorial integrity of Armenia. We would have gone until the end had they not lay down their arms in Karabakh. However, our military also has losses. The Armenian population of Karabakh are citizens of Azerbaijan. We want to coexist with peace based on mutual respect and mutual understanding. //

##... peacekeepers were ambushed and killed in Nagorno-Karabakh in a territory controlled by Russians and Azeris 

Russia's MOD revealed that one of the peacekeeping vehicles was returning from its observation point when it was ambushed by rifle fire. Everyone in the vehicle was killed. Russian and Azerbaijani authorities are conducting a joint investigation.

While making no mention of the attackers' identity, Russia's foreign ministry chose to trashtalk ""ungrateful"" critics instead:

MARIA ZAKHAROVA: ""Նրանք [peacekeepers] զոհվել են հանուն տարածաշրջանում խաղաղության։ Ապերախտությունը, որով ոչ մաքրասեր մարդիկ փորձեցին կասկածի տակ դնել նրանց գործունեությունը, չի ստվերի ընկածների սխրանքը, այլ կդառնա զրպարտիչների հավերժ խարանը"" //

##... Kocharyan allegedly sent an audio message to Putin revealing their post-2018 plan || Kocharyan says the audio is an AI fake 

[Here is the audio](https://youtu.be/C26UzTNgAxE?t=276). The breathing and pauses make it sound authentic although I'm not an AI expert. Can the AI replicate a high-quality speech in the *Armenian* language? This is what the voice says:

**VOICE:** Since my [re]entry into politics in 2018 and the active resistance to the current government took place under our mutual agreement [with Putin], I'd like to ask you to ensure my planned exit from this situation. Living and working here in Armenia like a hostage while having a constant target on my back is unacceptable. Your opinion has a decisive power here. I'm not in the position to go against your will so I'd like to ask you to secure my planned exist from this situation. //

Kochayan believes the ""AI fake"" audio is a preemptive political strike meant to harm his future activities. He said his last phone call with Putin was in 2021 but did not deny sending this as a pre-recorded message afterward. 
If the audio is real, it is still unclear whether it's new or it was recorded in 2019-2020 while he was in/facing jail.

7/17/2020,Countermeasures against Bayraktar TB2,"Turkish Defence Ministry made a new announcement that they are willing to help Azerbaijan with everything they have including armed drones. I would probably feel ashamed if I were someone from Azerbaijan. Being 3 times larger than Armenia, having 4, times more population, oil money, all the propaganda that they will take Armenia in 24 hours and yet begging help from Turkey as they are not able to handle Armenian Army in one single army post. 

But that's not the subject. Let's talk the possibility of Turkey delivering Bayraktar TB2 drones to Azerbaijan. Those drones proved themselves in Syria and Libya. They can strike us by not even entering our territory.

My question is, what kind of countermeasures we have against it? What should be our strategy?"
7/17/2023,My Armenia and Armenia-adjacent news media diet. What's yours?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open a conversation about where we get our media and share what my usual sources are. I find a lot of Armenian media to be crap, so it's important to me to separate the wheat from the chaff. You share too, with all honesty! Diaspora outlets and regional/neighboring country outlets are encouraged.  I find it important to develop a broad perspective.

This is an old [thread](https://armeniapedia.org/wiki/Media) about Armenia's media landscape by a deleted user.

My list is not comprehensive, it's just what I've been exposed to.

**Armenian Outlets**

[Hetq](https://hetq.am/) [EN/ARM/RU] 

I am a big fan of Hetq. Their investigative journalism is arguably the best in Armenia: they reveal corruption, human rights violations, and they were the ones that broke the story that President Armen Sarkissian was a dual citizen. Ever since the 2020 Artsakh war, they have had an excellent series of articles and videos investigating what happened as well. They cover not just political news, but sociocultural phenomena.  Good diaspora coverage as well.

I also recommend the Hetq podcast for great analytical content, as well their Youtube channel.

They translate a significant amount of their articles into English. However, the full slate is in Armenian, including some of their best work.

Funded by grants from Open Society Foundation and probably other Western sources I am not aware of. However, I find them quite impartial.

[Civilnet](https://www.civilnet.am/) [EN, ARM, RU]

Good one stop shop for both Armenian and Armenian diaspora news, analysis, and multimedia. Lots of excellent content in text, audio, and video form. They have more diaspora coverage in English than in Armenian. Founded by Vartan Oskanian, former Armenian MFA from 2000-2008. Pro-government in the early Velvet Revolution, these days it is often anti-government (as its editor is). I would describe it as independent and not very slanted. However, it has a ""Western"" origin, funding, and perspective.

[Aliq Media](aliqmedia.am/)  [AR]

Lots of analytical pieces along with news. New alternative media outlet, and it has a nice Youtube channel as well.

Founded by former advisor to Nikol Pashinyan, Arsen Kharatyan, but it is quite critical of the government. Levonakan slant. 

[Factor.am](https://factor.am/) [EN, ARM, RU]

Pretty big outlet with some pro-govt or Western slant. I don't read it as much but it's on the reliable side and interviews quality guests sometimes.

[Mediamax](https://mediamax.am/am/) [EN, ARM, RU]

Overall quality outlet. High amount of exclusive academic, analytical, and cultural pieces. However, not as ""productive."" Also excellent multimedia: they have special projects, like one that retells the [First Republic of Armenia's](https://republic.mediamax.am/) story.

[Armenpress](https://armenpress.am/eng/) [EN, AM, RU, FR, etc.]

The first stop for daily news of all kinds. National news company of Armenia, owned by the Government of Armenia, but relatively impartial. Not always the most detailed or accurate (crappy titles are common).

[Azatutyun](https://www.azatutyun.am/) [ARM/EN/RU]

US-government funded outlet. Great daily with unique content, but must keep in mind its slant.

[ArtsakhPress](https://artsakhpress.am/arm/) [ARM/EN/RU]

Independent news agency in Artsakh with solid daily news content. Similar to Armenpress.

[Aravot](https://www.aravot.am/) [ARM/EN/RU]

I don't often use it, but it is one of the classic newspapers of Armenia. Strongy anti-government, has also always been a critic of the ""nakhkinner"" (Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan). Historically has had a Levonakan slant. Has had landmark pieces and famous editorials. Professional and accurate. Lots of Artsakh coverage.

English language stuff is generally low quality.

**Regional outlets**

[OC-Media](https://oc-media.org/)  [mainly EN, sometimes regional languages]

Covers the Caucasus as a whole. Runs off of EU and Open Society Foundations funding. I would say they are rather impartial and give a good picture of what's going on in the Caucasus region. They have quality journalists from all the countries. High quality op-eds and podcast as well.

[Eurasianet](eurasianet.org/) [EN, RU]

Runs off EU/UK/US and Open Society foundations funding. Quality picture of the Caucasus and Central Asia. Editor Joshua Kucera has shown an Azerbaijani bias.

[Caucasus Edition](https://caucasusedition.net/) [EN/RU]

Billed as a ""journal of conflict transformation,"" Caucasus Edition hosts authors from across the Caucasus. Pretty interesting interviews, analytical pieces, and research. Funded by grants from various Western governments and peace-initiatives, their slant is bringing peace among the peoples of the Caucasus. Unique stuff here you won't find in other places.

[RFERL](https://www.rferl.org/) [EN/RU]

Azatutyun is a branch of this US-government outlet. This has feature articles on Armenia, the Caucasus region, and really many parts of Eurasia.


**Armenian diaspora outlets**

[Agos](https://www.agos.com.tr/) [TR, Western Armenian, EN]

Historic Turkish-Armenian newspaper founded by Hrant Dink. Unique perspectives on Armenian diaspora, Turkish, and Armenian issues. Nice sociocultural material as well.

[Armenian Weekly](https://armenianweekly.com/) [EN]

American newspaper owned by the ARF (Armenian Revolutionary Federation) party. Publishes many perspectives. Great as a diaspora outlet, lots of cultural and social content.

**Azerbaijani outlets**

Independent media in Azerbaijan is nearly nonexistent due to govenrment censorship. If you feel like reading what their government outlets are saying, it's not useless, but it is propaganda. Based outside of Azerbaijan are dissident outlets.

The Berlin-based dissident outlet [Meydan TV](https://www.meydan.tv/en/) (AZ/EN/RU) is worth a read for understanding the domestic politics of AZ. The editor is Emin Milli, former political prisoner in Azerbaijan. 

[Baku Research Institute](https://bakuresearchinstitute.org/en/home-page/) [AZ/EN] is a think-tank that has some pretty good analytical articles about Azerbaijan. It is independent, and they even publish Armenians occasionally.

Mikroskop Media is another new mysterious dissident outlet in Azerbaijan. Mostly publishes in AZ with occasional English content. One of the only AZ outlets where you'll find material acknowledging the current Armenian plight.

**Other useful sources**

10/14/2023,The current situation in the middle east is good news for Russia,"It's an absolute shit-show in the middle east, generally always is, but right now it's especially so. 

Meanwhile, in the USA there is a deepening divide which has already begun turning into outright violence. This divide is entirely political and support for Israel has been a political matter for some time. 

Russia would be absolutely moronic for not taking advantage of these factors. Literally all they have to do is post inflammatory content supporting one side or another. Like a post likening LGTBQ+ support for Palestine to chickens supporting KFC or posts about Israel's treatment of Palestinian farmers.  True, false. This side, that side. It doesn't matter. All that matters is we get MAD. Mad enough to start fighting between ourselves over something that's occurring on the opposite side of the globe and will likely never be Resolved.

11/2/2022,"American, Hispanic. I’ve loved Armenia since I was a child. I can’t really explain why.","When I was a little boy, I discovered baklava came from Armenia. Everytime my family bought it at the supermarket or got it from someone at a bakery we all took our respective pieces and were very happy, commenting on how good it tasted and yummy it felt from the flakes to the honey to the filling just everything is wonderful about it. A bit older, as a teenager I remember my parents started constantly staying stocked up on Lavash bread at all times and using it for a wide variety of things. This summer while they were in season I bought multiple packages of dried apricots to dice and eat in my oatmeal or yogurt or with breakfast cereal. I’m now 23 and I can’t think back to a time I wasn’t impacted by this nation. 

In New England they taught us that in WWII the Holodomer happened to the Ukrainians and that the entirety of Poland was carried out from both sides, east and west and many millions of Pole citizens perished. They taught us how in WWI the Greek, Pontic genocide + population exchange and the Hamidian massacres/Armenian genocide + deportation, death marches into Syria and Mesopotamia shaped their modern diaspora as they attempted to flee to safety away from their oppressive and terroristic criminal overlords. I SO wish I could go back to the 3rd or 4th grade from the era of the 2nd Bush administration and bring back one of these textbooks into these modern times so we may NEVER forget what your ancestors went through. I am descended from the far western, totally opposite side of Southern Europe but I want you folks to know that for me, to know of Armenia is to know love. 

It is my understanding that your institutions were strong and so you never lost education and the teachings of craftsman work. You were sought after by empires the world over for your master expertise. 

In medieval times, France had a special relationship with Armenian Cilicia and Cyprus. I wish the relationship between Spain and Armenia was stronger. In central and South America most people don’t understand what the late Ottomans did and what modern Turkey has been allowed to get away with. 

If only the Armenian state would fund a project to spread the truth and awareness in Spanish and Portuguese language media to counter antiArmenian lobbyist propaganda. I’d be first in line to sign up for a job. Which brings me to tamale this point; what interest is there in carrying this message to the West and Latin speakers in the global south?

Much love to Hayk from a Catholic person. You are not any different from us. I see you as my family. Hugs and kisses. May Van cats soon return to the side of their rightful masters! 🐱🐈‍⬛"

The law of Coat of Arms of the Republic of Armenia which ironically has been passed by Kocharyan himself states that only official entities can use the coat of arms and through approval via legislation, e.g.:

11/10/2020,Armenian- American perspective on peace deal and riots in Armenia.,"  To preface, I’ve tried to be unbiased and objective when it came to this war, but obviously being Armenian I have some innate bias. I have been following both subs and combat subs to get a full picture of the situation and honestly I can’t believe Armenia pushed this BS agenda for so long. Even at the start of the conflict I was telling people Armenia should take their troops out. It was clear that Azerbaijan was going to win from the get go but due to lies spewed by the Armenian government to the people, they had false hopes of winning which cost the lives of men, women and children 
, on both sides. 

  Now, the Armenian population is rioting due to these lies. They actually believed the propaganda maps and fake info about how the military is destroying a billion drones a day and how they are winning. Frankly, I’m ashamed that they still want to push for more fighting leading to more death. I’m hoping they can swallow their pride and sit the fuck down to start working on better relations with Azerbaijan and Turkey or that part of the world is always going to hate each other.

Since Azeris are more level headed right now, I’m hoping some of you feel the same way as me when it comes to repairing relations."
3/8/2021,Do we believe our non-violent history?,"This goes for both Azeris and Armenians.

I'm always surprised when the answer to Sumgait or Khojali, to name a pair, is ""That was faked"" or ""It was just a few bad apples.""

I was reading through virtualkarabakh.az today, and a lot of the facts (eg. Majority Armenian population according to every Soviet census), are sent through a heavily biased opinion mill (eg. Expelling Azerbaijanis from their historic lands). 

And then when you get to the 90s war itself, it's like it came out of thin air because Armenians are the most aggressive state ever. Rather than considering that these are the 500,000 people who fled their homes in Baku and Sumgait, Ganja, Nakhichevan and others, and honestly feared for their lives after being bombarded from Shusha and Kalbajar for months. So they got their hands dirty. And they did some horrible stuff.

It's like both sides look at every event in a vacuum. Some people were relocated during Soviet times? Oh, so no Armenians ever lived in this region. There's Caucasian Albanian history? Oh, so all these churches are Caucasian Albanian. 

20% of Baku's population was Armenian, pre-Soviet... Baku. Not Karabakh, or Azerbaijan. Baku. That doesn't seem like a Armo-Soviet plot to repopulate Karabakh. (PS. The censuses are really interesting to study the movement of people on both sides, birth rates, etc. Worth a close look by everyone).

And so my question. When reading propaganda like the virtualkarabakh.az site, do you believe it? Does the author believe it? Or do you all realize it's international PR and national propaganda?

I know the Armenian side does it too. That's not my point, or the answer to this question to you. The longer we let this slide, the longer we'll forget it's all a lie."

11/15/2020,A list of Russian Armenians who are working against Pashinyan,"Hi guys. I have been following Russian news recently and there are Russian Armenians, who are in holding the influential positions in media, working against Nikol Pashinyan and spreading fake news about his government. They might be sponsored by Robko and his fellas. The anti-Pashinyan team:

1) Margarita Simonyan, chief-editor of Russian propaganda TV channel “Russia today”
2) Aram Gabrelyanov, owner of several newspapers and websites.
3) Roman Babayan, TV-host of the political show on NTV channel
4) Semen Bagdasarov, a political expert who shows up on the political shows on a regular basis 

Those people have never lived in Armenia and probably they never will, but they are trying so hard to make Pashinyan guilty for Arsakth. Looks like they are getting paid very well."

11/10/2020,Victims of a disinformation campaign,"Canadian here with an interest in global politics. I mean this in the kindest manner but are you now aware you were the victims of a massive disinformation campaign? How will you view news from Armenian sources going forwards? What changes will you make to avoid being mislead again? 


Social media disinformation is a very dangerous trend. We're seeing it increasingly all over the world from Facebook, reddit, and fake news (not how Trump means it). I found it especially problematic that people were accusing the real updates of being fake here.

4/2/2017,Something you should be aware of: Turks love the fighting between Kurds and Assyrians,"[This was shared here a day ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assyria/comments/62fby3/what_is_this_subs_thoughts_on_this_map_of_greater/)

My point is Turks have been doing this for years and making sure Kurds hate Assyrians and Assyrians hate us back.. Do you really think this helps our causes? Who does it benefit for us to be fighting, us or them?

You need to be aware that they [Turkey (and Iraqi's)] actively, via propaganda make sure we are at each others throats.

I believe Kurds, Armenians and Assyrians should be united against Turkey to be stronger as a larger force.

They want us hating and distrusting each other. Fighting amongst ourselves.. They will achieve this and make another enemy for Armenia to deal with if you don't make an active effort prevent this. For your sake and ours.

So I call for some allegiance. Make an effort to change each others views, on all sides to let go of hatred and unite."

>70 citizens of Armenia addressed an open letter to Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan with a request not to deviate a single step from the peace agenda with Azerbaijan and forget about territorial issues. The essence of the appeal boils down to one thing: we fought and want peace.

(3) New ""AzovStal"" plant in Armenia.","##interview with ex-prime minister Aram Sargsyan / Meghri for Karabakh and Lachin / Russia's role / Meetings with Minsk Group co-chairs

**REPORTER:** In his [opening statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/14eypwv/tldr_pashinyan_reveals_details_from_the_2020/), Pashinyan cited parts of the plan to exchange Meghri with Artsakh [Nagorno Karabakh]. He said the document was from August-November 1999, and that the discussions around the exchange ended in 2001. What do you know about this?

**SARGSYAN:** There was, in fact, a plan to exchange Meghri for Artsakh. Kocharyan's denial now is shameful. He was actively trying to convince me and 5 other members of the Security Council that an exchange would be a great idea because it would grant independence to Artsakh.

**REPORTER:** Was Armenia supposed to surrender towns and roads in southern Syunik, near Meghri?

**SARGSYAN:** There were 3 possible scenarios:

1) The main option. Exchange the Meghri region with the Lachin region. Artsakh gains independence.

2) MFA Vardan Oskanyan presented the second option to the 4-5 members of the Security Council. I've testified about this to the October 27 investigation committee. I even disclosed the classified schemes presented by Vardan Oskanyan. 

So what was in this second option? There would be a ""point zero"" in Meghri that wouldn't belong to any country. Like an international area. It wasn't very clearly defined.  

3) point zero would be not in Meghri [southern Armenia], but in the narrowest link separating Azerbaijan from Nakhijevan. This is the region near Tegh village. They would choose an uninhabited area for the exchange.

There was another option to build a highway estacade proposed later during negotiations. Constitutional Court president Gagik Harutyunyan had his input on these options.

The plan proposed by Robert Kocharyan, the one he believed would be the best, was the exchange of the Meghri region with the Lachin region and Artsakh's independence [option 1].

Kocharyan and the witnesses from the Security Council must come forward and admit this if they love their country. End the lies now.

I believe it is a sin to disclose details from a private conversation, but I'll make an exception now because this is important for our Republic. I will declassify our conversation.

I [prime minister] met Kocharyan [president] in his cabinet. He began to convince me that the exchange plan was excellent. He said our border with Iran is going to shut down either way, so while we still have a chance we should accept the funds that we were being offered. At the time, the UN was offering $6bn to Armenia and $8bn to Azerbaijan to relocate refugees. While we still have a chance, let's accept the deal and make Artsakh independent, he said.

At first, I thought he was just displaying braggadocio, to make an impression. I thought he took me for someone who wasn't aware of Goble's plan [double corridor concept]. Only later did I realize that what he was referring to was unrelated to Goble's plan.

Kocharyan told me that he drew that plan himself. He said he spent lots of time and resources on it. He paid a Czech journalist to bring that plan to Heydar Aliyev's attention. During one of the OSCE Minsk Group meetings, Kocharyan [pretending to be clueless] informed Heydar that a certain document had reached his table suggesting a swap between the Meghri region and Lachin/Artsakh, and Kocharyan asked Heydar if he knew anything about it. Heydar told him that he received the same document. 

I have just committed a sin by disclosing this. If Kocharyan tries to deny this, he will sin, too. Kocharyan fully supported the exchange.

Moreover, the Meghri exchange document cited by Pashinyan was part of this discussion. Kocharyan negotiated only around that document. He wasn't interested in the other options [other options = point zero international hub, or corridor via Tegh instead of Meghri]. 

**REPORTER:** Kocharyan was the author of the Meghti exchange plan?

**SARGSYAN:** Yes.

**REPORTER:** Kocharyan claims the Meghri for Lachin/Artsakh exchange plan was offered by Heydar Aliyev, and that it was never discussed under the OSCE Minsk Group because he rejected it.

**SARGSYAN:** Hah, what a shame. A former president of Armenia should not lie like that. Like a coward, he is claiming it wasn't him who told me all of that, that it wasn't him who called the exchange a ""great idea"". 

Do you know how the Meghri plan became a topic of discussion within Armenia? I was the one to disclose it after October 27. At the time, I was one of the main figures in that process. As a newly appointed prime minister, after two months, I traveled to Meghri and disclosed the existence of that plan while promising to stop it by doing everything in my power.

Kocharyan fired me for that. They said, ""We'll give you anything you want if you voluntarily resign"". I said no. I was a prime minister for only 6 months by then. He could not have fired me for my inability to raise the birth rate within just 6 months. A baby needs 9 months to be born; they can't even do that math. They fired me for publicizing the Meghri plan.

The OSCE Minsk Group's co-chairs paid a visit to the government, along with their state ambassadors and 15 staff members. During the meeting, US co-chair Carey Cavanaugh asked me about the general public opinion in Armenia regarding the Meghri exchange plan.  

**REPORTER:** But Kocharyan claims the Meghri plan wasn't a topic of OSCE Minsk discussion, so why was the co-chair asking?

**SARGSYAN:** Kocharyan is lying. After hearing that question, I told the US co-chair that the Meghri plan is being kept secret from the public because I've been told that the negotiations are still in an advisory phase and that until there is a common agreement, we cannot disclose it, so the public is still unaware. The co-chair then asks me how we plan to resolve the issue of exchange without even knowing the public opinion.

I took that as a hint that it was time for the public to know. 

When [the government] first presented me with the exchange plan, I was informed that it was a secret of the highest level. I signed the ""non-disclosure"" document. It was difficult for me to keep it inside because my brother had just lost his life. So I gave a full confession to the church leader under the condition it would remain secret. I told him about the exchange plan. His response was: ""Չըլլալիք բան է։"" [""ain't gonna happen""]

**REPORTER:** So His Holyness Garegin B. can corroborate your statement if necessary?

**SARGSYAN:** Yes. The exchange was no longer a secret within the HHK party. They knew that Kocharyan was firing me for publicizing the plan. After all this, they dare to utter the name of my brother today. No honor. They knew at that point. I summoned the leaders of every parliamentary party to inform them about the plan.

When I shared the info with ARF's Hrant Margaryan, he fell into hysteria... couldn't believe it was true. The press soon learned that I shared that info with Margaryan. Three days later a journalist asked Margaryan if he could comment on that. Margaryan claimed he knew nothing about it. These peoples' urge to preserve power, to remain close to power, was stronger. 

I stand behind my words, I answer in front of God, and I have a responsibility toward our public.

**REPORTER:** If Vazgen Sargsyan and Karen Demirchyan were the main barriers against the Meghri plan, why didn't the government proceed with the plan after their death?

**SARGSYAN:** The resistance continued by Vagharshak Harutyunyan [ex-MOD] and me. As a result, I got fired while Vagharshak lost his title as general. They took him to court. We were persecuted after disclosing the fact that this wasn't a Goble-US plan, but rather a Russo-Turkish scheme. This is the Lenin-Ataturk agreement of our era. Today, Russia again wants to have control of the roads.

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan claims that Kocharyan removed Artsakh from the negotiation table.

**SARGSYAN:** But do you know WHY Robert Kocharyan was brought to Armenia in the first place? It wasn't Vazgen ""instructing"" Levon to do so, despite what some people believe. Here is how things unfolded:

Levon Ter-Petrosyan would sometimes visit Artsakh for negotiations and reach an agreement. Upon his return, however, Artsakh would usually break the agreement. An impression eventually formed that it was all just a double game to buy time. 

So what did Russia do? They decided to promote a ""Shurik"" figure: *the man who gets in our way, will become our man*. That Shurik was Robert Kocharyan. Russia advised Levon to bring Kocharyan to Armenia. Russia also advised Kocharyan to accept the title of prime minister in Armenia. 
Russia had a resolution plan beneficial to itself and needed Armenians to play along.

**REPORTER:** After firing you and Vagharshak Harutyunyan, what prevented Kocharyan from realizing the exchange plan?

**SARGSYAN:** By then it was already too late. The topic became taboo. Had Kocharyan signed it, he would confirm the theory that Vazgen and Karen sacrificed their lives to block the plan. 

MFA Vardan Oskanyan met the US State Secretary and begged them to ""remove the Meghri exchange plan from the negotiation table"". The Secretary asked, ""Why, Vardan, wasn't it your plan?"" Vardan claimed it wasn't, but now is the right time for him to come clean if he loves his homeland. I don't want to disclose any more details from private meetings with Oskanyan but this information belongs to the public and eventually, the recorded audiotape will be officially released to the public domain.

**REPORTER:** What tapes?

**SARGSYAN:** From Oskanyan's meeting with the US Secretary.

##commentary by political analysts Karen Sargsyan and Chibukhchyan / Ukraine war / Artsakh / new metallurgical plant

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Armenian and Azeri delegations will meet in Washington again next week. Azerbaijan has been trying to derail these negotiations by firing at the partially US-owned metallurgical plant that is currently being built on the AM-AZ border. Azerbaijan's calculation was to receive harsh criticism from the US and to use that as an excuse to cancel the planned meeting in Washington *[just as they accused France of bias and said they wouldn't meet Macron in the past]*. Azerbaijan's hooliganism against the US plant coincided with the somewhat widespread belief, at least at the time, that the Ukrainian counteroffensive was failing. Nevertheless, the US maintained its diplomatic posture and they dragged Azeri MFA to the UK to have a ""chat"" with him.

**SARGSYAN:** The shots at the US plant were pursuing the second goal as well. Azeris wanted to persuade the US to recall the employees working on the plant. Their efforts failed, partly thanks to the UK. The UK has been silently helping Armenia despite many of our citizens, who are under Russian media influence, being generally ungrateful towards the UK. People keep dragging the UK through the mud because of British Petroleum's presence in Azerbaijan while forgetting that the British royal investments are in Shell, not BP, and Shell has announced the opening of a branch in Armenia. 

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Besides that, Russia has multiple companies with a share in Azerbaijan's Shah Denis gas field. They play a far greater role than the British BP, when you calculate their shares.

Something is silently brewing in Ukraine's southern front. Russian MoD Shoygu is publicly concerned about Crimea, there are talks about blowing up the Zaporozhya NPP, Biden says a nuke use is a real possibility,  and...

**SARGSYAN:** Ukrainians are already on the outskirts of Tokmak. 

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Yes, there are battles and a fog of war. Prigozhin reported infiltration and expressed hope that it was just a small group of Ukrainians. We will have a more clear picture in the coming days. Azerbaijan will not take well the weakening of its ally Moscow on the battlefield. 

**SARGSYAN:** Russia and Azerbaijan signed a strategic alliance agreement just 2 days before the invasion of Ukraine. But there is another important event not widely reported by the press. Azerbaijan's state-run SOCAR energy agency had asked the Ukrainian government for a permit to demine southern Ukraine. Just a month before the invasion, Azeris demined the area near the Ukraine-Crimea line of contact.

Azeris demined Ukraine's Chongar area. You've probably seen that name on the news lately. Ukraine has just struck bridges there to hinder the movement of Russian supplies.

Azerbaijan's demining of Chongar led to the destruction of Ukraine's defenses. That agreement was signed in 2016 under Petro Poroshenko. This story was circulated in Ukraine last year and there were calls to investigate the circumstances. It placed Azerbaijan in a difficult situation.

More recently, I received materials from Ukraine showing displeasure towards Azerbaijan among Ukrainian volunteer army units. They accuse Azerbaijan of lying about the volume of aid to Ukraine. Aliyev had promised large volumes of kerosene as a gift but never delivered anything close. 

But that's nothing compared to Chongar demining. Once the Ukrainian public learns about the pre-war events, they will want to impale SOCAR on a stick.

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** To put it simply, Russia was able to easily invade southern Ukraine in the early days partly because Azerbaijan had purchased areas north of Crimea and demined it.

**SARGSYAN:** Basically, Azerbaijan and Russia exchanged Kherson for Karabakh. Putin gifted Karabakh to Aliyev, then Aliyev gifted Kherson and Zaporozhya to Putin.

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Will Azerbaijan continue to fire at the US metal plant in Armenia? 

**SARGSYAN:** It depends on how soon Putin leaves this world. As long as that bastard is alive, Azerbaijan will continue to provoke.

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Does the US plant act as a ""barrier"" against Azerbaijan?

**SARGSYAN:** It's basically AzovStal [a complex metallurgy plant that Russians captured only after wasting lots of time and manpower]. It's not a flatland anymore, it's not going to be suited for a tank advance anymore. When the plant is ready, it'll become a mini-castle. You place a battalion or two, with Kornets or similar anti-vehicle weapons, and they can defend the area. This area used to be defenseless.

Azeris weren't aware that foreign workers were building the plant. They created a diplomatic mess for themselves after wounding those two Indian workers. I don't think they will aim at the workers anymore. Minor ""hooliganism"" against the building is expected.

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Armenia is actively promoting the US-led negotiations. In order to save Meghri, Armenia is doing everything possible to remove Armenia from the Artsakh-Azerbaijan conflict while securing a Western-led platform for a dialogue between Artsakh and Azerbaijan. [Russia and the pro-Russian officials in Artsakh are against this.]

With that said, yesterday Artsakh's presidential adviser [and ex-MFA] Davit Babayan called for the reunification of Artsakh with Armenia. He wants to derail the entire diplomatic effort by keeping Armenia as a party to the conflict. The calls for ""reunification"" sounds sweet for the keyboard patriots and the Russian agents. In reality, it's a treacherous call that is meant to serve Russian interests. Davit Babayan wants Armenia to surrender Meghri so Russian peacekeepers can stay in Artsakh.

**SARGSYAN:** Davit Babayan is dead to me after his conduct during the 2020 war and his screeching interview about Shushi.
At one point he even developed an attitude against France for wanting to recognize Artsakh as an independent state.

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Officials from the EU, US, and PACE have recently criticized Azerbaijan. The resolution adopted by PACE matched Pashinyan's texts almost word by word. 

**SARGSYAN:** Do you know who hosted PACE? Who was the speaker?

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Ukraine's Oleksiy Goncharenko. He even posted the results on his personal page. Let this be a lesson for anyone in Armenia who has been spreading Russian propaganda about the phosphorus bombs used by Azerbaijan being ""sold by Ukraine"", etc.

PACE heavily relied on the international World Court's ruling against Azerbaijan on the blockade of the Lachin corridor. This is why every diplomatic achievement is important. It builds up. Azerbaijan will not be able to ""legalize"" its Lachin blockade until it enters into negotiations with the Artsakh population. 
This is akin to the 1993 UNSC resolution against Armenian forces, but now Azerbaijan is on the receiving end.

Moreover, the US Congress organized a hearing to debate the situation in Artsakh. Not only there were calls to end the US military aid to Azerbaijan, but they went as far as to urge Israel to do the same.

**SARGSYAN:** There is a myth that the Israeli lobby in the US is actively working against Armenians. You personally know this isn't true. The Israeli lobby has always been balanced. Jewish Rep. and Sen. have a track record of pro-Armenian work. The roots of antisemitism in Armenia originate in Russia. Every historical tragedy apparently is the fault of Anglo-Saxons and Jews, according to Russia. Russia shares 50% of the blame for the Armenian Genocide, but they won't admit that. When I talk to Turks today, they tell me, ""Can we just assume responsibility for our half?"". There is a reason why Russia isn't allowing us to sit around a table for direct talks. Russia has extensive archives. If Russia fully declassifies the communication between Kemal Ataturk and the Red Square's rotten resident Lenin, our historians will be in for a shock.

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Kansas National Guard chief and the governor of Kansas are in Armenia. 

**SARGSYAN:** Yes. This is the second meeting in recent times. Today I can finally say that we are able to promote commanders with NATO standards in our military. I can't disclose everything, but I know these boys, I observe them.

Our MOD Papikyan also visited France. He was one of the main guests, he was traveling with French MOD and French army commanders. I don't know if it was a coincidence that the French press printed photos of weapons that we've long been suggesting that Armenia needs. The French navy can't climb the Armenian mountains, but Rafales can descend pretty well.

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** But we can't have Western weapons while being a CSTO member [Russian circle].

**SARGSYAN:** Yes we can. Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan have military bases not belonging to Russia. We can sign an agreement with France to open a NATO base in Armenia. The US's effort in our region is aimed at containing Turkey's destructive role, and Iran. There is a geopolitical mantra that you need 3 points of leverage on the ground. For the US and West, those points could be Greece, Cyprus, and Armenia.

**CHIBUKHCHYAN:** Moreover, we're witnessing the formation of a new military trio: India-Greece-Cyprus. Armenia should join their military exercises.

**REUTERS:** There is an EU diplomatic service paper prepared by the European External Action Service.

It states that the EU could gradually reconsider political engagement, financial assistance, and sectoral cooperation with Azerbaijan after the events in Nagorno-Karabakh.

The document reflects a balance of different positions of member states. Some countries wanted more [tougher stance on Azerbaijan], while others didn't want anything at all.

Pro-Armenian: France, Germany, Netherlands.

Pro-Azerbaijan: Hungary, Austria.

The EU might not be able to sanction Azerbaijan, but it could instead support Armenia economically and possibly militarily.

The EU is considering ""political and economic actions to further support the democratically elected authorities of Armenia, including in the area of security and resilience, and the continuation of the democratic reforms.""

There was supposed to be an AM-AZ meeting on the sidelines of the European Political Community’s gathering. Leaders of various states are expected to visit Granada.

The AM-AZ meeting was going to be hosted by France, Germany, and the EU.

Ilham Aliyev rejected the meeting because of France's pro-Armenian stance and Germany’s disagreement on Turkey's participation in the AM-AZ meeting.

Turkey's President Erdogan later announced he would not attend the Granada summit at all because of ""health reasons"".

##interview with military analyst Leonid Nersisyan

**LEONID:** Not the first time Azerbaijan boycotts a Western platform because of France. Last time they found a way to address the disagreements. But we should not rule out a military aggression by Azerbaijan by the end of this month, before the snowy season.

**REPORTER:** Why do you often refer to Russia as an ""ally"" in quotation marks?

**LEONID:** No one has doubts that the Nagorno-Karabakh leaders were strongly pro-Russian. Russian peacekeepers could have easily evacuated them with their helicopters but they chose to allow Azerbaijan to arrest the leaders. Somehow Russia always keeps its promises towards Azerbaijan, but can't do that for Armenia. ""Rossiya svoix ~~ne~~ brosayet."" [Russia ~~does not abandon~~ abandons its allies.]

**REPORTER:** What weapons can France deliver to Armenia?

**LEONID:** Expensive but good quality weapons. For example, the French air defense is better than India's. But even something like opening the access to the French market of components could be a huge boost for Armenia. Installing French optics, engine, or laser tech on Armenian drones could drastically improve them.

Establishing ties with France could also simplify negotiations with other European countries. It'll be easier to deal with Europe than with the U.S.

**REPORTER:** How would this compare to Russian weapons?

**LEONID:** Comparing is pointless because Russian weapon isn't available anymore. Russian weapons have been traditionally viewed as a good bang for the buck [no pun intended]. Armenia is replacing them with Indian weapons. When it comes to expensive but definitely tested and higher-quality weapons, the West is where you can find them. Armenia should be selective and only buy from the West what India cannot provide.

**REPORTER:** Could the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army soldiers join the Armenian army?

**LEONID:** Yes. They could form a brigade or a division made of NK DA personnel who already know each other. Their performance on September 19 was not bad despite the capitulation. The Azeri army sustained over 700 casualties in a single day *[officially confirmed: >200 dead, >500 wounded]*. Obviously, the NK army could not have won because they were encircled and under a blockade.

**REPORTER:** Will Armenia leave the CSTO?

**LEONID:** Armenia's actions to establish closer ties to the West could eventually lead to the freezing of its relations with CSTO, similar to Uzbekistan. Why leave it officially if you can have a similar effect without further angering Russia, especially since I haven't heard of any alternative offers made to Armenia?

##U.S. responds to Armenia's ratification of Rome Statute 

**STATE DEPT:** We respect Armenia’s sovereignty and independence, and we’ll leave it to Armenia’s Government to comment on its legislative processes. We have been encouraged by many states, including Armenia, that have undertaken commitments to promote justice and accountability.

**REPORTER:** We have seen increasing rhetoric coming out of Russia, threatening Armenia for the very step it has taken. Will the U.S. step up and defend Armenia against potential Russian aggression, either directly through its army or through its proxy forces, like there are reports about Wagner being present?

**STATE DEPT:** That is quite the hypothetical. I don’t want to get into it. What I will say, though, is that the U.S. is going to continue to play a role in engaging with Azerbaijani and Armenian leadership at the highest levels to pursue a dignified and durable peace.

We reiterate our call for a longer-term, independent, international monitoring mission in Nagorno-Karabakh to provide transparency and reassurances that the rights and securities of ethnic Armenians will be protected. //

##who is the representative (commandant) of Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh?

Azeri media writes that Sargis Galstyan has been appointed as Baku's representative in Nagorno-Karabakh. Galstyan is the uncle of a Nagorno-Karabakh Parliament MP representing a party run by the former regime (now the new regime).

**Galstyan's nephew (MP):** I cannot confirm or deny the report. We saw him last time on September 28th. He said he'd remain in Nagorno-Karabakh to take care of others. //

Sargis Galstyan is a relative of Bako Sahakyan, the former president of Nagorno-Karabakh. He held various government positions in the past. He was the manager of the ""Avan Shushi Plaza"" hotel in Shushi.

##the West secretly sought help from Russia to open the Lachin corridor, days before Azerbaijan's aggression

**POLITICO:** The meeting was a rare sign of diplomacy between Putin and the West on a high-level security topic, while regular ties have been upended by war.

The meeting took place on September 17 in Istanbul as part of efforts to pressure Azerbaijan to end its nine-month blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh. The meeting focused on “how to get the bloody trucks moving”.

The meeting took place between Louis Bono (US), Toivo Klaar (EU), and  Igor Khovaev (RU). Such high-level diplomatic interaction is rare. 

An EU official said, “we believe it is important to maintain channels of communications with relevant interlocutors to avoid misunderstandings.”  Klaar had sought to keep lines open on numerous fronts over the “past years,” including in talks with Khovaev and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.

A U.S. official said, “We need to be able to work with the Russians on this because they do have influence over the parties."" //

The meeting was followed by the entry of a few trucks into Nagorno-Karabakh. A day later Azerbaijan attacked.

**Foreign Ministry of Russia:** The US and EU asked us to hold a meeting to discuss the situation. We exchanged our positions. //

##interview with analyst Karen Sargsyan \\ AM-FR relations \\ Kidnapping of Nagorno-Karabakh leaders 

**REPORTER:** What weapons should we expect from France: Optical devices, vests, and similar things, or heavier weapons?

**KAREN:** We should not discuss this openly right now.

**REPORTER:** Could they arrive by the end of this year?

**KAREN:** Yes.

**REPORTER:** France did not demand Armenia to formally exit the CSTO as a precondition, according to FM Mirzoyan. 

**KAREN:** They never make demands but you have to read between the lines and understand the offer. The only ones making ""demands"" are the horses hooked on cocaine, like Sergey Lavrov.

**REPORTER:** How do you explain the recent high-profile visits by U.S. and French officials?

**KAREN:** Azerbaijan broke the promise not to attack Nagorno-Karabakh. It's an insult to the West. Aliyev and its backers will eventually pay for it. 2) They view Armenia as the eastern border of Europe and part of European civilization. 3) They need a Suez 2.0 route connecting Armenia, Iran, and India. 4) They don't want Big Turan and rising Russian influence over communication routes.

**REPORTER:** France has asked the EU to increase the number of border observers and to expand their legal mandate. What can you tell us about it?

**KAREN:** The technical details aren't clear yet. So far there is a political decision by France. Germany will likely join them. If it's an EU-level initiative, it might pass if Aliyev's girlfriend Viktor Orban doesn't block it.

**REPORTER:** Will Azerbaijan attempt to promote the ""Zangezur corridor"" during the Granada meeting?

**KAREN:** Syunem that corridor. It's a dead topic that appears only in Russia's wet dreams. Even Turkey is giving up on it [and choosing a route via Iran instead]. This reaffirms the suspicions that Russia was the main backer of this corridor. It was drafted and promoted primarily by Russia. 

**REPORTER:** Is the Nov. 9 document irrelevant now?

**KAREN:** The Nov. 9 Statement has never held a legal power and has never been ratified anywhere. Everything that took place after the signing of that Statement was based on the decisions made by state leaders. Nagorno-Karabakh leadership agreed to a ceasefire under those conditions and with the personal reassurances of Vladimir Vladimirich Putin, whose word they believed 4 times stronger than Jesus's, which is why they have been crucified. They ignored Russia's surrender of their territories to Azerbaijan after the ceasefire, the surrender of Berdzor, Parukh, and Aghavno. They instead held a sign reading *""Thank you Russia!""*.

**REPORTER:** Why didn't the West prevent the attack on Nagorno-Karabakh?

**KAREN:** Because Nagorno-Karabakh leaders were Russian puppets and had no moral right to demand or expect anything from the West, with the exception of begging for food. The politicians who adopted the Spasiba Rossiya, spasiba Putin, May 9 hurrah, ""Z"" and other garbage should have demanded things from Russia instead, not the West. Why would the West help Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, when the former has provided military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, while the latter intentionally positioned itself in the Russian camp? Didn't the government of Nagorno-Karabakh congratulate Russia on the annexation of Donbas? Did they think they could get away with this? 

How many times did the West invite Nagorno-Karabakh leadership to take part in Western-led negotiations? *[The U.S. offered its mediation. Russia did not want Nagorno-Karabakh to accept it. Russia leaked the information about that offer and claimed it was a ""blackmail"" by the West to discredit it. Nagorno-Karabakh leadership turned down the first offer under Russian pressure.]*

3 Dec 2022: Azerbaijan shuts down the Lachin corridor.

4 Dec 2022: The corridor is open again, but briefly.

7 Dec 2022: President Arayik leaves Nagorno-Karabakh and visits France. Russia is concerned over Arayik-West relations.

12 Dec 2022: Russia and Azerbaijan close the Lachin after Arayik's return. He is ""locked up"" from that point on. 

**REPORTER:** How did the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh get arrested by Azerbaijani police yesterday?

**KAREN:** They were arrested in Ivanyan, which means Russian peacekeepers likely handed them over [there is a Russian base in Ivanyan, that's where NK-RU-AZ negotiations often take place]. From what I've heard, they went to Ivanyan to take a Russian helicopter to reach Armenia. Idiots trusted Russia again. 

**REPORTER:** Why has Azerbaijan arrested all the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh? 

**KAREN:** Aliyev wants to sentence them to prison before issuing an amnesty to show the international community how ""kind"" he is. He views it as a tool to ease the criticism. This could backfire because international actors have met many of these arrested individuals and view them as diplomatic figures who should not have been arrested to begin with. If you want to arrest political figures, you have to take them to the Hague.

**REPORTER:** Who is Sargis Galstyan, Azerbaijan's ""commandant"" in Nagorno-Karabakh? Reports suggest he is a close associate of ex-president Bako Sahakyan from anti-Pashinyan circles. 

**KAREN:** His background suggests he was formerly engaged in civic society activities to bring peace between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. But he is undoubtedly an agent of a foreign state [Russia]. 

**REPORTER:** Isn't there a risk he might provide sensitive information to Azerbaijani authorities? 

**KAREN:** Every one of the arrested officials could. The more the society calls itself patriotic, speaks against women who color their hair, and rejects Western values, the more idiotic that society is, and the easier it is to manipulate it. It's easier for a foreign agent to infiltrate these types of societies because all the agent has to do to become trusted is to suggest that women should not wear short skirts. We've seen a lot of degenerates, we've gone through the 2020 war. What do these collaborators deserve? Can't say it out loud, but you know exactly what.

**REPORTER:** Commandant Galstyan's relative worked as a journalist in Armenia and repeatedly targeted the more or less reasonable officials from Nagorno-Karabakh, and also spread anti-Western and anti-George Soros propaganda in Armenia. 

**KAREN:** Regarding the collaborators in the Nagorno-Karabakh government who signed the capitulation. Their properties should be confiscated in Armenia. If they disclose any state secrets while under arrest in Baku, they better stay in Azerbaijan and serve their time there. 

Nagorno-Karabakh residents' mistake was trusting Russia. 

**REPORTER:** But you can tell that refugees are anti-Russian now.

**KAREN:** I'm not sure yet. It will take time for people to admit they were wrong. They need to live and work for 3-5 years without heavy stress in order to rehabilitate and start making decisions. 

Nagorno-Karabakh's government miscalculated in 2018. After the Armenian revolution of 2018 and the anti-Armenian rhetoric adopted by the Russian media, the government of Nagorno-Karabakh decided to ignore Armenia and speak directly with Russia. 

**REPORTER:** Why?

**KAREN:** Because for many years a lie was spread and solidified in Nagorno-Karabakh claiming that Armenia did not help Nagorno-Karabakh win the 1st war and that they won only thanks to Russia. The mother of the motherfucker who spread that narrative deserves to be nailed against a wall. 

**REPORTER:** The pro-Russian opposition in Armenia cheered the forced removal of President Arayik Harutyunyan, lauding Russia as a true ally of Nagorno-Karabakh. The latest lie is that Arayik left voluntarily. He did not. They quickly forgot how Tatar Rubo made a big scene from the church's backyard, criticizing Arayik for refusing to resign. This coup was a self-inflicted wound. Today they are engaged in the heroization of Rubo on the streets of Yerevan.

**KAREN:** Speaking of Tatar Rubo. The real motive behind his arrest could be his business background in Russia. [Pro-Kremlin Azeri businessman] God Nisanov would love to corner Rubo and extract things from him. Rubo has a foundation in Switzerland tasked with the education of children of Russian oligarchs. This is a serious business. They might go after it.

Rubo's business was somewhat on the decline. Morgan Stanley offered him $16 billion for his Troika Dialogue business in 2007. He turned down the offer. A year later he sold it to Russian Sberbank for only $0.9 billion. 

**REPORTER:** What will the ratification of the Rome Statute give Armenia?

**KAREN:** Normally the UN expresses ""concerns"" but doesn't act. The ICC was created so that in rare and severe instances, when a ""concern"" isn't enough, they can refer the case to the ICC to take action. There are two main courts: the World Court and ICC. The ICC is where they tried Milosevic.  

**REPORTER:** When asked why she refrained from describing the events in Nagorno-Karabakh as ""ethnic cleansing"", the French FM basically responded by urging Armenia to present the evidence to the ICC, now that we have ratified it. Could the Rome Statute restrain Ilham Aliyev?

**KAREN:** No, not Aliyev personally. The president of Rwanda, the organizer of the genocide, was not ""found"". But this will have an impact on the Azerbaijani ruling class in general. It's difficult to sanction the leader himself, but the lower-ranking officials and army leaders could easily find themselves on wanted lists. Moreover, they understand that Aliyev wouldn't hesitate to throw them under the bus. There have already been criminal cases and purges in the Azeri army for unrelated reasons. 

**REPORTER:** What's going on with the church leadership in Armenia?

**KAREN:** Armenians love symbolism. If you spot an Armenian in an open field and install a door in front of him, he will stand in front of the door forever. Armenians love pointless symbols. Who is this Catholicos if not an idiot and a serial candle merchant? He summoned archbishops and urged them to [join the pro-Russian political forces to help remove Pashinyan]. We know who Catholicos's brother is and how he made his fortune. 

Azeris toppled the giant metal cross in Stepanakert. The internet was engulfed in a big vaynasun and grief. You look at the amount of metal wasted on it and realize how many frontline positions they could have reinforced with it. Was building that cross more important?

Vaay vooy babo dedo sculpture will be destroyed next. ""How can it be, we took photos under it!"" There is too much symbolism and not enough substance in the Armenian mentality. People have to see something in order to value it and identify with it. This is why I was pissed when Vahan Kerobyan decided to help Gagik Tsarukyan build the statue of Christ. Why don't you build a factory instead? Why don't you donate it to the state so they can buy more weapons?

##Russia has a new player in Armenia's internal politics 

The former deputy army commander and MOD Arshak Karapetyan promises to be a serious political force in Armenia.

He dedicated a quarter of his intro speech to praising Russia, another quarter to reminding you how awful Nikol is, another quarter to complain about getting fired by Nikol, and the remaining quarter to praise his army management skills.

He was fired in 2016 by Serj Sargsyan after the army's failures during the 2016 April war. He was re-appointed and then replaced by Nikol in 2021 after the army's failures on the AM-AZ border.

He was also tasked with gathering intel data for the army.

##Pashinyan appoints the first head of Armenia's newly established Foreign Intelligence Service

After the 2020 war, the government decided to create a new foreign intel service amid shortcomings of the traditionally Russian-friendly NSS service and the army's intel wing.

##... who is Kristine Grigoryan, the first head of the agency?

2004-2014: Legal specialist at Parliament, assistant to MPs.

2014-2015: Led a team as part of the USAID-funded program ""Support to the Development of Institutional Capacities of the Parliament""

2016: National human rights expert at the Council of Europe (later as Human Rights Ombudsman under Pashinyan admin.)

2018: Adviser to Ararat Mirzoyan (now FM)

2019: Deputy Justice Minister 

##... about the Foreign Intelligence Service

**REPORTER:** This appointment marks the inception of the FIS. What functions will the service carry out?

**PASHINYAN OFFICE:** The FIS will predict foreign threats and provide political decision-makers with relevant reliable intelligence data. 
The FIS will closely cooperate with actors inside and outside of Armenia to strengthen the independence and sovereignty of Armenia. 

**REPORTER:** Why is it launching now?

**PASHINYAN OFFICE:** It's part of the Government's plan to reform the security sector. The plan was approved in December 2022.

**REPORTER:** Which country's service model was chosen as the foundation of the service?

**PASHINYAN OFFICE:** In our discussions, we were guided exclusively by the principles of assessing the security challenges and foreign intelligence needs of Armenia and developing a modern foreign intelligence service quintessential to a democratic society.

##Q&A with PM Pashinyan in Parliament 

**Pro-Russian opposition MP:** You abandoned Nagorno-Karabakh and allowed it to be attacked. You claim the attack was a result of the internal political changes in Nagorno-Karabakh. You are the puppet of Azerbaijan.

**PASHINYAN:** I'm not going to get lectured by your puppet political party about being someone's puppet. You couldn't even sneeze without permission. 

I wouldn't like to speak about my Nagorno-Karabakh colleagues right now, many of whom have been illegally arrested, but I must mention that your faction put a target on Nagorno-Karabakh's back. We remember how you celebrated the ousting of the Nagorno-Karabakh government. You described the process as the people of Nagorno-Karabakh slamming their fists on the table and finally forming a national government. You congratulated this process and stated that the ""time has come to save Nagorno-Karabakh"". 

Everything went according to your plan. ""Look what's going to happen now,"" you said from this podium. What happened is exactly what you planned, but only partially. Your main plan was to drag Armenia into a major war so [Armenia would lose territories and] the Nagorno-Karabakh refugees couldn't even live in Yerevan, so they'd be forced to move straight to Los Angeles and Paris to fill the thinning ranks of ARF. That is your policy. Do not lecture us now. 

##... about Granada meeting

**Ruling MP:** You are going to meet Aliyev in Granada tomorrow. What are the expectations?

**PASHINYAN:** We had high expectations and hoped to sign an important document. This is the document that the opposition presented as ""treason"". They even wanted to block the airport to prevent me from signing it. 

The opposition's efforts failed, and we maintained our strong will, but sadly Azerbaijan has canceled the meeting. Let's record the following: the puppet opposition won't get their bonus paychecks because it wasn't them who derailed this meeting. 

But we will still be present in Granada. We will present our stance. Hopefully, we will sign a document ASAP. Sadly it won't happen tomorrow.

**MP:** Does this destroy the narrative that the [Western-hosted] negotiations are anti-Armenian? Otherwise, why would Azerbaijan reject it?

**PASHINYAN:** The document is neither anti-Azerbaijan nor anti-Armenian. It must be balanced so both sides can sign it. However the problem is that certain foreign forces see an opportunity to use marginalized puppets to derail these efforts.

##... the peace agreement 

**MP:** Were you hoping/planning to sign any document in Granada?

**PASHINYAN:** We need the following: 1) AM and AZ recognize one another's territorial integrity with a specific km^2 number. 2) Alma-Ata Declaration and the 1975 or some newer maps are used for demarcating borders. 3) Regional trade routes open without violating the host states' sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The aforementioned 3 principles cover 70% of the peace agreement. This 70% is the hardest part. Azerbaijan keeps rejecting those principles. I'm ready to sign that document right at this moment. This is what we were supposed to discuss in Granada.

##... ""lowering the bar"" for Nagorno-Karabakh's status was a joint strategy between Yerevan and Stepanakert: Pashinyan  

**PASHINYAN:** I couldn't answer the question about ""lowering the bar"" earlier for objective reasons. I'll reveal the details now, although I still have doubts whether this is a good idea, but the public deserves to know.

Yes, we lowered the bar, and here is the secret: it was done with the knowledge of our Nagorno-Karabakh colleagues and with a prior agreement. 

But here is what happened instead: we lowered the bar but Nagorno-Karabakh proceeded to increase the bar [nothing less than full de jure independence]. They did so under the pressure of your faction [opposition parties in Armenia].

Had the Nagorno-Karabakh government followed our pre-approved plan, it wouldn't end like this. We were headed towards achieving the consolidation of the international community's support. 

You know very well what happened. [The West] offered Nagorno-Karabakh to meet Azerbaijan. Why did they reject it? Don't we want to know? Because someone PREVENTED Nagorno-Karabakh from accepting the [Western] offer. Who prohibited them? Everyone pretends they don't know [sarcastic smile]. //

So far all of these things should be known by probably everyone here

>Azerbaijan is showed up greedy for Iran's maritime and land borders and strongly supports separatist activities inside Iran. The threat is increasing day by day due to the presence of a population of several million Azeri-speaking ethnic groups in Iran, among a group of whom separatist propaganda and falsification of historical identity have been widespread and credible.

All of these are known for decades, now RoA has become a zionist-nest and multiple reports surfaced they let them station F-35 fighter jets there, also a Hermes drones intercepted is believed or confirmed to come from the RoA and many others in 2 years.

RoA wants to buy anti-missile systems from Zionists, they seem to be afraid of something.

Last time when Iran missiled the fortress in Erbil, they actually took an earth penetrating warhead which destroyed some kind of concrete wall looking like a basement, this has been covered by many OSINT.

The threat is coming for sure from the north, not only some 2cents mossad bases in Iraq, RoA is surely hosting the same things and even more and without worrying of a strike, since Iran (for the moment) cannot strike RoA, first because it would be a big excuse for the west to attack Iran or bring more sanctions, and second Iran and RoA aren't at ""war"" and that it could make things worse.

Anyone knows, beside the drills done on the borders, what is the IR position on this? The real problem is that messing up would just make their propaganda work against Iranian Azeris and that is the main goal of RoA and Turkey, make Iranian azeris take side with them if Iran take the (possible) bait. I could only speculate intelligence operations are ongoing from the two sides.

So far what are the things: 

\- RoA is hosting zionists.

\- RoA is letting zionists build drone bases and maybe even letting them use their airfields [https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/iran-shoots-down-israeli-drone-operated-by-azerbaijan-violating-iranian-airspace.687616/](https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/iran-shoots-down-israeli-drone-operated-by-azerbaijan-violating-iranian-airspace.687616/) 

\- RoA(and turkey by effect) spreads constant anti-Iranian propaganda and rewrites history compulsively (this is not only done on Iran but even western countries like France) based mostly on early soviet propaganda which can sound credible to some, RoA teach people from young age to hate Iran and teach them history in their own way.

\- RoA seeks to buy more Zionist weaponry (they are maybe even given for free since Zionist gets a jackpot standing there).

\- Zionists uses RoA to get intelligence from Iran.

\- All of this probably led to the death of Iranians, in Iran.

>It is necessary to carry out extensive and continuous monitoring, surveillance and reconnaissance operations in all areas north of Aras, especially in the terrain of the corridor. Suppress any suspicious movement with the heaviest firepower, stifle any possible response with the most severe actions. If it is necessary to drop a 50 lb bomb from a UAV to eliminate a suspicious target, that target must get vanished by spending two 2000 lb bombs dropped from a fighter. If a small rocket can stop the terrorists on the border, heavy and powerful missiles must get used that project the seriousness and determination of the Islamic Republic of Iran in ensuring national security and the fight against terrorism. These measures should be such that if the other side retaliates by firing a mortar shell at a border checkpoint, then expects a government building in Baku to be burnt to ashes by ballistic and cruise missiles

I go to them, to learn more about the conflict, and i see that these resolutions directly contradict everything their top MOD post says.  I asked why the top post lies about the resolutions and I was banned.

Thus, the Azerbaijani publications [Day.az](https://news.day.az/politics/1411755.html) and [Haqqin.az](https://Haqqin.az), citing allegedly Armenian media, misinformed about discussions by Pashinyan and extra-parliamentary political forces on the termination of Armenia's membership in the CSTO and Eurasian Economic Union.

No evidence whatsoever. Only a spatial phrase: ""There is reason to believe that this information is likely to correspond to reality"".

Telegram channels covering events in Armenia are baited by spreading this ""insider"" information as criticism of the policy of Prime Minister Pashinyan, without checking its reliability. This is how informational stuffing reaches its intended audience.

Youtube channels are an audiovisual way of spreading fakes. One of which is the Russian language [""News from Azerbaijan and Armenia""](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDiRbLkrJi6JKccD-wKEzdw).

This stuffing is also posted on dubious resources covering events around Russia.

Azerbaijan works on two information fronts. On the one hand, it convinces the Armenian population of the notorious betrayal of Russia and discredits unfavorable tripartite agreements. On the other hand, it spreads stuffing about the betrayal of the leadership of Armenia to Russia and the pro-European orientation.

By spreading tales about the political divorce of Armenia and Russia, Azerbaijani propaganda convinces mainly its own population of them.

Meanwhile, the meeting of the Consultative Assembly on Cooperation with Extra-Parliamentary Political Forces was held for the fifth time. The government's dialogue with the opposition is gaining momentum. It has never happened in the history of modern Armenia. The majority understands that state interests are higher than internecine warfare.

We need to get used to information pressure and learn to recognize it by developing critical thinking and paying attention to sources. The danger is that fakes multiply in the Russian language. And under their influence, respectively, falls the population of Russia. At all times Turks were interested in the Armenian-Russian enmity. But now they are particularly interested in it, because the Kremlin's position enables Yerevan to confront the Neo-ottoman ambitions of Baku and Ankara."

##Pashinyan about the Nagorno Karabakh negotiation process and the ""diplomatic disaster"" of 2016:

Throughout the negotiation process, NK has never been viewed as a territory where only Armenians would live. The issue of the Azeri population has been part of the negotiations. 

The referendum was never going to be held according to our liking, but even if it were, NK's Azeri population would also take part. Now the question is, would the Azeris of NK, in their turn, be allowed to [break away from NK via a similar process]. What would happen if that question was raised? These are not abstract questions. It's based on the nuances of what was on the negotiation table, which has never been discussed in public.

Today we hear voices, thoughts, and cherrypicked sentences that, in fact, have nothing to do with the package of negotiations that we had as of 2018.

&nbsp;

3 packages were offered in 2016, and for the first time since 2011, NK's interim status was not part of it. Sure, NK would have a legislature, judiciary, etc. But no one is mentioning that the issue of clarifying NK's interim status, according to that negotiation logic, was transferred to the UN Security Council. What is the problem with that?

Throughout the entire negotiation process, Armenia attempted to keep the final resolution within the OSCE Minsk Group framework. In 2016 the parameters to solve the issue were transferred to the UN Security Council. 

Pay attention to Levon Ter-Petrosyan's 2017 interview to H1. He mentions that the international community will decide NK's status. 

[What decision would the UN Security Council make?] The question is, part of which country will NK remain before its final status is resolved? When it's the UN Security Council handling it, the outcome is very predictable, because in 1993 they adopted a resolution stating that NK is part of Azerbaijan and that they recognize Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. 

This is the 2016 disaster. Under this logic, NK's final resolution must be handled per the Azerbaijani constitution. 

**Reporter:** NK has never been part of independent Azerbaijan. Are you saying the UN Security Council accepts NK as part of Azerbaijan? 

**Pashinyan:** Yes. The documents are open for everyone to read.

**Reporter:** what happened between 2016-2018, and after 2018?

**Pashinyan:** Serj Sargsyan revealed that the negotiation process didn't inspire hope, more specifically it had been suspended, because Azerbaijan's expectations were unrealistic and unacceptable for us. 

**Reporter:** is the issue about UN Security Council still on the table?

**Pashinyan:** there are OSCE meetings to continue the negotiations. After the war, we must develop an agenda. Co-chairs proposed one that is acceptable to us. 

##Pashinyan about 2011-2016 process getting progressively worse for Armenia:

Kazan documents were quite good for us, and they included an interim status for NK. Armenia went to sign it. Azerbaijan refused, and started purchasing lots of weapons instead. 

In 2013 Azerbaijan escalates the conflict. In 2014 the conflict deepens. We start to see the first signs of OSCE pressuring Armenia to reject interim status for NK, but Armenia refuses. Military clashes get worse in 2015. 

**And in January of 2016**, OSCE officially present a new package to Armenia, which officially excludes NK's interim status. This was January. Armenia refuses. The war begins in April. OSCE makes a similar proposal in July. Armenia rejects again. In August the OSCE presents a new and disastrous document about the UN Security Council that I spoke about. 

&nbsp;

Serj could have avoided the 2016 war had he at least responded with a more flexible *""okay I'll think about it""* when pressured about removing NK's interim status in January. They had experienced diplomats. 

After the April 2016 war, an event was held in Sayat Nova (Ararat) dedicated to disabled people. I was invited. Arkadiy Ter-Tadevosyan (General Komandos) was also there. I offered him a ride to Yerevan. During the trip, I asked for his opinion as an army expert about the 2016 war. He believed it wasn't a real war but rather a ""test"" before a big war. 

Serj could have stopped the war in 2016 under the same conditions that I was facing in 2020. 

Serj was offered a better deal, actually. If you compare January 2016 *(no interim)* to August 2016 *(no interim, plus UN Sec Con.)*, he had a better deal in front of him. But it was dragged to the point that Serj declared that the negotiation process was suspended because Azerbaijan's stance was unacceptable for us.

Could I stop the war? Yes, by accepting whatever Serj referred to as ""unacceptable for Armenia"". 

This is a legitimate complaint against me. In hindsight, I should have analyzed the situation and told the public that we needed to make all those concessions. But I wasn't sure at that time that that would be the right decision, because the army at the time was reporting that we would be capable of standing our ground per ""not one inch back"" principle. Had I known, I would have handled it differently. The same about 2016. Serj could have prevented the war. //

##Pashinyan: there won't be any communication route without border checks and customs procedures

**Pashinyan:** under no circumstances will Armenia agree to provide a road to Azerbaijan without customs inspections and customs duty. In Sochi and Brussels, we agreed to build railways. 

Publicly voiced positions are the tip of the iceberg, but there are other reasons and issues behind our positions. Aliyev and I tried to delve deeper into the issue. I saw some opportunities for reaching agreements here as well. But we do not have any agreement on this, I just saw some opportunities after that meeting, we should try to use the opportunities to find a real compromise solution to this issue, which does not cross the red lines I have already mentioned about the [vehicle highway] roads.

The road that Azerbaijan gains to Nakhijevan isn't just for Azerbaijan. We view it as an international cargo route. It has to be appealing to international players so it can bring revenues to Armenia. We need not only North-South but also East-West. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071651.html
https://youtu.be/cSLL1Co4txw


##Pashinyan about the safety of cargo transfers:

If Armenian cargo doesn't travel through Azerbaijan, the Azeri cargo won't travel through Armenia. There won't be transfers without security measures. 

It won't make sense to build a railway and not use it. Why would you make large investments? *[Railway is expected to cost very approximately $1B for Azerbaijan and $200M for Armenia.]*

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071654.html


##Pashinyan about a possible peace agreement with Azerbaijan:

Armenia is interested in signing a peace treaty. OSCE Minsk Group recently proposed a Karabakh negotiation agenda, one of the points of which was the issue of a peaceful and comprehensive settlement. We have never and will never refuse to discuss that.

You cannot open a peaceful era without a peace agreement. We need a comprehensive resolution. The purpose of negotiations is to eventually have a peace agreement.

There is propaganda and constant attempts to create the impression that the Armenian government is against border demarcation and delimitation. Armenia supports a peace agreement and a comprehensive resolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071656.html



##Pashinyan about Azerbaijan's possible membership in EAEU trade bloc:

*[Will Armenia veto?]*

If we see a general normalization of relations, it is a topic that we will take seriously. Our stance will depend on our conversation. If it is a step that will contribute to peaceful era, settlement of Artsakh issue, the possibility of compromises, etc. The EAEU membership topic is in the general context of these issues. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071657.html


##Pashinyan about the results of the first 3+2 platform meeting in Moscow:

It left a positive impression. They discussed technical and organizational issues on how often to meet, what to discuss, etc. The 3+2 corresponds to our position that Armenia wants to participate in regional talks.

If we already hold talks with Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan, and will soon hold talks with Turkey separately, it wouldn't make sense not to talk within 3+2. So far we have an understanding that 3+2 won't be used to discuss topics that are already being discussed as part of other platforms [i.e. OSCE for Karabakh]. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071659.html


##Pashinyan about relations with Turkey & Azerbaijan:

Unreasonable optimism should not be expressed over discussions with Turkey and Azerbaijan, as there is no basis for that optimism, but the parties express a desire to discuss, talk, try to create a basis for optimism. We are ready to pursue that path.

Armenia and Turkey have appointed special envoys. The first meeting has not been scheduled yet, but I hope it will take place soon. There are talks about reopening air and railway communication. Our expectation is the normalization of relations but this is a complex and sensitive problem. The emotions are high in Armenia.

We are ready to normalize relations without preconditions. The recognition of the Armenian Genocide has never been a precondition for normalizing relations and opening borders. Our stance remains the same regarding the issue of international recognition of the Genocide.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071660.html


##Pashinyan about a need to reroute Kirants-Voskepar Tavush road after border demarcation:

*[It's about a section that's similar to the southern Syunik road that was recently replaced with a new road that doesn't cross the border.]* 

We are discussing which maps to use for the border delimitation. We are meticulously examining maps from different years to see where our roads cross the border. We are examining various scenarios.

For example, per the 1975 map, 90% of Berkaber village's arable lands are currently under Azeri control. A very large part of Vazashen village land is under Azeri control since the 1990s. Most of Paravakar's arable lands are also under Azeri control.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071662.html


##Pashinyan believes the Armenia-Azerbaijan enclaves were formed ""illegally""

**Pashinyan:** we have not found a legal basis for the existence of enclaves. In my previous interviews, I spoke about what a ""map"" is. You can draw anything, but it has to have a legal basis. We have already studied all the possible documents in the past year. So far we haven't found a legal basis for them.

*[Pashinyan earlier said they are discussing the possibility of each country keeping the ""enclaves"" that are in its territory.]*

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071663.html


##Pashinyan about returning two Azeri soldiers ""without anything in return"":

Armenia is not ""dealing"" with people. Armenia demonstrated full adherence to international norms by returning two border-crossing Azeris.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071652.html

##Pashinyan and Aliyev will meet on December 28

**Pashinyan:** there will be contact with Aliyev during the December 28 CIS conference in St. Petersbourg. It's not an official two-way meeting, but there will be contact.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071653.html


##Pashinyan about Parliamentary vs Presidential system:

President Armen Sarkissian believes that Armenia should switch to a presidential system, but I believe that Parliamentary is better. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071666.html


##Pashinyan about the politicization of university leadership:

Events in 2020 proved that we did not ""hijack"" universities with our party members. But it turns out that 90% of universities were secretly already politicized. 

During the most difficult times for our state, the universities threw themselves into the arms of the former regime, thinking that our government will soon collapse and they could return to the 2000s.

Today, when MOD Suren Papikyan is the chairman of the YSU council, he is there to ensure the non-partisanship of universities. Many people were given a chance to change but did not use it. We are entering university councils to ensure the principle of non-partisanship.

Diplomats also stabbed us in the back during the crucial time. They gave me written reports around topics, then publicly claimed they were unaware of those topics while holding the opposition's flag during the June elections.

##anti-corruption: former mayor of Armavir is found guilty of voter bribery to help Serj-Vanetsyan alliance in June 20 elections

**Prosecutors report:** PU alliance ballot's #16 candidate was the former Armavir mayor R. Khlghatyan. He reached an agreement with a resident to distribute bribes to over 147 residents to help the PU alliance.

The ex-mayor went to the accomplice's home and gave him ֏9M to be distributed as a bribe. The house was raided by police during the transaction. *[NSO cough Pegasus cough]*

The ex-mayor and his accomplice plead guilty. We decided to downgrade their arrest to bail. 

The court gave a guilty verdict on Thursday. They were sentenced to 4 years, but it was replaced with 5-year probation.

The ֏9M bribe money was confiscated and deposited to state coffers. //

##Diaspora Office chief Sinanyan details the efforts to repatriate Armenian experts, and programs to make diasporans play a more active role:

**database of volunteer experts**

A database was created as part of a program to map the diaspora's potential. It includes the names of those who can contribute to the development of various sectors in Armenia. For years we've wondered what diaspora's true potential is. This program aims to answer that questions.

**iGorts hires diasporans to help the government**

50 experts arrived to volunteer in 2020. Over half of them have repatriated. 14 got a permanent job in state offices, including in management positions. Examples are the director of the National Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, a deputy Economy Minister, organizers of Expo 2020 Dubai, etc. Another diasporan has moved to Artsakh and founded the ""Hub Artsakh"" organization.

Another 50 experts were invited this year. They are currently working in 26 various departments. This year we allowed them to work in more types of offices. They work in Science Committee, Finance Ministry, Constitutional Court, President's office, Artsakh government, etc.

The average age is 33.

**Step Towards Home program**

It launched in June and invited 400 diasporan teenagers from 24 countries. The goal is education and culture. They were enrolled in language, dance, and culture classes. Trips were organized to historical sites. 

**about complaints from diaspora about lack of cooperation**

**Reporter:** some traditional diaspora representatives complain that the cooperation isn't as good after Diaspora Ministry was [converted as an office under executive branch]. They say they need better guidance from the Office on what to do.

**Sinanyan:** we can talk several hours around this topic, but I'll say this: There are such perceptions but it's not like they have ever received any serious guidance from Armenia in the past. Two things are happening:

1) After the war, some of the old traditional diasporan structures took a hostile stance towards Armenia and its government for political reasons. That is a big mistake and it harms our national interests. Some are playing into the hands of Turkish propaganda that's trying to poison Armenia-diaspora relations.   

2) There is a ""monopoly"" status in regard to traditional diasporan structures. For decades they were the only ones cooperating with the government. We have a more open approach. We are open to cooperating with more diasporan structures. We are willing to work absolutely with everyone, including those that have a very critical stance towards Armenia and the government after 2018. 

But they must accept that there won't be ""monopolies"". That ""monopoly"" status hasn't led to anything good. We should be united around the state. That state is in Armenia, and not diaspora. We need to work together for Armenia. 

**expanding Diaspora Office with the appointment of foreign commissioners**

*[It's about recruiting local activists around the world who know how their system works to help with promoting stuff.]* Our office is very small to cooperate with 7 million diaspora, so we need to expand. 

This program is new so we have not yet made appointments, but there are candidates. We are currently in the process of planning how to geographically divide countries to achieve our goal.  

**make the diasporans' voices heard in Armenia**

One option is to have a two-chamber parliament, with one being a Diaspora Consultative Chamber. The options are yet to be discussed in Armenia. We don't need to reinvent the wheel. There are working models around the world. There are various options.

##the goal is to increase the share of processing industry in GDP to 15% by 2026

**Economy Ministry:** we're developing a strategy for the development of 5 priority industrial sectors. They are diamond & jewelry, light & heavy industries, machinery, and pharma. 

There will be subsidy/leasing support programs for each sector. New technologies will be introduced in the heavy industry to increase automation.

💎 🙌 **diamond industry** 💎 🙌

Armenia has always had potential in the diamond field. Up until 2003 we had growth in diamond processing and export. The numbers began to gradually drop due to unfavorable import conditions. [Last week the government decided to form Hay Almast state company](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/rcqlsz/dec92021_expolice_chief_gasparyan_family_charged/) to aid the diamond industry.  

Hay Almast will sign contracts with Russian ""Alrusa"" and ""Gokhran"" companies to import raw materials for Armenian producers. Individual Armenian firms have difficulty signing long-term contracts with Russian firms. I believe we will see rapid growth in the industry after this.

Our goal is to bring the processing industry's GDP share to at least 15% by 2026.  

As for pharma, this year we began producing the Sputnik Lite vaccine. This is one of the first steps towards developing local pharma and exports. //

##Armenia will choose a ""Best Employer of the Year"" starting next year 

A memorandum was signed today between government agencies and worker's unions to launch a new annual initiative to choose the best employer of the year, starting 2022. Top-10 rating list will be created. 

**Inspection agency:** we travel a lot and penalize companies for breaking rules but we want to encourage the good ones, too.

The criteria will be developed in 1H2022. It'll take into account violations, complaints, physical working conditions, retraining programs, safety rules, and positive measures taken by the employer to protect worker rights.

The labor shortage and competition have contributed to a significant change in the mindset of employers. They don't want to exploit their workers. It's better to keep workers healthy and happy to maintain productivity. //

##Russia wishes peace and patience to Armenia and Azerbaijan

##what's the status of the agricultural insurance industry?

*In 2019 the government decided to give subsidies to farmers to help insure their crops.*

**Economy Ministry:** we're ending 2021 with an increased activity compared to 2020. There were more contracts, more types of crops, more insured lands:

2020: 2,300 hectares | 1,546 contracts

2021: 5,830 hectares | 4,300 contracts

The types of crops that are covered by insurance went from 2 to 11. This year the insurance expanded to cover all provinces.

This year the three insurance firms collected ֏475M from farmers and paid ֏320M in compensation. The [loss ratio] was 67%, which is great because we were expecting to reach that level in 2023.

This is still a pilot program. In the near future we plan to expand the types of crops that are covered. //

##COVID stats

6.2k tested. 135 infected. 407 healed. 3 deaths.

##Shirak province stats: vaccination rate is still low, but it's rising

27% is fully vaccinated. 39% have taken at least one dose.

95% of government, medical, and school workers.


##dozens of thousands of unused expired vaccines had to be thrown away 

**Ministry:** Some AstraZeneca and Moderna shots had to be purged. Covid vaccines have a shorter lifespan compared to measles and flu vaccines that can last 1-2 years.

Covid vaccine lifespan has improved from 1 to 9 months since its creation. A lot depends on how fast the vaccine is shipped to the country after it's manufactured.

In April-May, we received AstraZeneca vaccines as a gift but the demand wasn't high enough to use all of them within the 1-month expiration date. 27,000 shots had to be purged. You need to gather 10 people for the vaccine. It should be used within 6 hours of opening the vial. The leftover must be purged.

About as many Moderna shots were purged after the November 28 expiration date.

Moderna is kept at -20C in the main storage. Once you transfer it to clinics, it's kept at +2C to +8C, but you cannot bring it down to -20C again. We had to use it or throw it within 30 days. 

EU has extended Moderna's lifespan by 2 months, to 8. Pfizer and Sputnik have also extended lifespans. They are studying how effective the vaccine's protection will be after six months if the expiration date is extended. 

##not so fast, says Healthcare Ministry after Constitutional Court ruling

The top court ruled yesterday that the Ministry has no authority to require unvaccinated workers to pay for PCR tests out of pocket. 

**Ministry official:** the ruling does not require the state or employer to pay for the PCR test. The unvaccinated workers are still expected to submit PCR results. The part about ""worker pays for PCR"" was struck down, but the employer or other individuals can pay for it. //

In other news, the Parliament recently approved a law to allow employers to fire unvaccinated workers who refuse to present PCR results.

##flu is sending people to hospitals 

There are more emergency calls and hospitalizations relating to acute respiratory infections. It's especially active in Yerevan and the northern provinces. 

Doctors are recording a 2x increase from last year. There is an increase in the <4 and 5-14 age groups.

Influenza A (H3) variant is circulating and has resulted in the hospitalization of dozens of pregnant women in the past 4 weeks.

**Healthcare Ministry**: take your seasonal flu vaccine, limit the contact with individuals who have symptoms, stay home if you're sick, don't treat yourself with antibiotics at home, wear warm clothes, etc.

5/2/2022,Few words about infowar (2020-present),"It seems Azerbaijan as country has lost massive positive soft power on the social media (aka all of it). First of all, in generally, Iranian and Arab on Twitter and Reddit were already pro-Armenia since 2020.
Besides that fuckton of Western journalists that supported Armenia and they are actually genuinelly supported them and it didn't look amateurish. And I am not counting organizations like ANCA and celebraties starting from Serj Tankian and ending with all those pro-Armenian celebs on Hollywood. 

In the other hand we couldn't spread the word, that we are right and literallly NO ONE outside of Turkey and Pakistan helped as in media power

In general, we lost the infowar, now we can't prove that we were liberating those areas, not """"invading it"""". Meanwhile since 2020, Armenians keep pushing their narratives from New York Times to Rossiya 1 about """"we used Sunni Syrian radicals"""" (for defense of Shia-majority country, they are that fucking smart) and about """"invasion"""" and keep rewinding those 4 unfortunate videos. Meanwhile they completely ignore things that happened in Ganja, Barda, Tartar including those poor 4000 souls 

Just Armenians, Arabs, Persians, Russians, Indians trolls weren't enough, now we have to deal with European trolls that were brainwashed from all those propaganda

Also, during the Ottoman period, Armenians were called the most ""loyal nation"". Like Nazi Germany, they did not have a historical background in the genocide they committed against the Jews.

[I want you to pay attention to the acceptance dates when you enter the wikipedia page designed here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide_recognition#States,_regions,_provinces,_municipalities_and_parliamentary_committees)

On the wikipedia page above, the acceptance dates are 90-100-110 years later, which is an important argument. Because what happens when a ""genocide"" is accepted 90-100 years later?

The answer, of course, is political. Currently, at the time of Erdogan's governance  (Erdogan's  governance 2002-present)

Is it political? Yes, now I have a question. Does the parliament decide this is genocide or is it the president?

\-Answer,Historians! As we know, politicians are liars.

Imagine a spyurkahay trying to educate oneself on the topic and not having any Armenian sourced (no azeri propaganda) information about it.  

So, anyone wants to know the only connection Nzdeh had with Hitler (he did have connection to him, therefore, to nazis) is that in 1939 he proved Armenians not to have any jewish roots and instead being “Ariatsis” which saved a lot of Armenians being held at concentration camps. Moreover, he did not show any support to the nazis and even fought against them in WW2 with the help of red army."

##is it true that the U.S. blocked a resolution during the UN Security Council session?

**Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan:** Thankfully the UNSC session was public so we were able to hear the opinions of the U.S. and other members. I think today the world clearly sees Azerbaijan's attempts to carry out ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh. 

You asked if the U.S. was hindering the passage of a resolution. I don't think the U.S. has any plans or wants to contribute to this ethnic cleansing. It would be hard for me to imagine that. 

I believe and I hope that the U.S. understands the magnitude of the worsening humanitarian crisis, and I hope the U.S. understands that a possible resolution would help resolve this situation and bring the parties back to the negotiation table.

##political infighting in Nagorno-Karabakh 

Nagorno-Karabakh's former State Minister (prime minister) Ruben Vardanyan, a Russian-Armenian billionaire who recently moved to Nagorno-Karabakh, is urging President Arayik Harutyunyan to ""keep his promise"" and resign. The President's allies have threatened to retaliate in case steps are taken to force the President's resignation.

**Analyst Suren Surenyants:** Here is what happened. They drafted a consensus scenario, the first step of which was quite illogical. They appointed the leader of the smallest opposition party [ARF] as the head of parliament.  

Then President Harutyunyan changed his mind midway and refused to give the rest of his powers to the parliament leader. He imitated a resignation. 

President Harutyunyan has been a weak leader. He has been under the influence of two factions from the beginning: 1) Ex-president Bako Sahakyan, 2) Pashinyan's man Masis Mayilyan.

Bako Sahakyan and Masis Mayilyan became ""shareholders"" in Harutyunyan's government. He tried to appease all parties by handing out positions.

The biggest problem with Harutyunyan is his lack of vision for the resolution of the crisis. He isn't making any decisions. Only speeches. 

Only Samvel Babayan has proposed a specific plan. I may not agree with all the points, but at least he has a plan. It's about launching a dialogue with Azerbaijan. 

The other politicians, like Ruben Vardanyan, say the right things but don't have a plan for achieving their goals.

Sergey Lavrov recently proposed a [14-point plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/15t4sml/un_security_council_discusses_azerbaijans/) for the integration of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians into Azerbaijan. It is worse than Lavrov's [March 2023](https://massispost.com/2023/03/sergey-lavrov-proposes-donbas-and-kosovo-serbian-local-self-government-models-for-nagorno-karabakh/) statement about creating a Kosovo Serbian self-government model for Armenians. To those who have already torched Lavrov's document: Do we have a better proposal? We do not. 

Lavrov's document doesn't envisage any status for Nagorno-Karabakh as a subject, and no political autonomy. It's about weak municipal-level rights or proportional rights. The mayor of Stepanakert could be Armenian, but there is no guarantee Baku won't arrest him the next day for any reason.

Russia proposed this plan so it could extend its peacekeeping mandate so at least the physical existence of Armenians could be guaranteed. 

All of this assumes that Azerbaijan would agree to it, which is not guaranteed.

**Reporter:** What do various power circles of Nagorno-Karabakh want? President Harutyunyan avoids decision-making at any cost. Ruben Vardanyan, who speaks on behalf of ex-presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh, does he support Lavrov's plan? 

**Surenyants:** They don't even know what they want. I hear a lot of political jargon. If we are going to replace Harutyunyan, then the replacement must at least have a realistic plan and not simply make statements about ""we must resist"".

There are two realistic options:

(1) We settle with guarantees that Armenians will physically exist (without a status).

(2) We develop norms for coexistence with Azeris.

**Reporter:** Samvel Babayan, the biggest opposition figure, has been sidelined, but he has proposed a plan to hold a dialogue with Azerbaijan to discuss coexistence. If the pressure on Harutyunyan increases, could he eventually make a deal with Samvel Babayan?

**Surenyants:** Yes. That would be the last resort for him, and he is quickly approaching that point, by judging from internal developments. 

But it's also possible that Samvel Babayan, Harutyunyan, and others could unite and form a crisis management group that would operate on the basis of consensus. There was a proposal to form one earlier. 

There are three power circles in Nagorno-Karabakh today:

(1) President Harutyunyan and his team.

(2) Ruben Vardanyan, Bako Sahakyan, Arkadiy Ghukasyan (ex-presidents).

(3) Samvel Babayan.

Ideally, they will form a consensus group and draft a specific plan of action that would describe their vision for NK-AZ relations and what NK believes is necessary to guarantee the coexistence with Azerbaijan and the protection of Armenians in NK.

##interview with ranking Armenian government official Andranik Kocharyan 

**REPORTER:** Ruben Vardanyan has accused the Armenian government of abandoning Nagorno-Karabakh.

**ANDRANIK:** Ruben Vardanyan is confusing Nagorno-Karabakh with Tatarstan. We stand with the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

**REPORTER:** Vardanyan is demanding the resignation of President Harutyunyan. In response, Harutyunyan's ruling party released a statement in support of the President, accusing Vardanyan of lacking statesmanship.

**ANDRANIK:** Do you remember the mysterious appearance of Ruben Vardanyan in Nagorno-Karabakh? Now we see his inexplicable behavior. Who is Ruben Vardanyan, and what is he doing in Nagorno-Karabakh? He revealed a shadowy process that our publics were unaware of. What secret dinner did they have and what was discussed during the dinner?

**REPORTER:** There were 8 people...

**ANDRANIK:** I know the names of those 8 people. He is very good at uploading photos and videos about the Armenian world, homeland Nagorno-Karabakh, but his statements about the past, present, and future are so contradictory that the dog doesn't recognize its owner. 

He then reveals himself in the form of Prince Hamlet and announces that 8 people were attempting to force the president to resign. 

**REPORTER:** Why?

**ANDRANIK:** For the power to be transferred to the current president of the parliament [minority ARF]. ARF has only 3 elected members in parliament. What is the point of transferring the power to them? What will that solve? 

Is it possible that their true intention is to manufacture a political crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh so they can transfer the crisis to Armenia? That won't happen. I'm confident that Harutyunyan won't resign. I welcome the statement by the ruling party aimed at Vardanyan.

Vardanyan should focus on collecting the stones from the church's backyard and dream about the Armenian Homeland. This is not the time for մունդռիկություն: These 8 figures should keep calm and contribute to the resolution of the ongoing crisis instead.

**REPORTER:** Are they attempting to give the presidential powers to ARF so it can better rally the Diaspora?

**ANDRANIK:** Why aren't they doing it today? The lao is still asleep. They can't even form unity around the Yerevan municipality elections. That's because people can see through it.

**REPORTER:** Who took part in the mysterious 8-person dinner?

**ANDRANIK:** Representatives of the former governments of Nagorno-Karabakh and former military apparatus members. It was 7+1, with the ""+1"" being Ruben Vardanyan, whose appearance in Nagorno-Karabakh is still a mystery.

**REPORTER:** What was the dinner about?

**ANDRANIK:** To capture power in Armenia. They couldn't do it from within Armenia, so they are trying to use Nagorno-Karabakh as a backdoor. That's why they push the propaganda that the ""Armenian government has abandoned Nagorno-Karabakh"". They are attacking the peace process, suggesting that ""we don't need it"". We do, in fact, need peace, so Armenia can restore its power. But they don't give a shit about restoring our losses. Their goal is to come to power. Life is not life if they don't have a chair.

Nagorno-Karabakh is the most important thing for Armenia today. It is the castle for our statehood. We've done everything possible to create the conditions to allow Armenians to continue to live in Nagorno-Karabakh. The [gang of 8], on the other hand, is busy with disheartening the population by claiming ""war is coming soon"", ""this is the end"". The best way to prevent war is to prepare for it while promoting peace. The opposition is sabotaging our efforts at every step: don't negotiate, don't open borders [with Turkey], don't try this and that. Their goal is to minimize the surface of diplomatic contact. These people still think we live in 1994. What we need is to end the practice of fearmongering the population and instill confidence instead. 

**REPORTER:** Are certain foreign powers [Russia] controlling the group of 8 in Nagorno-Karabakh?

**ANDRANIK:** Yes. Many superpowers have interests in our region. They want certain logistics and roads. They want loyal politicians who were fed with their promises for years. This is a matter of national security. Do you see how many wartime traitors authorities have uncovered so far? What does that tell us?

**REPORTER:** The government has decided to establish a new foreign intelligence agency focused on external threats due to the insufficient performance of other intelligence agencies before the war. How will its quality be any different if the agents continue to train in Russia?

**ANDRANIK:** They will undergo training in Armenia. In certain situations, when they are forced to train abroad, it will be done in a strictly monitored environment.

**REPORTER:** ... in Russia?

**ANDRANIK:** Not necessarily. We just want our agents to have complete loyalty to the Republic of Armenia.

**REPORTER:** Is it safe to fly jets to Kapan airport considering its proximity to Azerbaijan border?

**ANDRANIK:** My Azeri counterpart has made threats toward the airport. Excuse me, but who is he? Why is he telling us not to fly jets within our country? We will expose Azerbaijan's terroristic behavior. There will be consequences if Azerbaijan shoots down a civilian jet.

**REPORTER:** Before the launch of flights to our Kapan airport, Azerbaijan was complaining about Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians jamming Azeri jets. Were they lying to build a ground for provocation?

**ANDRANIK:** Then let's bring international observers to find out what's going on and who is telling the truth. The U.S. co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group was offering observers before the 2020 war. He wanted to use drones and other tech to monitor the NK-AZ borders. We could proceed with that plan today if Azerbaijan is concerned about ""shots"" fired by Armenians.

##why Armenia and Ukraine need Su-30SM and F-16 jets: interview with military expert Artsrun Hovhannisyan 

**ARTSUN:** We should have acquired them sooner. Let's revisit this topic now that Ukraine is going to receive F-16 jets. Why is F-16 still so important if Ukraine has already received numerous modern weapons?

In modern warfare, unless you want to sit in the same place and take a beating, you must have air superiority. For that, you must have jets. It's amateur talk that you can replace jets with drones or air-defense batteries.

The jet will help you clear and monitor the air, and carry out strikes from the air.

Let's study the Ukraine example. Ukraine has already received winged (cruise) missiles like StormShadow that are launched from a jet. They will soon receive the German Taurus. 

These missiles are long-range, but Ukraine's weakness is its aircraft fleet which cannot take full advantage of them. [Su-24 can carry those cruise missiles](https://www.eurasiantimes.com/its-official-ukrainian-su-24-fencer-fighter-jets-are-launchin/). 

2-4 units of Su-24 can take off simultaneously, receive protection from F-16 or something else, and safely climb high enough and get close enough for their missiles to be maximally successful.  

Instead, Ukraine is currently launching Su-24 jets one by one from secret airfields. They fly close to the ground in order to go undetected by the Russian airforce. Eventually, they climb <500 meters and fire 1-2 cruise missiles. This is only enough for the missiles to travel half of their intended range, around 150 km. If the Su-24 could climb >4 km, the missiles would fly 300 km.

To make this strategy work, before Su-24's main missile strike, Ukraine is attempting to synchronize a pre-strike by launching decoy missiles or drones to smother Russia's air defenses. The U.S. army does this ""preparatory work"" for 6-9 hours before the main strike.

Now, what would happen if Ukraine had F-16s? F-16 would take care of Russian Su-30 and Su-35, which is another topic of discussion. This would give the Su-24 fleet a narrow window of opportunity to climb a few kilometers. Ukraine would still need to fire decoy missiles, like the MALD that they used recently. After firing 40 decoy missiles and overwhelming Russia's air defense, 4-10 units of Su-24 could climb and fire 10-20 StormShadow missiles, which would then travel long enough and would have the maximum effectiveness.

Second example. Ukraine complains about Russia's Ka-52 helicopters. Russia is proud of their performance. Why? It's a similar situation that Armenia faced during the 2020 war, in which our main problem wasn't the Bayraktar drone, but rather Azeri Mi-8 helicopters equipped with Israeli SPIKE NLOS missiles that targeted our air defense batteries, vehicles, artillery, and tanks. Russia is attempting the same with its Ka-52 helicopters. 

The Russian helicopter climbs only 400-1000 meters to evade Ukraine's air defense with a 30-40 km range. They launch missiles with a 10-12 km range. 

Ukrainian battalions and even brigades on the frontline do not possess expensive air defense batteries with a 30 km range because they would be destroyed by Russian artillery. Therefore, Ukraine lacks the means to take down those Russian helicopters. Frontline troops do have smaller and cheaper things like MANPADs, OSA, and Strela-10, but these are not powerful enough to reach the Russian helicopters.

What is the solution? My friends. The king of air superiority is the jet. Your jet can remain deep within your territory and destroy the enemy helicopter even if the latter is only at a 500m altitude. The jet is the only practical solution.

This is why Armenia needed/needs the Su-30 jets. That's how you destroy those Azeri Mi-8 helicopters carrying SPIKE NLOS. There is simply no other solution in this situation. Armenia must have a strong aviation doctrine.

Ukraine's counteroffensive is slow partially due to a lack of [F-16] jets. What could the F-16 do against the revered Russian Su-35S w/Irbis radio, Su-30SM, and MiG-31? When you pit them 1v1, the Su-35S could outperform the likely-outdated version of the F-16 that Ukraine will receive. But the reality is that the Western airforce is applied with a specific doctrine that couples the use of jets with strong intel, radio, and other pieces of information that are passed to Ukraine remotely by its allies.

For example, if the Netherlands ends up sending the older generation of F-16 jets, which are also possessed by Turkey, with only 70-90 km AMRAAM millies, Ukraine's Western allies could still use their own air control system AWACS and other methods of intel to detect targets far away and feed the info to F-16. 

This is something that Russia lacks. Russia doesn't have a developed satellite and AWAC system integrated with its airforce. Besides that, the missiles that give the Russian airforce a long reach, are very very few in number. 

Armenia did receive some missiles for its Su-30SM jets, and we were supposed to import those long-range R-77 and XA-59 missiles from Russia next, but as you can see from the Ukraine war, Russia can't even produce them for its own army in significant quantities.

When Armenia purchased the Su-30SM, these missiles were still undergoing tests in Russia. Russia told us they weren't ready for use. *""We will give them to you when they are ready.""*

Read the Russian defense ministry report and see how many Xa-59 missiles are used weekly. Very few. Armenia was expecting to import those missiles. That's a little background for you.

If Ukraine imports 3-5 squadrons of F-16 connected to NATO's extremely-developed radio/intel apparatus... The U.S. has the world's most developed system. For every 1 combat aircraft, they have 1 piece of equipment or a jet that provides intel and radio warfare support to the combat aircraft. No other country has that ratio. In Russia, every 1,000 combat aircraft has 50 pieces of supportive equipment/jets. NATO can help Ukraine in this department, just as they help HIMARSes to strike their targets.

Up next: We'll discuss the importance of air doctrine for Armenia.

2/16/2021,Renaming Turkey to Anatolia,"First of all, it has to do with PanTurkism. As a kazakh, I cannot stand the Turkish people calling me a Kazakh Turk or Kazakhstani Turk, thus denying my strong and only Kazakh ethnic identity, and giving me a Turkic one, which I don't have at all. Many Panturkist culturally appropriate(learning languages, buying clothes, trying to throat sing as if it relates to them anyway etc.) and seek some sort of intermarriage/intermixing and building a union in some way. I feel this as a threat to my and other relatively small  more autentic Central Asian and Siberian ethnicities for they have no media resources to fight back this dangerous PanTurkist propaganda and usually are brainwashed.


Second, I don't feel Turkish people as relatives at all. I mean you are different race to start with. The only thing we slightly share is a stucture of grammar. This is crazy. By that logic, we could think of english french speaking ethnicities in Africa and relate them to Romanians, because they do speak one language family(Romanic). There is no doubt that genetically Turkish people are predominantly of native origin, intermixed with local Armenian, Kurdish, Greek and Arabic groups. For original Seljuk phenotype press  https://maximus101.livejournal.com/128439.html. Those statues are nothing like modern Turkish people. As a kazakh, we totally reject the cultural Turkicness, which is a last saviour of Turkish PanTurkists, in which anybody, uncluding millions of Syrians, can become one and claim some brotherhood. 


Third, I believe Anatolia is more inclusive and ethnically neuteal term that welcomes the Kurdish minority.  The geographical identity instead of flawed ethnic could also normalize the international relations with neighboring states like Armenia and Greece.

Please, share your thoughts.

P.S. I love Turkey, peopel and your food. Like my favourite one. However, I believe PanTurkism must be fought since it endangers other cultural identities."

Armenia violates ceasefire with Azerbaijan 28 times

https://menafn.com/1100606098/Armenia-violates-ceasefire-with-Azerbaijan-28-times

What exactly does this mean? I see these claimed “violations” almost daily. Again, I understand this is propaganda but are the Azeris claiming Armenia is shooting at their positions? I’ve only ever heard of Armenians being hurt or killed while at the line of contact. Is the border as active in violations as they make it out to be? Is this simply for domestic consumption to stir up nationalism?

It seems intentionally vague but maybe you all can clarify."

12/30/2021,Aliyev Controls Azerbaijan's Media via WhatsApp,"Interesting article about how Aliyev's office sends out WhatsApp messages pretty much daily, to every news outlet, telling them what to write about and how to write it.

Some highlights:

* “Based on President Ilham Aliyev's speech on Iran, it is requested to **expand the campaign on Iran-Armenia relations, drug trafficking, and looting** of the occupied territories \[in and around Nagorno-Karabakh\] by these two countries,” -- the whole drug trafficking story was made up
* The news agency APA published a [lengthy piece](https://apa.az/az/xeber/siyasi/mdb-kursusunden-seslenen-heqiqetler-iran-ve-ermenistan-nece-ifsa-olunur-tehlil-666097) detailing Iranian companies’ involvement in Armenia’s long occupation of Azerbaijani territory. The Trend News Agency [followed up with](https://az.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3499364.html) an interview with member of parliament Javid Gasimov in which he alleged that **Iran had been sowing “drug plantations” for 30 years on Armenian-occupied Azerbaijani territory.**
* On September 20, a week before the one-year anniversary of the start of the war with Armenia, “we ask you to produce materials and start public discussions with a tempo increasing every day,” the message read. “The keywords are ‘Victorious Azerbaijani people’ and ‘Triumphant Supreme Commander-in-Chief.’” “From November 1 to November 7, **the policy is to significantly reduce the sad content (crying and so on)** and to reorient toward Victory Day.”
* On August 26, media were requested to exhaustively cover the birthday of first lady and first vice president Mehriban Aliyeva, “**but without the effect being artificial**,” it clarified. 
* When Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was visiting Azerbaijan with Aliyev, he made a joke about the fact that Jahangir Asgarov, the president of Azerbaijan’s flagship airline AZAL who was accompanying the two leaders, did not have a moustache. The exchange was [captured on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBNKdcH_BNw&feature=youtu.be) but shortly after, media got a message: “**Please do not broadcast the mustache joke** \[…\] that part of the video can be presented on social media by making that section inaudible.”

Especially now with the way they've cracked down on independent media (ie. prohibited it), it's going to be interesting to really see how much the media will control the nation via Aliyev's propaganda.

As much as you might think you're above propaganda, that you can see through it... that's not how brainwashing science works. For decades, advertising companies have known more about human psychology and understood you personally better than you can understand yourself. 

Now, top branding, PR, and psychological manipulation companies are working together with the Aliyev regime to make sure everyone falls in line.

Remember the South Park episode with the 9/11 - Easter Bunny conspiracy? If not, watch it, because that's essentially how Aliyev is making sure everyone has a message to believe -- coming directly from him. Own the truth, own the conspiracy, own everything."

11/5/2022,HDP's Paylan: Turkey is the key country to ensure the peace of two brotherly peoples in the South Caucasus,"Hate speech, nationalist discourse is very easy; But it is very difficult to establish peace and end prejudices.

https://preview.redd.it/x5kwnn85d5y91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=62d3f14e5f9a04081bb96ca671e13401b1b97996

HDP Diyarbakır Deputy Garo Paylan, after the meetings he held in Armenia within the scope of the World Armenians Summit, said: ""Armenian President Vahagn Khaçaturyan, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Armenian Parliament Speaker Alen Simonya and the representative of the Turkey-Armenia normalization process and Armenian Parliament Deputy Speaker Rubinyan and many deputies. ""In all these contacts, we discussed the normalization process of Turkey-Armenia and the lasting peace we dreamed of in the Caucasus,"" he said. Referring to the peace and normalization process, Paylan said, ""We should not internationalize this issue so much. There is a key for this too. There is a key for reconciling two brotherly peoples. The key actor is Turkey. The key country that will ensure peace in the South Caucasus is Turkey. Other countries ""While Turkey can protect its own interests through conflict, Turkey can only gain through peace. This gain will not only belong to Turkey, but also to Azerbaijan and Armenia,"" he said.

HDP Diyarbakır Deputy Garo Paylan, at the press conference he held in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey; He made statements about his visit to Armenia and his contacts there. Paylan emphasized that permanent peace should be established in the Caucasus.

&#x200B;

""Hate speeches and nationalist discourses are very easy, but it is very difficult to establish peace and end prejudices""

Stating that prejudices are created in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia, Paylan said, ""We also face risks. Hate speech and nationalist discourses are very easy. It is very easy to pursue nationalist policies. It is very easy to steal war drums for war policies. Hate speech is enough for them. But establishing peace is very easy. ""It is very difficult to end prejudices and prejudices. It is very difficult to reconcile peoples who have killed each other for a long time. This requires courage, determination and will. I aspire to this struggle,"" he said.

&#x200B;

The highlights of Paylan's statements are as follows:

&#x200B;

The gate of Armenia has also been closed for 30 years.

""I was in Armenia within the framework of a 5-day program on the occasion of the World Armenians Summit. I had many contacts in Armenia, but first of all, what I want to say is that I met with great interest from the Armenian people, public opinion and press. I am proud as a parliamentarian. You do not know from Armenia, but let me tell you, Turkey is being followed very closely. The two peoples have been experiencing problems for a long time. The door of Armenia has been closed for 30 years. The people of Armenia are waiting for this door, which has been closed for 30 years, to be opened and relations to normalize.

&#x200B;

We discussed the Turkey-Armenia normalization process and the lasting peace we dreamed of in the Caucasus.

In this context, I had contacts with Armenian President Vahagn Khachaturyan, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Armenian Parliament Speaker Alen Simonya and the representative of the Turkey-Armenia normalization process and Deputy Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Rubinyan, as well as many deputies and ministers. In all these contacts, we discussed the Turkey-Armenia normalization process and the lasting peace we dreamed of in the Caucasus. We've had conversations about it.

Window of opportunity opens for peace and if these windows of opportunity are not used well, then this window of opportunity closes.

I can say the following about the contacts we made and the situation I saw in the Caucasus; We are at a critical stage. The windows of opportunity for peace are opened and if these windows of opportunity are not used well, then this window of opportunity is closed. I think there is a serious window of opportunity for peace in the Caucasus. But we also face risks. Hate speeches and nationalist discourses are very easy. It is very easy to maintain nationalist policies. It is very easy to sound war drums on war politics. Hate speech is enough for them. But it is very difficult to establish peace and end prejudices. It is very difficult to reconcile peoples who have been killing each other for a long time. This requires courage, determination and willpower. I am up for this fight. I want all politicians of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia to aspire as well. Now we have an opportunity, a chance for peace. We must take advantage of this chance.

&#x200B;

""People are filled with prejudices against each other""

There are also prejudices on the sides of Armenia, Turkey and Azerbaijan. All these prejudices are understandable prejudices. Why? Because for decades, peoples have been filled with prejudices against each other. True or false propaganda, hate speech and prejudices against each other have been magnified. Now we need to show a will on the path of peace to end these prejudices.

&#x200B;

""Unfortunately, the Armenian side made mistakes about achieving peace within maximalist expectations""

After the first war in the 1990s, the Armenian side unfortunately made mistakes about achieving peace within maximalist expectations. Because their expectations are maximalist. There is no chance to reach a just peace within maximalist expectations. Because if a people says that only peace be for me, let it be whatever I say, there can be no talk of peace there. For lasting peace; We could only achieve lasting peace with a peace that demands justice for both the conflicting parties. Unfortunately, we missed this window of opportunity in the 1990s in this sense. We made mistakes.

&#x200B;

""Azerbaijani and Armenians lived together""

After the second war, I see that Azerbaijan made the same mistake. The Azerbaijani side has maximalist expectations just like the Armenians did in the 1990s. He always says to get what I want, he says everything should be on my side. Unfortunately, there is no chance of reaching a just peace again in such expectations. There is no chance of achieving a lasting peace. A lasting peace can only be achieved if the Azeri and Armenian peoples reach a just and lasting peace. Justice must be the signature of this peace. Only 35 years ago, Azeris and Armenians lived together in Susha, Karabakh and Baku. But within the framework of nationalist races, they broke away from each other, they slaughtered each other. Now is the time to remind you of this will to live together. When we remember this, we will reach lasting peace much faster.

&#x200B;

""Geography is destiny, neither Turkey, Armenia nor Azerbaijan will change their neighbors""

Geography is destiny. Neither Turkey, Armenia nor Azerbaijan will be able to change their neighbors. Since geography is our destiny, since we have to live together as neighbors, we must find ways to live in peace permanently. This can only be achieved through a just peace.

&#x200B;

I talked about the window of opportunity in the 1990s. I met with the then President Levon Terpotrosyan. We had a very sincere conversation with Terpotrosyan, which lasted for a long time. I can happily say that Mr. Terpotrosyan also conveyed to me that he is ready to take any responsibility for the peace that is possible now. Unfortunately, we missed that window of opportunity in the 1990s. But now it is important that the actors of that period put the will to take responsibility again.

&#x200B;

In 2008 there was a new window of opportunity with football diplomacy underway so-called protocols. At that time, the President was Ser Sargsyan. I also interviewed Sargsyan. I urged him to take responsibility as well. Now is the time to take responsibility together in this sense. Mr. Nikol Pashinyan has this will for peace. Barış is calling to sit at the table. In this regard, the will for peace in Armenia is quite appropriate. But there is also an opposition in Armenia who does not believe in this. Now is the time to hold this extended hand. It is time to hold both Azerbaijan and Turkey. This is an important window of opportunity. Pashinyan extends his hand for peace. We must achieve a just peace.

&#x200B;

""You cannot solve your problems if your borders are closed""

There are statements that the border will open. There is a problem between two peoples, you cannot solve your problems if your borders are closed. Think of it as two neighboring households, you have problems, you cannot solve problems if your doors are closed. You can solve problems if you open the door. How do we end these prejudices? We will open the border, increase relations, initiate cultural, diplomatic and economic relations. As a result of these relations, we will end the prejudices. Both peoples will win.

&#x200B;

Opening this border is of course beneficial for Armenia. It will be beneficial for the eastern provinces of Turkey as well as for the people of Armenia. This is my call to mayors, governors, all administrators and deputies in the eastern provinces of Turkey. Come out and explain about it. Put pressure on the government. Make calls that the opening of this border will change the fate of Kars, Iğdır, Ardahan, Van, Diyarbakır and even Trabzon and Rize via the ports. Why is Ağrı so poor, why is Kars and Iğdır so poor? Because the border with Armenia right next to it is closed. If this border is opened, all the peoples of the region will win together. We lost together in wars, together we can win with peace. In Armenia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, the people also win.

&#x200B;

""There are big players in the region Iran and Russia""

We have a risk. I saw this in my contacts in Armenia. Unfortunately, we are on the way to this solution in a conflictual process, but we are also faced with the problem of internationalizing the solution. There are big players in the region. Iran, Russia. Pelosi, President of the US Congress, went there after the recent clashes. Lastly, Mr. Pashinyan and Mr. Aliyev called Putin and held talks in Sochi. The Caucasus has returned to the playing field of the great powers. Great powers have power struggles. If such great powers make calls to the parties in this region within the framework of their own interests, the solution of this problem will be difficult.

""The key country that will ensure peace in the South Caucasus is Turkey""

We should not internationalize this issue so much. There is a key for that too. There is a key to the reconciliation of the two brotherly peoples. The key actor is Turkey. The key country that will ensure peace in the South Caucasus is Turkey. While other countries can protect their own interests through conflict, Turkey can only gain through peace. This gain will not only belong to Turkey, but also to Azerbaijan and Armenia. In this regard, I call on all actors in Turkey, the government and the President; Let's reconcile these two quarrelsome brothers and sisters. Let's reconcile the two countries. Let's take responsibility for this together. It's time to win together. I am ready to take all responsibility for the permanent peace in the Caucasus, the Azerbaijan-Armenia peace and the Turkey-Armenia normalization process. I'll take it from now on.""

""Those who do not want a solution are those who maintain their hegemony in the region through the deadlock""

Paylan said, ""It is clear that those who do not want a solution in the South Caucasus. Those who do not want a solution are those who maintain their hegemony in the region through the absence of a solution. This is Russia to a large extent. Because it can maintain its hegemony in the region on the back of a deadlock. We, on the other hand, can move on to a period that will bring all the peoples together with peace. ""If the deadlock brings benefits to other powers and the solution brings benefits to us, the Armenian and Azerbaijani peoples, now we must take more responsibility so that we can open this locked process. In this sense, the key country is Turkey. We should take more responsibility in this sense,"" he said.

Expressing that the opposition in Armenia does not believe in peace, Paylan, when asked about the reason for this, said, ""Sarkissian is a former President and one of the opposition leaders. The opposition is expressing the prejudices prevailing in Armenia on this issue. Currently, the maximalist demands of Azerbaijan and Turkey's opposition to this issue. Prejudices about him being shy about taking a step are unfortunately strong in the Armenian public... There is no opposition to this process in Turkey. All political parties support the normalization process. Turkey is very comfortable in taking a step. Because everyone in the South Caucasus, all political parties want peace. But Armenia ""There is an opposition in Turkey, there are prejudices about it. There is a thought that this process will fail. The way to regress this thought is not words but action. Now is the time to act,""

9/10/2023,Armenians shouldn't react in a bipolar or emotional manner,"Firstly, not all Armenians, but enough on here that I notice a pattern.

I'll give you an example. 

Mildly positive development in relations with country X, or country X says/does something perceived as positive:

""Uoougghh country X is so good.""

Mildly not positive development in relations with country X, or country X says/does something not perceived as positive: 

U-turn: ""Uoougghh how could country X do this to us. I no longer think they are good."" 

International relations are based on interests. What can I do for you? What have I done for you? What sort of relation have I built with you? How long have we been at this? What direction are we going in? In what ways do we align? In what ways do we differ? Who are my friends/enemies? Who are your friends/enemies? What's the opportunity cost of maintaining this relation? Etc. 

If something doesn't go our way, that's a refelction of our diplomacy with regards to that country. It's not the end of the world. Instead of crossing your arms and being upset about it, which will not amount to anything, consider what we could/should have done, and how we can work towards changing things in a constructive manner.

After all, consider the morons that previously governed Armenia who did not attempt to make any diplomatic forays with any countries for almost 30 years. I'm surprised our overall relations are as good as they are right now when you put everything into context. We've improved a lot in the past few years, which means nothing is set in stone, and there's still a lot of untapped potential in this regard.

**On the topic of Russia:**

There is a substantive and tangible effort by Russia, Russian affiliates, and Russian sympathizers to amplify any perceived negative developments with regards to Ukraine, the West, the EU (etc.) while also smothering and casting doubt on any positive developments with said bloc. It is in their every interest to do this. 

Russian propaganda, rumors, and fake news are pervasive in the Armenosphere (if I can call it that). Beware, beware, beware. There is no future in this spiteful ghost, it is not where our destiny lie. 

Things can and do change. It's up to us to achieve it."

##by supporting Azerbaijan, we support the Russian aggression: Ukrainian blogger goes viral

Famous Ukrainian singers Max Barskih and Tina Karol recently boycotted Azerbaijan after the military aggression against Armenia. Many Ukrainian social media users supported the decision, while others did not. 

**Ukrainian blogger:** Now I'll talk about human stupidity. To be more precise, the stupidity of Ukrainians who support Azerbaijan's actions in Armenia. Do you know why you are stupid? Because doing so you are supporting Russia's actions against Ukraine. 

Azerbaijan is an aggressor who attacked Armenia under the pretense of ""taking its lands"", just like Russia. Do you support this? Or do you believe aggression is okay against anyone other than Ukraine? 

Jermuk and Nagorno Karabakh are Armenian lands and have never been part of Azerbaijan. You only need to study history and geography to understand this. // 

The blogger's video gained 500,000 views in 3 days. 

Singer Yelena Usenko also wrote a pro-Armenia Instagram post and urged the world not to ignore the events. She also shared a post by VOGUE photographer David Mushegain, who called the world to provide assistance to Armenia similar to the one provided to Ukraine.

##Armenia is an important front in the battle between democracy and autocracy: Speaker Nancy Pelosi 

**Pelosi:** Our delegation traveled to Armenia, an important front in the battle between democracy and autocracy. We conveyed a strong message of support for Armenia’s democracy and security, particularly following Azerbaijan’s offensive against Armenia. Our visit was planned before the hostilities.

##Congress is committed to ensuring that the truth of the Armenian genocide is never erased: Nancy Pelosi 

**Pelosi:** In 2019 we passed legislation to formally acknowledge the Armenian Genocide, which President Biden echoed with his official recognition last year. 

It was a privilege to be awarded the Ambassador Henry Morgenthau medal from the Genocide Museum-Institute, which I accepted on behalf of Congress for our work to recognize and raise awareness on the Armenian Genocide. 

##Nancy Pelosi about meeting Armenian government and civil society groups   

**Pelosi:** Our delegation was honored to meet with Prime Minister Pashinyan and other high-level government leaders, including Speaker Simonyan and Defense Minister Papikyan. 

These engagements provided for an exchange of ideas on policies and actions to advance stability, peace, and prosperity in Armenia and the region.

Our delegation then held a roundtable with civil society leaders, who expressed the concerns and needs of their people during this difficult time and shed their light on Armenia’s battle for democracy and security.  

It was my honor to address those leaders in a speech at the Cafesjian Center for the Arts, a crown jewel of Armenian culture, where I delivered a clear message of America’s commitment to Armenia.

Later, we met with opposition leaders serving in the Parliament. While there are disagreements about domestic policy, there was clear agreement among these leaders that Azerbaijan must immediately stop its aggression.

##our delegation returns to Washington ready to advance commitment to a secure Caucasus: Nancy Pelosi 

**Pelosi:** Further informed and inspired by the reception that we received, our delegation returns to Washington proud and ready to advance the Congress’s longstanding commitment to a democratic Armenia and a secure, peaceful Caucasus region.

Legislative bodies of several U.S. states have officially recognized the independence of Nagorno Karabakh (Republic of Artsakh). The Foreign Minister of Nagorno Karabakh regularly pays diplomatic visits to the U.S. to meet American politicians. One such meeting was [organized this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/xiseqx/sep192022_azeri_opposition_rebukes_proputin/) by the U.S. Congressional Armenian Caucus and ANCA.

**Foreign Minister Babayan:** Nagorno Karabakh will never be part of Azerbaijan. There is an existential, genocidal threat facing our people. We need to unite to support our burgeoning democracy. I'd like to thank you all for supporting Artsakh.

Will the Spanish Government take any measures against this crime on the international level, or will it continue to be in the role of an onlooker? //

The preliminary assessment puts the damages at $50,000 but it could increase by $200,000 once we clear the upper area from unexploded mines and find that the rope was damaged. We will renovate and resume its operations as soon as possible. //

##latest developments in the Russia-Turkey alliance 

>NATO member Ankara opposes Western sanctions on Russia on principal and has close ties with both Moscow and Kyiv

>Western nations are growing concerned over increased economic ties between Turkey and Russia

▶︎ **Part 1: Bank transactions.**

The U.S. recently threatened to sanction Turkish banks if they continue to aid the sanctioned Russian banks. Under pressure, two Turkish banks have agreed to suspend transactions with Russian 'Mir' cards. Some Russian tourists have found themselves unable to make hotel payments.

▶︎ **Part 2: Turkish Airlines won't train Russian pilots anymore.**

The European EASA aviation agency has imposed sanctions against Russia. Turkish Airlines won't be able to train Russian pilots at their flight terminals anymore.

Airlines in other countries are expected to follow suit.

Experts believe this is a heavy blow to Russia's aviation and will lead to a serious deterioration of safety of the long-range flights, which often utilize jets such as Boeing B777 and Airbus A350.


▶︎ **Part 3: Putin's war in Ukraine.**

Putin wants to end the war as soon as possible, believes Erdogan after meeting him during the recent Shanghai Forum. 

**Erdogan:** The situation for Russia is quite problematic. Putin showed me that he is willing to end this ASAP. He should not be allowed to keep the territories the Russian army gained since the beginning of the war. 

**Putin disagrees:** Everything is going according to plan in Ukraine. The objective is Donbas. Our forces are advancing there. Our weapons are showing great effectiveness.

▶︎ **Part 4: Russia wants Turkey to leave NATO.**

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) members are China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. 

Turkey has been a ""partner"". If they apply to formally join, we will examine their application to see if they meet the criteria, said Russia. 

The criteria include being located in Eurasia; having active diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations with SCO members; not having a conflict with an SCO member and not being part of another conflict; not being under a UNSC sanction; not taking part of an alliance hostile to SCO members. 

The latter seems to be problematic. The Russian diplomat emphasized that Turkey is a NATO member, which is considered a hostile organization against SCO member Russia. 

▶︎ **Part 5: Russia will launch regular flights to Turkish-occupied Cyprus.**

There will be direct flights between Russia and Northern Cyprus, according to CNN sources. The negotiations continue. Turkey views this as a diplomatic victory.

##opposition co-leader Arthur Vanetsyan's cousin has acquired the assets of a Russia-based company abandoned by a Western firm 

The world-famous ""Bunge"" agricultural business has several cooking oil brands in Russia, such as ""Maslenitsa"", ""Ideal"", Semyonova"", ""Golden drop"", etc. 

In 2020 they accounted for 10% of Russia's cooking oil market. Their Voronezh plant produces 200 million bottles per year.  

Bunge has sold its Russian shares to former NSS spook Arthur Vanetsyan's cousin Karen. The latter owns another agricultural company called ""Exoil Group"", based in Ukraine. 

What's interesting is that one of the co-owners of Exoil Group is Mikhail Zurabov, who owns 12.5% of the Zangezur Copper Plant.

##Pashinyan held a regular meeting with non-parliamentary opposition parties 

**Aram Sargsyan, Republic Party:** The party leaders were briefed on various topics and developments, as usual. We had asked the Premier to move the schedule forward and hold this meeting today, and he agreed.  

We discussed the UN Security Council session and Nancy Pelosi's visit. The U.S.'s recent engagement is helping stabilize our region. The opposition figures who claim Pelosi's visit will provoke a new military clash are simply circulating Kremlin's primitive propaganda. 

I advised Pashinyan to leave CSTO. The government is calculating its advantages and disadvantages. The government is aware of the public view after CSTO's and Russia's stance after the aggression.

When Azerbaijan invites foreign ambassadors to the occupied Shushi, the ambassadors of Russia and CSTO members have no problem visiting it, but when we invite them to Jermuk, everyone goes except for them. *[Context: Russia's ambassador was hosting the CSTO delegation in Yerevan on the day when the meeting was held in Jermuk.]*

**Reporter:** Critics say that if Armenia leaves CSTO, there will be no alternative alliances. 

**Sargsyan:** There are many countries, like Jordan, that aren't a member of any military alliance. Jordan receives $800m in military aid every year. According to our calculations, Armenia could receive as much as $400m in military aid from the U.S. 

Moreover, the U.S. State Department and French Foreign Ministry have announced readiness to provide military assistance to Armenia, but are unable to do so today because Armenia is a member of CSTO. 

Our membership in CSTO is hindering our ability to acquire modern weapons. We will always lose the war against Azerbaijan if we fight with Russian weapons. 

I've spoken with soldiers in Goris direction. They reassured me that all they need are decent weapons. If it wasn't for Azerbaijan's drones, our soldiers could have been in Azerbaijan proper by now. 

**Reporter:** Pashinyan recently spoke about the challenges with importing weapons, while a ruling party MP claimed that [Russia has not exported](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/xiseqx/sep192022_azeri_opposition_rebukes_proputin/) heavy weapons to Armenia since the 2020 war. Do you have details?

**Sargsyan:** No, because that's a state secret and Pashinyan does not share classified information during the meetings with non-parliamentary parties. 

**Reporter:** Has the U.S. sent signals that they are willing to assist Armenia?  

**Sargsyan:** Speaker Pelosi literally offered her hand yesterday and said they are ready to assist Armenia with all the issues, including security and territorial integrity. Pelosi visited Armenia only because of the democratic reforms in Armenia. She would not have visited otherwise, and we would remain in the swamp and lose more.

##CSTO is taking measures to reduce escalation between Armenia and Russia: Vladimir Putin

CSTO Secretary Stanislav Zas is in Armenia to analyze the situation and meet Armenia's leadership.

**Putin:** Both Azerbaijan and Armenia are close to us, so any escalation is a serious concern for us. They should follow the previously adopted trilateral statements. Measures are being taken through CSTO. A special mission has been sent to the conflict zone to prepare proposals. 

The key to solving the conflict is the professional, joint work within the Armenian-Azerbaijani border delimitation commission, with consulting support from Russia. //

Unlike the governments of other major powers, Kremlin has repeatedly refused to acknowledge the violation of Armenia's territorial integrity, portraying the aggression as a border dispute.

**Putin:** By using this chance, I would like to congratulate the fraternal Armenian people and the country’s leadership on the Independence Day that will be celebrated tomorrow.

Armenia is our closest friend and strategic ally. Russia and Armenia are in intense political dialogue. This year alone we met with Nikol Pashinyan three times. //

##several pro-Russian public figures in Armenia rushed to defend the Armenia-Russia formal alliance

BHK party leader and wealthy businessman Gagik Tsarukyan, and the Russian-Armenian billionaire Samvel Karapetyan (Tashir) have called the idea of leaving CSTO an ""adventurism"". It was in response to the recent street protests in Yerevan during which the pro-Western figures urged the Armenian authorities to rethink the formal alliance agreement with Russia. The businessmen urged the critics to moderate their ""anti-Russian"" rhetoric. 

**Pashinyan's Deputy Chief of Staff:** Armenia's sovereignty and territorial integrity are not subject to negotiation, regardless of whether it's against these concerned businessmen's business interests or not. 

Violation of territorial integrity and sovereignty is the red line that must be unacceptable for anyone who cares about Armenia's present and future. It would have been better for these businessmen to express concern about Azerbaijan's aggression instead. 

These figures are receiving instructions from specific centers to make these statements, under the threat of losing their wealth. // 

**Aghajanyan, ranking ruling party MP:** There is no process to withdraw from CSTO at this time, because doing so would not have any practical effect. On the contrary, such a step may cause risks that Armenia does not need at the moment. But it is a fact that the last three unprovoked attacks by Azerbaijan have not received any assessment by CSTO. The organization is either dysfunctional or has functionality problems.

##update: Russian state media's talk-show host apologizes for the ""stupid error"" after confusing the Nagorno Karabakh conflict with the aggression against Armenia proper 

[Yesterday we learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/xiseqx/sep192022_azeri_opposition_rebukes_proputin/) that Anatoly Kuzichev, the host of the popular ""Time Will Tell"" debate-show, claimed that the conflict happened on Nagorno Karabakh border and that it wasn't clear who started it. This contradicted Russia's official stance because even Vladimir Putin had publicly accepted that the incident was away from Nagorno Karabakh, on the Armenia border.

The following day Kuzichev issued an apology on air.

**Kuzichev:** I said something stupid yesterday. I made a mistake and did not correct it. Some of our guests here corrected me afterward, but it wasn't very accented. And since our program is known for the fact that we are responsible for our words, let that be the case this time as well.

The incident unfolded in the border regions of Armenia, and not the unrecognized Nagorno Karabakh, also known as Artsakh. We are talking about Armenia proper. Please accept my apologies for the stupid mistake. *[ends the statement with a ""thank you"" in Armenian]*

##if the roads are unblocked between Armenia and Azerbaijan, it could bring $4.5-$5 billion in Russian capital to the Armenian market: Deputy Premier of Russia 

Russia wants Armenia and Azerbaijan to unblock the trade links in the region. Deputy Premier of Russia, Alexei Overchuk, has announced that the roads and railways through which the cargo will move will remain the sovereign territory of the host country, a stance supported by Armenia but evidently not Azerbaijan. Critics, however, believe that Russia secretly sides with Azerbaijan on this issue, while taking a pro-Armenia stance publicly. 

**Deputy Premier Overchuk:** The resumption of railway and road transfer between Armenia and Azerbaijan will create the conditions for $4.5b-$5b in Russian investments in Armenia. 

We have been discussing with businesses to understand what those investments could look like. We have a general understanding. This will be a boon for the Armenian economy. //

**Sinanyan:** The flow that we saw immediately after the war in Ukraine might be just the beginning. In this period, the number of Armenians who wish to move from Russia to Armenia is much greater compared to the previous year. 

In 2019-2022, more than 11k compatriots applied to permanently return to their homeland. Almost half of them applied since the start of the Ukraine war. Most of them were from Russia, Lebanon, and Syria.

We set up a working group to manage the flow of migration. The main flow is from Russia. Most of them are specialists. 

##... Armenia will have a new unified center to provide simplified services to diasporan repatriates 

The design of the building of the Center of Repatriation and Integration is ready and the construction will launch soon in downtown Yerevan. The Center will have everything necessary for repatriation and will cooperate with partners, like Repat Armenia Foundation, said Zareh Sinanyan. 

The Government approved the formation of the new Center [back in February](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/spgyed/news_feb102022_interview_warmy_expert_artsrun_6th/). What is it about?

>the Center will be the first of its kind in Armenia, will act as a single resource center for integration of the repatriates, and will significantly improve the affordability and efficiency of the whole process

The multilingual Center will help with documents, importing personal property, transferring a business, military service, legal & taxation, bank transfers & finances, and emergency assistance if needed.

##efforts are underway to switch to a new biometric passport system in Armenia 

The passport department has been overwhelmed with applications this year. The workload has increased by 3x in some of the offices. 

The department, which handles passports, ID cards, and various registrations in and outside of Armenia, has provided statistics for the summer months of 2021 and 2022:

Total applicants / for Passports / for ID cards (summer only)

2021: 407k / 114k / 26k

2022: 762k / 162k / 56k

The department said that efforts are underway to make a full switch to a new biometric system, which will make certain services available electronically and reduce the wait times.

##the president of the *European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)* about financing programs in Armenia 

**Odile Renaud-Basso:** The EBRD has invested more than €2 billion in 201 projects since Armenia's independence. We are focusing on the financial sector, sustainable energy projects, transport, value-added industrial companies, and the business environment.

During my recent visit, we signed loans with banks to assist small and medium-sized enterprises. We are also set to provide loans for women-led micro businesses.

EBRD provided a loan to Telecom Armenia for energy-efficient investments that are improving access to fast and reliable internet for 450,000 households. 

##... Armenia and Georgia recently [built a new ""Friendship Bridge""](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/wsn742/friday_aug192022_your_daily_news_digest_from/) on the border. EBRD is happy that the loan money wasn't squandered.

**Odile Renaud-Basso:** I was delighted to see the Prime Ministers of Armenia and Georgia inaugurate the Friendship Bridge. It's encouraging that [they finished it on time and didn't embezzle the funds], which is a rarity in infrastructure projects not only in the Caucasus but in different parts of the world. 

Considering this achievement despite the Covid-19 and the war, I am certain that there is a strong capacity in Armenia for successful implementation of such projects.

##... Armenia will modernize its Meghri customs checkpoint on the border with Iran 

**Odile Renaud-Basso:** Modernization of the Meghri border crossing is a very important project in the southern region of Syunik; we've teamed up with the EU to finance it. 

Armenia's IRS is currently in the process of assessing submitted bids. Construction works are expected to start by the end of this year and we expect them to finish within 3 years.

##... Armenia will purchase new buses for Yerevan public transport reforms with the support of EBRD 

**Odile Renaud-Basso:** We signed the project in 2021 under our ""Green Cities"" program. Its goal is to support municipalities to develop and invest in a coherent program of projects for the green transition. 

The project contains a €20 million loan and a €5 million grant. The project is on track and residents of Yerevan will see these new buses in H1 2023.

##... EBRD's investments in Armenia's agriculture  

**Odile Renaud-Basso:** We are identifying investments in industries with export potential, including in areas highlighted by the government's recent program of export promotion.

We are also supporting the agricultural sector by targeting investments along the whole value chain. Agriculture is a significant contributor to the economy. It also employs the largest share of the population - about the third, which raises a real productivity challenge. This is also true for other countries in the Caucasus.

There is a potential for improvement in productivity through investments in sustainable technologies, agricultural infrastructure, and knowledge transfer.

It's also possible to reduce the use of energy and water. Agriculture accounts for 80% of water withdrawal. 

##... EBRD is investing in renewable energy projects in Armenia; the country's public-private partnership laws have improved  

**Odile Renaud-Basso:** Renewables are at the core of our strategy for Armenia. Since 2019, we have been supporting the preparation of up to 105 MW solar capacity, and have committed to financing the first utility-scale solar plant.

##U.S. urges Russia to use its influence in South Caucasus to end hostilities 

**State Department spokesman:** Secretary Blinken has been personally engaged to end the hostilities. He put out a statement within hours, calling for an immediate cessation of violence. He was on the phone until after 1:00 a.m. Eastern with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

Blinken urged President Aliyev to cease hostilities immediately, to disengage military forces, and to work to resolve all outstanding issues. 

**Reporter:** Russia tried to broker a ceasefire but it didn't work. The US and Russia sent their representatives to meet with the sides almost simultaneously. Are you coordinating with Russia?

**Spokesman:** We have called upon all countries in the region to use their influence constructively. This escalation is not in anyone's interest. Russia has outsized influence with both sides, and we have called Russia, and we do call on Russia to use that influence and leverage to end the hostilities.

##U.S. does not accept Azerbaijan's claims that the hostilities began after a ""provocation"" by Armenia 

**Pro-Azeri reporter:** It began after Armenians conducted sporadic artillery attacks cross-border. At the same time, Blinken adopted a one-sided approach by urging only Azerbaijan's Aliyev to end the hostilities. Can the U.S. contribute to peace if it adopts a one-sided approach?

**State Dept.:** Rather than assigning blame, we recognize that there is unlikely to be one proximate cause. The hostilities should end. The fact is that we have seen significant evidence of Azerbaijani shelling inside Armenia, and significant damage to Armenian infrastructure, but right now our focus is on achieving that cessation of hostilities.

##ranking European Parliament officials condemn Azerbaijan's aggression, call for Azeri troops to withdraw from Armenia 

The head of the European Parliament's Committee of Foreign Relations, joined by rapporteurs on Armenia and Azerbaijan, issued a statement.

**Statement:** We condemn in the strongest possible terms the large-scale military confrontations on the border and in the sovereign territory of Armenia.

We particularly urge Azerbaijan to stop immediately its offensive, to move back its troops to their initial positions, and to fully respect the territorial integrity of Armenia. 

The reported attacks on civilian population centers and infrastructure are totally unacceptable. Any steps that could lead to further escalation should be avoided at all cost.

There is a historical opportunity to achieve a durable and sustainable peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan and it should not be wasted. //

**MPs from Committee of Foreign Relations:** We express solidarity to you regarding the aggression committed by the Azerbaijani armed forces against the sovereign territory of your country.

##British lawmakers call for sanctions against Azerbaijan, and for UN Sec. Con. to take steps 

**MPs, led by Tim Loughton:** Azerbaijan has attacked the sovereign territory of Armenia, including civilian infrastructure. 

These attacks are not targeted on the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region but on internationally recognised sovereign boundaries of Armenia itself and were entirely unprovoked and without justification.

We express our strongest condemnation of the Azerbaijan regime for this latest act of violence and extend our deep concern for the victims and their families.

These acts of aggression and war crimes have clearly been timed to take advantage of the world’s attention to Ukraine and the widespread mourning for the death of Queen Elizabeth, and such aggressive opportunism needs to be condemned in the strongest terms and met with a robust response. 

We request the UK Government to join other nations in demanding an immediate end to the Azerbaijan aggression and bring forward sanctions for as long as it continues its unjustified actions. 

We also ask the UK Government to support the request to the United Nations to consider the matter in an emergency session and put its weight behind an ending of this hostile action.

The Azerbaijan regime still needs to be held properly accountable for its war crimes committed against Armenia and the people of Nagorno-Karabakh a couple of years ago.

##European Parliament MPs accuse Azerbaijan of violating UN Charter, call for sanctions 

**Group of MPs to Josep Borrell:** This unprovoked and unjustified aggression against the sovereign territory of Armenia is yet another flagrant violation by Azerbaijan of the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act, and the Trilateral Statement of 9 November 2020.

In light of Azerbaijan’s clearly pre-planned and premeditated aggression, there is an urgent need for the EU to take decisive actions to immediately stop Azerbaijan’s aggression.

We consider that the EU should have an urgent, multi-level intervention and make sure that it will not be repeated, through an effective sanctions mechanism. //

##European Parliament MPs: we should not buy gas from Azerbaijan

**Defense Ministry:** Artillery, mortars, and drones are being used, despite the calls by the international community to end the hostilities. The Armenian soldiers are taking adequate retaliatory steps and continue to fully fulfill the combat tasks.

Despite our numerous calls, there are instances when people and media outlets circulate the area of hostilities, thus helping the adversary understand the accuracy of their strikes. Do not endanger lives by sharing materials.

Beware that Azerbaijan is often circulating fabricated and old footage from the 2020 war. //

##statements by the international community were targeted directly at Azerbaijan: Foreign Minister Mirzoyan 

**MP Vigen Khachatryan:** The West has directly accused Azerbaijan of aggression, while the CSTO's response to Armenia's petition is unclear. Moreover, a Russian TV channel has claimed that CSTO forces have refused to support Armenia. Can you clarify?

**FM Mirzoyan:** The international response was, indeed, quite targeted. Certain states and organizations could have done better, but nevertheless, diplomatic work has been done in this area. 

As for CSTO, they will send an observation mission, likely tomorrow *[CSTO later said it will be next week]*. The rest is being discussed. We believe our petition was properly discussed at CSTO.   

**MP Vigen Khachatryan:** Unlike in 2020, this time we can feel diplomatic support from the international community, and I'd like to thank you for your efforts as Foreign Minister. Considering the peculiarities of Russia, I'm starting to think that CSTO's refusal to assist is perhaps a good thing.

**FM Mirzoyan:** I have the right not to agree with you by 100%. Again, the CSTO's response is unprecedented. This is the first time they will send a mission like this.

##I am ready to sign any document that will protect the sovereignty of Armenia: Pashinyan 

During the parliament speech, Pashinyan said he won't hesitate to sign documents that ensure lasting peace and security for Armenia, even if it's at the cost of his career and more ""treason"" accusations.

**Pashinyan on Facebook:** [My words](https://youtu.be/VmamhB3v8cs) were twisted again to claim I'm planning to sign a ""treacherous"" document soon, or I have already signed it. There is no ""document"" on the table, no ""document"" is being prepared, and there will be no ""document"" in the foreseeable future. 

Certain people with Armenian last names have joined Azerbaijani propaganda to circulate false claims in order to weaken the morale of our soldiers. This deserves a response. 

Azerbaijan had earlier offered a 5-point proposal. There is nothing unacceptable in it, but it doesn't address the issue of Nagorno Karabakh Armenians' rights and the status stemming from it. 

We will not give any corridor to Azerbaijan. Armenia's territorial integrity is the red line. 

If we see there is a solution - flawed but still a solution - that will protect Armenia's interests at the cost of my career, I will go for it. That's what I said today. My job is not to say things that sound sweet to your ears. //

##Pashinyan about Azerbaijan's border claims and maps

**MP Papoyan:** Tell us about the border demarcation process. 

**Pashinyan:** First of all, the notion that we need to demarcate to ""create"" an AM-AZ border is false, because the border already exists, and it was officially and internationally recognized after the fall of the USSR. So Azerbaijan is, in fact, violating Armenia's official state borders. 

The proposed demarcation works need to be conducted with the use of maps that have a legal background. Anyone can draw the map of their dream and present it as a map, but it is just an art piece if it wasn't an outcome of legal processes. If Azerbaijan claims we should use pre-USSR maps, then can we go back to the times when Azerbaijan did not exist?

If Azerbaijan does not recognize the Soviet maps, and since Nagorno Karabakh was within Soviet Azerbaijan during USSR, does that mean Azerbaijan does not recognize Nagorno Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan today?

This is an important topic because it also affects Azerbaijan's borders with Georgia, Russia, and Iran. If Azerbaijan doesn't recognize the Soviet-era Armenia borders, then do they recognize their border with Iran?

[source,](https://youtu.be/0RIdKVR64lk?t=905)



##casualties; how much land were lost; Article 4 of CSTO 

**MP:** Can you update us on casualties and losses?

**Pashinyan:** Yesterday I informed you about 49 losses and stated that it wasn't the final figure because the MOD has to verify first before reporting. As of today, they have verified 105 losses on our side. 

Azerbaijan has invaded certain territories, which is why we have contacted the CSTO. Had Azeris not captured territories, we would not have contacted CSTO. We initiated Article 4:  aggression on one member is aggression on everyone.

We've requested military assistance from CSTO to restore the territorial integrity of Armenia and remove Azeri forces from our territories. This includes the lands they invaded in 2021. The aggressor must leave all of our territories.

We are satisfied that CSTO held a session on Tuesday. We believe there was an honest discussion, and the minimum necessary steps have been taken for this phase. 

We have also contacted our Western partners, and they will soon raise the issue in the UN Security Council. 

**MP:** What about territorial losses?

**Pashinyan:** Last year Azerbaijan invaded 40 km^2. This year they've invaded another 10 km^2. We will not accept this aggression. They must leave.

##is there a need for martial law? 

**MP:** Some of our citizens are calling for martial law and mobilization, while others claim that if you declare martial law, it will only be because you don't want [ARF Ishkhan Saghatelyan] to launch an impeachment process against you. 

**Pashinyan:** The resolution to declare martial law has been on my table since yesterday, and we've been analyzing the situation with the Security Council and others. If martial law has not been declared that's because we need to take into account its effectiveness at this time, and the downsides associated with its impact on certain other processes. That doesn't mean it won't be declared tomorrow. The situation is being analyzed multiple times a day.

##Pashinyan: it is necessary more than ever to pull back troops on both sides of the state border and install a monitoring mission 

**Pashinyan:** Last year we proposed a mirrored withdrawal of forces, and these latest events are proof that the withdrawal and the installation of an international monitoring mission are necessary more than ever. 

During yesterday's CSTO mission they discussed the formation of an international group that will monitor the ceasefire. We must continue to pursue this strategy. We will use every diplomatic tool to restore our territorial integrity.

Yesterday's CSTO meeting was very important because several member-states expressed views that reflect ours. //

##Question: What steps were undertaken to strengthen the army and win the war? 

**Pashinyan:** Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in 2018, I adopted the principle ""everything for the army"". Not once has my administration rejected a request from the military for a financial allocation. The acquisition of Su-30 jets is the perfect example.

Moreover. The military gave me a list of weapons to be acquired within a decade, worth $12 billion. They were surprised when I agreed. They wondered if I could find the resources, and I told them yes. 

Today we have generals with big mouths talking trash after the war. Their primary goal, on the very first seconds of the war on September 27, was to desert as soon as possible. This is all being uncovered now with detailed facts and criminal investigations. 

I learned about a shortage of helmets and bulletproof vests only after the war had begun. Certain generals claim it was ""written there"". It was written on one of the back pages of a 100-page document that the Prime Minister does not read. Whatever they requested from me was granted to them: millions for artillery shells, $100 million for jets, ֏15 billion for food, etc. And today, people who received those funds are in jail, because it turns out they embezzled the funds by delivering old and dysfunctional weapons instead of buying new ones.

##Pashinyan unloads on former National Security Services agents, accuses them of spying for other states and allowing Azeris to recruit spies within Armenia

**MP:** I don't think we were strict enough towards people who helped the enemy during the war by spreading rumors such as ""the government has sold these lands, just leave the positions"". Shouldn't we be stricter against this?

**Pashinyan:** We were strict enough. The problem is our institutions are not sufficiently developed. There are people whom I had instructed to be ""strict"". They were later fired. Today they are on the streets. Some of them formed a ""Union of National Security Services Officers"". How do you even have the audacity to show your face on the street? Half of the country was a spy while you managed the agency. There was no ""national security"" under your tenure. You are simply a brigade of khopanchi. You should be investigated by NSS today to find out how many countries you've spied for.

##we noticed the increase in the number of Turkish cargo planes flying to Azerbaijan before the aggression: Foreign Ministery Mirzoyan 

**FM Mirzoyan during a meeting with foreign diplomats:** Azerbaijan has been making militaristic threats in recent months. You know this region very well, and how Azerbaijan operates. 

Beginning on September 2, every day their Defense Ministry published false statements accusing Armenia of provocations. At the same time, we received reports about cargo jets flying from Turkey to Azerbaijan. 

On September 5-9, Turkey and Azerbaijan conducted joint training.

On September 10, their army command ordered troops to ""be prepared"" for action. They also took steps to secure medical assistance for his soldiers on the border. This was all done before the 2020 war as well. 

**Mirzoyyan gives context:**

During the August 31 meeting in Brussels, Aliyev made it clear he doesn't plan to discuss the Nagorno Karabakh conflict with Armenia, because he claims the ""conflict is resolved"" and that Nagorno Karabakh is an ""internal"" issue and must be regulated per Azerbaijani constitution.

Obviously, this is unacceptable for us. It doesn't resemble a will to negotiate around the conflict. 

Azerbaijan is also attempting to gain an extraterritorial corridor. We've stated repeatedly that we will only give them access via a road after reaching an agreement around the legal regulations of the transit, which should respect the sovereignty of Armenia.

Azerbaijan has violated the UN Charter and Helsinki Act by unleashing aggression. This was enabled by the international community's lack of targeted statements and direct condemnation after Azerbaijan's similar aggression in May 2021. //

[source,](https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1092533.html)


##Question: What is Azerbaijan pursuing with this aggression?

**Pashinyan:** You may find this very strange, but Azerbaijan is unsatisfied with the outcome of the 2020 war. Obviously, I can't disclose many details, but you must understand that no matter how unhappy Armenians are about the 9 Nov. 2020 tripartite statement, it has certain favorable articles for us, and Azerbaijan has been attempting to ""archive"" this document after the war. What do they not like about the tripartite statement?

1) The ""Nagorno Karabakh"" exists.

2) Nagorno Karabakh has a line of contact, the protection of which is guaranteed by peacekeepers from Russia, 

3) We have a Lachin corridor that guarantees a connection between Armenia and Artsakh, and it's protected by peacekeepers. 

Azerbaijan is fighting against these three today. We can feel this based on the negotiations during tripartite meetings. 

[source,](https://youtu.be/0RIdKVR64lk?t=2670)


##Question: Are there countries, other than Turkey and Azerbaijan, that want a sovereign corridor for Azerbaijan via Armenia? 

**Pashinyan:** We should not care what ""others"" think about a ""corridor"". We are not going to give them a ""corridor"". Period. We won't give one. 

Second, we have an agreement with our allies and the international community, that there won't be a ""corridor"". There is not a single country that discusses a ""corridor"" with us behind closed doors. If anyone tries, we will interrupt that discussion. What ""corridor""? Who made up this ""corridor""? Where is it written ""corridor""? 

If you are literate, read the November 9 statement and find the word ""corridor"" in it. Actually, there is a mention of a corridor, which is the ""Lachin corridor"" connecting Armenia to Nagorno Karabakh, under the control of peacekeepers.  

Regarding the implementation of paragraph 9 of the Nov. 9 statement [unblocking roads], a new follow-up statement was signed on 11 January 2021, which clearly explains what the Nov. 9 statement's paragraph 9 truly means. 

##... Pashinyan opens a secret 

As we've stated before, we are ready to allow Azerbaijan to use our roads to connect to Nakhijevan. Armenia itself would greatly benefit from the unblocking of regional communications. 

I will open a secret. We've introduced a new package. I personally handed it over to Ilham Aliyev in Brussels. The moment they accept it, the moment we will implement it without delay. //

##commentary by a pro-Western analyst about Azerbaijan's goals 

**Armen Chibukhchyan:** Azerbaijan does not truly care about the rest of Artsakh - they need a corridor via Syunik. Aliyev understands very well that once the blockade is lifted, Armenia will gain new and powerful opportunities, allowing it to become more powerful and more politically important than Azerbaijan, within 15-20 years. 

Azerbaijan is negotiating with Iran for the North-South trade route to pass through Azerbaijan and not Armenia, and unfortunately, they have China's backing. On the other hand, Iran has a consensus with India, supported by the West; they want the North-South to pass through Armenia. 

Aliyev does not have the political strength to invade another country and keep it. He understands that sooner or later he will be forced to return the stolen, and he will be declared an aggressor by UN resolutions. 

Aliyev's goal now is to break Armenia's will and force it to voluntarily give a Syunik ""corridor"" for legally unobstructed transfers. Russia and Azerbaijan both want Armenia to lose its sovereignty. They will share things, come up with ideas like a ""union with Russia"", or whatever, but this will all be temporary because Russia's fate is sealed in Ukraine. 

Aliyev understands that if Armenia doesn't break now, he will lose over 80% of the gains achieved by the 2020 war. He knows that the Nagorno Karabakh process will reach the OSCE Minsk Group, which the West is openly pushing for today. Once under the Minsk Group, Aliyev won't be able to ignore Nagorno Karabakh Armenians' rights and their status. Moreover, those negotiations can last 15-20 years, during which Armenia will regain enough strength to truly defend Artsakh.  

In 15-20 years Armenia should be part of the Western bloc and form a democratic axis with Ukraine and Georgia. It is becoming clear now that tomorrow Iran will export oil and gas to Europe via Ukraine, and it should be done via Armenia. 
 
Azerbaijan understands this and tries to extort as much as possible while it can. Ukraine already understands who Aliyev, Azerbaijan, and Turkey truly are, despite those ""Bayraktars"" and supportive messages. I have given dozens of interviews to Ukrainian outlets. While at first I felt constrained to criticize Azerbaijan in front of Ukrainians, today they understand it themselves and approach Turkey-Azerbaijan with suspicion. 

Moreover, Ukraine understands this because the West is explaining to them who Turkey and Azerbaijan really are, and who Ukraine's allies will be in the future. *[explanation further below]*

Last year when Azerbaijan began negotiating with Iran to build a road to Nakhijevan, bypassing Syunik, I warned you not to cheer yet, because they would still demand a ""corridor"" from Armenia.

Aliyev understands that if he doesn't gain the corridor now, even if he takes all of Karabakh today, in 15 years Armenia will use the aforementioned trade route with Iran to gain strength and liberate Karabakh. This is why Azerbaijan and Russia are working together to take the corridor from Armenia. 

Aliyev doesn't need Stepanakert. That's why he gave it to Russia during the war, in exchange for something else: Russia gets Karabakh, Azerbaijan gets southern Syunik corridor.

Now we have even more indicators that this theory is true. Why do you think Tatar Rubo moved to Karabakh not long ago? *[Tatar Rubo = Ruben Vardanyan, a Kremlin-linked Russian-Armenian billionaire, philanthropist, benefactor, earlier this year suggested that if all else fails Armenia should join Russia and become a province like Tatarstan, hence the nickname ""Tatar Rubo"".]* 

Explain why Putin's purse Rubo is in Karabakh today. Have you researched his background? By the way, there are reports that Rubo is a co-owner of Kamaz factory, which has launched a service center in Karabakh territories occupied by Azerbaijan. Russia would gladly give southern Syunik to Azerbaijan, and appoint Rubo as the leader of Karabakh. Is there a better candidate than him? 

It won't matter if Armenia recognizes Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan. That's not going to stop Azerbaijan. They want southern Syunik. Forget about everything else. Aliyev is scared to death about Armenia's prospects if it's allowed to develop peacefully, especially if it becomes a Western ally. Azerbaijan will lose Artsakh in 20 years if they don't bring Armenia to its knees by getting the corridor today. 

When in May 2021 Pashinyan threatened Russia that he would appeal to others, I told him that it was a pointless threat, because Russia would not sell him any weapons because of Azerbaijan. Russia was not held back by ""Ukraine war"" in 2021. The geopolitics crumbled in 2020 in Nagorno Karabakh, not in 2022 in Ukraine, and the West is going to punish Turkey and Azerbaijan for that, because the two have conspired with Russia around ""3+3"" and other things to kick the West out of the Caucasus. 

Do you think it is a coincidence that the West demonstratively disagrees with Azerbaijan about the conflict being resolved? Coincidence that the U.S. has appointed Philip Reeker and is actively pushing to resume the Minsk Group? Coincidence that the U.S. and French ambassadors refused to visit the occupied Shushi? The West remembers very well how Aliyev broke the world order. 

Turkey is playing a double game in the Ukraine conflict. They don't want Russia to swallow Ukraine, but they don't want Ukraine to fully defeat Russia, either. Turkey is only now beginning to realize that Ukraine could eventually become a significant power and compete against them in the Black Sea and Caucasus [presumably via energy links]. This is why Turkey is also assisting Russia now [economically, anti-sanctions]. Putin wants to give the Syunik corridor to Azerbaijan, so Russia can trade with its new buddy Turkey freely and unobstructed.  

Pashinyan is unable to explain that to the Armenian public. Does he feel constrained? Why is Pashinyan still trying to appease Putin, and why did he not contact the UN Security Council earlier - during last year's invasion? 

Russia's fate is sealed. It is no different than Hitler's Germany today. Even China is keeping a distance. Russia will be defeated in Ukraine, and will lose influence across the world eventually, followed by an internal implosion, and efforts by the West to de-nuclearize it. It's over. Why do we still have people who cling to Russia? How many troops does Russia have in its Armenian military base today? They went and died in Ukraine. They withdrew the weapons. What is the point of keeping the base?

Pashinyan [stated today](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/xdigh2/sep132022_military_aggression_by_azerbaijan/) that manufacturing weapons is difficult, even if the government provides sufficient funding. That is correct. Everyone cheers on the drones made in Armenia. It's all bullshit. Forget about pro-Russia Armenia being able to produce quality weapons. Bayraktars are Bayraktars because they use dozens of Western components that Armenia cannot obtain today. No matter what illusio"

##beware of fake posted by Azerbaijani agents

There is a video allegedly showing two ambushed Armenian soldiers in trenches, screaming ""our army has abandoned us"". It is a clear fake, with them having a non-Armenian accent, a first-person-view camera being ""conveniently"" attached at a place where Armenians don't wear it, and it being made overly-dramatic for ""psychological impact"".

Another similar fake was posted yesterday. The voice-over guy sounds the same.

One of the Azeri pilots who died on Sep-27 is Major Qasim Abbas oglu. He was a State Border Security (SBS) officer and not from the Defense Ministry. That means the helicopter he was flying was likely Mi-17. This is also proof that Azeri SBS was engaged in Artsakh. *(they are usually near the Tavush border).*

Yesterday an Armenian MP called for Azeri ethnic minorities to check the names of dead Azer soldiers and realize that Aliyev's tactic is to send ethnic minorities to front lines to be used as disposable pawns.

Some Talysh-Azeri minorities have the same complaint. A man says 5 out of 7 recently-verified-killed Azeri soldiers had Talysh names. *""the Aliyev regime massacres the Talysh in the war zone,""* complained the man.

Russia's largest govt-run *Channel 1* outlet has a prime-time talk-show called ""Time will tell"", which invited Armenian, Azeri, and Russian experts for debates.

Russian reporter was invited to explain the situation. He mentioned the situation in Stepanakert and how Azeris [failed to take and] damaged the northern highway connecting Armenia to Artsakh, with Turkish Bayraktar drones. 

**Azeri Guest:** how do you know Azeris used Turkish drones?

**Russian Reporter:** these drones are made in Turkey.

**Russian Host:** hold on. Let's assume the drones were of ""unknown origin"". Now let's analyze which drones they were.

**Russian Reporter:** ... the Azeri side doesn't hide it's Turkish...

**Russian Host responds to Azeri Guest:** here is a video [shows a Bayraktar video] published by Azeris showing the destruction of several Armenian vehicles. The footage appears to be recorded from a Turkish drone. Period.

**Russian Reporter continues:** we visited Stepanakert and saw the outcome of the Azeri GRAD missile attack that was used against a completely peaceful civilian house.

**Russian Host:** have you learned any info on who started this war?

**Russian Reporter:** locals say Azerbaijan began bombing at 7:10 am yesterday. I know each side will blame the other, but I'm more concerned about civilians. I spoke with 2 Armenian kids in a bomb shelter. Their house was bombed. It's not even near any military object.

**Azeri guest:** Pashinyan started this. He escalated the situation this year. 

**Russian Guest enters chat:** so you're telling me it's Armenians who started it, while it was Azeris who launched a partial draft ahead of time and brought reinforcements?

**Azeri Guest:** .... because Armenians provoked 

**Russian Guest:** ... ""provoked"" by ""using words"" but they didn't open fire. [host interrupts]

**Russian Host to Azeri Guest:** when you say Pashinyan is the one who verbally provoked, I can assure you that both sides made provocative statements, including the Turkish side.

*[the main theme became the Turkish involvement in the conflict. The Russian host and guests are not pleased. They blasted Erdogan's statements.]*

**Russian Host:** let's use logic about who started the war. Here is a video *[of Azeri soldiers being destroyed during an unsuccessful attempt to capture northern highway through a gorge near Mrav]*. Someone gave those soldiers an order to move forward. Why?

**Armenian Guest:** obviously the order was given by the Azeri govt. It's elementary logic. Armenia has no reason to start a war. Karabakh is already de-facto free. 

**Azeri Guest:** Nope, Armenians started it. It's beneficial for Armenia to provoke a war.

**Armenian Guest:** why would they?

**Azeri Guest:** so Artsakh separatists can launch a process for independence. *(apparently crack pipe is on sale on Amazon. Cyber Crackday. Black Plaqueday. Big if true.)*

**Russian Host sits next to Azeri guest:** are you sure about that? 

**Azeri Guest:** Yes. Why not?

*[theme changes about Syrian mercenaries]*

**Russian Host:** I can't confirm 100%, but here is a video from Azerbaijan showing a column of fighters in pickup trucks with flags and [Allahu Akbar] chants. Do these men chant in Azeri or Arabic?


**Azeri Guest:** they are Azeri because I heard their accent with ""e"" instead of ""a"" while chanting ""akbar"". Syrians don't have ""e"". It's unique to Turkic.

**Armenian Guest:** the pro-Turkish fighters in northern Syria are ethnic Turkmen, not necessarily Arab.

**Russian Guest:** we can send it to professional linguists for analysis.

##Syunik border analysis: what we know so far about events before the encroachment

Long before the May 12th events began unfolding, Armenian and Azeri troops began stationing around the lake. Armenia owns ~80% of the lake. It was reported that neither side had permanent positions in this area due to harsh weather conditions, which has only recently begun warming. 

Individual Azeri infiltrators were first observed near the Armenian side of the lake in late April. By May 5th, several Armenian outlets reported that Azeris had ""full control"" of the lake.

The same day on May 5th, Syunik governor denied that Azeris had ""full control"" of the lake, saying that Maj.Gen. Jirayr Poghosyan, the commander of 1st Army Corps, was observing this area, that he spent the past two days in this area, and that he denies that Azeris have ""full control"". 

The general's presence and prior reports lead us to believe that Armenians did have some quantities of troops in this area prior to Azeri intrusion, that it wasn't completely abandoned, and that sometime in the early May, small groups of Azeris may have begun penetrating through cracks by taking advantage of the fact that there was no traditional trenching system yet.

Regarding conspiracy theories that the government intentionally ""gave"" the area, this is unlikely as it should be noted that Maj.Gen. Jirayr Poghosyan, the general who was observing this area, is an anti-government ""opposition"" general who recently co-signed army chief Onik Gasparyan's letter that called Pashinyan incompetent and called for his resignation.

Whether it was general Poghosyan's incompetent deployment decisions that lead to Armenia not having border trenchers or enough soldiers in this area, or someone else's incompetent orders, or it was truly because of poor weather conditions combined with difficult terrain as it was officially reported, remains to be seen and warrants an investigation.

Commander of an army corps Samvel Minasyan later briefed that Armenians and Azeris stationed troops near the lake area back in December of 2020 and that Azeris were first spotted in large quantities (250) on May 12th; that's when they advanced 3.5km.

By May 12th, Azeris had accumulated 250 troops in various parts of Armenian territories (Syunik and Gegharkunik). Negotiations began for their withdrawal and Armenia officially contacted the CSTO military bloc.

The U.S. and France, later joined by India and Greece, urged Azeris to immediately withdraw, while Russia offered Armenia and Azerbaijan its mediation to conduct border demarcation. 

In the following days, Armenia reported that Azerbaijan partially withdrew and that Armenians increased their presence. Armenia reported that Azeris withdrew more troops days later.

Deputy Premier Tigran Avinyan and reporters paid a visit to the lake's south-western shores. 

The Azeri intrusion was not just in Syunik. They also entered Gegharkunik province, near Vardenis borders. On May 18, the MOD reported that a confrontation took place between Armenian and Azeri troops on May 17th in Gegharkunik [Vardenis], in which Armenians [unofficially] reportedly unsuccessfully tried to push Azeris out. 

On May 19, the video of the Vardenis scuffle was circulated, leading to confusion that it was a new incident in Syunik. MOD denied reports about a new scuffle. A fact-checker later found that it was the old Vardenis incident from May 17.

On May 19, the MOD reported that they brought additional reinforcements to increase the Armenian presence and to prevent Azeris from ""conducting provocations"". MOD reports that Armenians have control over the roads used by Azeri groups that are deep within Armenian territory (up to 3.5km). Azerbaijan also increased the number of its troops in various parts, bringing it to 600 by May 20th.

Several groups of Azeri troops continue to remain in Armenian territories. The MOD said they reserve the right to apply military force if Azeris do not withdraw peacefully. Armenia said it will not negotiate the giveaway of Armenian territories in exchange for their withdrawal.

Russia and the U.S. urged for an official border demarcation process. The first discussions about demarcation began last year, after the war. It was reported that Armenia and Azerbaijan will create expert groups, likely mediated by Russia.

Earlier on Monday, Pashinyan announced that Armenia and Azerbaijan would both benefit from the official demarcation process and that Azerbaijan is intentionally sabotaging the demarcation efforts by demanding that it be done only between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia, on the other hand, wants Russia to act as a mediator.

##Pashinyan discusses border demarcation and a document to establish a demarcation commission

Armenia and Azerbaijan are yet to formally clarify their borders after the independence. For this, the two must create a commission tasked with examining old maps and documents for the official delimitation and demarcation. 

Former president Serj Sargsyan's fugitive son-in-law Mikael ""Mishik"" Minasyan shared a copy of the demarcation document drafted by Russia and attempted to portray that as something nefarious and secret done by the Armenian government behind people's back. Others noted that it had been officially announced last year that a commission would be formed for demarcation. 

It is not known whether this is a final [document](https://armlur.am/1108110/) [update: it's not the final form, can be amended, and has not even been discussed yet]. It should be noted that Minasyan has a record of misleading the public while sharing various pieces of documents in the past. 

Last year they shared Azerbaijan's version of a document and claimed that's what Pashinyan planned to sign. What the three countries ended up signing turned out to be different and did not include anything about Armenia unilaterally giving away enclaves to Azerbaijan, as the leaked document had suggested. 

During today's speech, Pashinyan accused the former regime of ""once again"" acting as Azerbaijan's propagandists within Armenia.

**Pashinyan about the border demarcation:** the overall situation has not changed on the border. In various locations, Azerbaijan has 500-600 troops in areas belonging to Armenia. Our army's task is to limit their potential actions. The political task is not to allow armed clashes so the situation won't get out of control, and for Azeri forces to leave Armenia.

Enormous diplomatic work has been done and is being done. That's why MFA Ayvazyan is not present here today [government session]. He is working with our colleagues right now. Our MOD and Deputy Ministers are also tasked with diplomatic work.

I consider their work to be effective because our international colleagues share our views regarding borders: Azeri forces must leave. Azerbaijan is taking steps to remain in the territories, it has an obvious ally [referring to Turkey].

**Azerbaijan's ""agents"" in Armenia**

As I've said earlier, in the modern world, information warfare is sometimes more important than what is actually happening. I will not hesitate to say that Azerbaijan has its information agents among the Armenian political elites. Their activities are nothing new.

In 2020, these internal Azeri agents were inviting Azerbaijan to attack Armenia *[Hrant Bagratyan in June 2020]*. While in Parliament and elsewhere, they displayed border paths through which the border could be crossed without detection.

Today, these agents are aiding Azerbaijan to counter our diplomatic efforts while presenting the Armenian government as being the pro-Azeri conspirators. 

**Mishik's redacted document**

We have a very disrespectful situation towards society. They circulated a document 90% of which is redacted with black ink. And they present this document as ""proof"" that the government is signing an anti-Armenian document.

If you're going to share the document, then share the full text so the public can see it all. Why are you hiding it? Once again, they can only be described as Azerbaijan's information warfare agents within Armenia. 

How do they obtain these documents? Likely from Azerbaijan because it's part of a trilateral discussion between Armenia, Russia, and Azerbaijan. 

**the demarcation**

The solution that we have achieved with our international partners is 100% in line with Armenia's interests. Not 99.9%, but 100%. 

If Azerbaijan agrees to the conditions as they are described, I will certainly sign that document. I cannot publish that document because we are still in the negotiation process and that would not be ethical to do so.

**Azeri propaganda**

The Azerbaijani propaganda cuts 4 minutes from a 2-hour-long of story and presents it. Its Armenian propagandists within Armenia then share the material, while hiding from the public that the source is Azerbaijan.

This is nothing more than a destructive activity in the rear. If the 21st-century laws do not provide us with mechanisms, then it should be the public to respond to this, because first and foremost, this is a disrespect towards the Armenian public.

**how did Azeris enter Armenia?**

Let's discuss how Azeris were able to enter our territories. After the war, the borders became a few hundred kilometers longer. The areas in question are mountainous with difficult relief. It is covered in snow for most of the year and no engineering activity is possible here. It's similar on both sides of the border.

The Azeri actions are in direct violation of the November 9 statement, too. Diplomacy will work on this.

**the decision to contact CSTO military bloc**

There is criticism on why we contacted CSTO without firing shots first. Anyone who has ever read a few paragraphs from the CSTO agreement will know that that's the purpose of CSTO, to resolve a crisis without firing shots.

CSTO is not for firing at someone then asking CSTO to come to join and fire, too. It's for de-escalation and diplomatic solutions.

**what is the reason behind Azeri provocations?**

One option that we've discussed is Azerbaijan's attempt to incite a war. If you pay attention to the part of Syunik where the events are unfolding, it's the narrowest 26km belt in Armenia [between Azerbaijan and Nakhijevan]. We could have had uncontrollable events in this place if things escalated.

Our decision to contact CSTO was the right one. At the moment, at least, it is justifying itself. We have not reached our goal yet, however.

**influencing the elections**

By observing these internal processes, we cannot rule out the possibility that Azerbaijan wanted to influence the election process, and perhaps to aid their propagandists and agents within Armenia.

**demarcation and delimitation**

There is a lot of talk about demarcation and delimitation. Now they want to scare and terrorize the public by using this topic. Armenia needs border clarification just as much as Azerbaijan does. It is the strongest security guarantee.

This isn't a simple process. I'm not aware of any former USSR states in our region that have finished this process. Let me clarify what demarcation and delimitation are:

Delimitation is when you draw the borders on maps, while demarcation is when you fix the corresponding area on the ground. There has been much talk about ""GPS"" and so on. In other words, they use ""GPS"" to verify whether the corresponding position is the correct one or not. 

**regional trade routes**

One of our primary goals is to unblock the regional trade routes. It's important for Armenia as much as it's important for Azerbaijan. Armenia was placed under blockade in 1992. Once again, we aren't talking about giving away any ""corridors"".

**long-term peace**

We have the political will to resolve the conflict. We need to address these difficult issues to have centuries-long peace. It is a difficult process that requires political will and the ability to receive blows. We need to be open about this.  

**future of border protection**

The ideal solution is for the Armenian and Azeri [regular] armies to pull back from the entire border and allow Border Guards to take over. 

**final words**

Once again, I call upon our society not to succumb to the provocations of the Azerbaijani propaganda network within Armenia. We work and will work tirelessly to protect the national and state interests of Armenia and Artsakh.

##calls are made to make the demarcation process more transparent and to fight misinformation

Human Rights Ombudsman Tatoyan urged the government to fight the misinformation by taking the initiative in its own hands during times of crisis, by providing faster and more detailed information. 

He spoke about the dangers of an ""information vacuum that can be filled with misinformation and then used against the state."" He believes the unredacted document should be posted.

President Sarkissian and other officials said it would be best if the full document is published.

##content of the document shared by an opposition outlet:

Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia declare that for the sake of strengthening peace and staying true to the November 9 and January 11 statement, the three sides agree to form a  joint expert commission for demarcation.

AM and AZ will form their commissions by May 31. Russia will form a similar commission to act as an adviser.

The commissions will be lead by people selected according to each country's laws.

The commission will hold its first session by June 30 to agree on the direction and will confirm the appointment of other members of the commission.

More meetings will be held within the next few months.

All the steps underlined in the final document will be resolved only politically-diplomatically. 

https://armlur.am/1108110/

##Pashinyan answers questions about demarcation process  / Parliamennt session / enclaves in Armenia and Azerbaijan / demarcation

**Pashinyan about the Vardenis border incident:** as I announced days earlier, the tension was growing on the borders. What happened was mass brawls between Armenian and Azeri soldiers on the borders. Then the situation calmed down. No guns were used but there were mass fights across the borders.

Now the opposition claims the MOD denied it before confirming it. [Note: MOD reported the incident but denied claims that others incident took place.]

The way reporting works is the army briefs the MOD about the outcome of an event in general. ""This event happened, and this was the result."" 

Azerbaijan cut 3 minutes from the incident that lasted 2 hours and gave it to its information agents within Armenia. *[another portion of the incident was later published reportedly showing Armenians expelling Azeris from an area.]*

**Pashinyan about borders:** our stance remains the same: Azer troops must leave Armenia without conditions. Since we still don't have demarcation and delimitation, these conflicts can arise in the future again. Should this turn into an international crisis every time? 

This is why an offer was made to create a demarcation commission. The discussions are still ongoing so it would be inappropriate for me to publish the document right now. 

What is the important part of it? It says the two sides will be required to use diplomacy instead of moving troops to resolve border disputes. This is nothing new. 

Earlier I announced that a demarcation commission will be formed only after Azeris leave. We can add this in the document, for example, Azeris have 3-4 days to leave. This is the whole story. There is nothing secret going on.

**Pashinyan about enclaves and Artsvashen:** opposition only talks about giving away lands. Why don't they also remember that we have Artsvashen? Why are they always siding with foreign propaganda theses?

After the first Artsakh war, Armenia continues to have 70 km^2 of Republic of Armenia lands under Azeri control. Today, we have border villages that do not have arable lands as a result.  It's true that we also hold lands that were part of Soviet Azerbaijan. These issues need to be resolved. One option is to leave things the way they are.

**Opposition MPs:** foreign Minister (ministry) said they weren't aware of the demarcation document.

**Pashinyan:** the demarcation commission, which was formed in November 2020, is lead by the Deputy Foreign Minister. Russia sent the documents to the Russian embassy, the embassy sent it to the Deputy Minister, the Deputy Minister sent it to me. Perhaps Foreign Ministry officials tried to distance themselves after learning that the leak was related to Mishik [sarcastic].

Now they spread misinformation that ""Pashinyan isolated all diplomats, nobody knows about details."" Everyone relevant knows about everything. 

The Security Council held a discussion about the document and a statement was made. Why did we not give details at the time that we were discussing that document? Because that would not be diplomatically serious. It's still in progress. Are we supposed to share the document that we have just received?

This document may never be signed at all. It's possible we will amend this document during discussions. Why upload it while it's still being discussed? Do you understand what we are talking about?

Mishik should have leaked his father's [Serj Sargsyan] documents about giving away Artsakh's 7 regions to Azerbaijan.

**LHK leader Marukyan:** any signature by the Premier about borders would need to be approved by the Parliament. 

**Pashinyan:** statements do not require Parliamentary approval, but the official certification of delimitation/demarcation results is another topic. Now you know the parts [of the document] that were blacked out. Tell me where the ""treason"" is.

**Security Council Chief Grigoryan:** Russia presented the document and we confirmed yesterday that we received it, but we will only discuss it after Azeris withdraw from Armenia. We acted maximally transparently. 

We haven't even begun negotiations over this document because we want Azeris to withdraw first. This is why there was no official statement about negotiations earlier.

We launched an international process and secured a clear consensus [about Azeri withdrawal]. Some Armenian circles did not like our success. They don't like seeing us being able to resolve things diplomatically. 

These events are attempts to meddle with the election process. The more we get closer to a peaceful resolution, the more attempts are made to derail the process.

But if we can't resolve this diplomatically, we reserve the right to apply force.

##anti-corruption: Kocharyan's aide Armen Gevorgyan is charged with $9m laundering

Gevorgyan and Kocharyan are going through a multi-million dollar bribery trial involving a mining businesswoman who testified. This is a separate story.

**Investigators said:** between 2004-2018, the former deputy Premier Armen Gevorgyan laundered and legalized ֏4.9b ($9.4m).

Between 2002-2018, Gevorgyan and his associates had  ֏743m in legal income but Gevorgyan's 39 properties were registered under different names and laundered.

Gevorgyan also abused his powers to pressure mayors of various settlements to organize fake auctions to give away lands to his friends. As a result, the lands were sold at a 6x lower price than the actual price. 

Gevorgyan's associates also registered 10 properties in Czechia, worth $920k. It was revealed that Gevorgyan and friends founded several companies in Czechia to register the properties under their names. The funds circulated by them greatly exceeded their income. //

Gevorgyan maintains innocence. His lawyer said this case was launched on Apr/16/2020 regarding properties owned by Gevorgyan's family members, but Gevorgyan denies connection with the properties.

##IRS to refund overpayments automatically by eliminating a step 

The government approved amendments to how IRS repays over-collected funds. 

Right now you have to file two applications to transfer funds from one account to another. The reforms will save time by eliminating one of the steps.

There are 36k taxpayers who overpaid ֏4.5b. 89% of them are expecting under ֏100km in refunds.

**Pashinyan:** We consider one of our most important successes the fact that the state has repaid the debts of taxpayers by taking huge steps. In our effort to bring the government's debt to taxpayers to zero, we attempted to learn what the remaining balances are and found that 4.5 billion was left hanging.

With today's decision, 35k businesses will receive refunds applied to their accounts. The refunds can be used either to cover their existing debt or to get a physical cheque.

5/7/2022,The Motive,"Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Nikol Pashinyan believe(d) that our sole obstacle to have peace with Turkey and Azerbaijan is the Karabakh question. Their reasoning is that: if we can solve this issue by any means then this will result into great development for the future well being of Armenia (this is beyond insane considering that Azeris and Turks already have their eyes on Syunik). Nikol has learned from the mistakes of Levon in 1997 and prepared himself better in the execution of handing over Artsakh to Azerbaijan (preparing the public mentally for this event and orchestrating a war which we supposedely couldnt win - under the guise of ""mismanagement"" and not that the loss of land was coördinated a retreat and sabotage). These are the following steps, motivations and eventual endgoals of the LTP and Nikol block which was prepared for years before they came again in power in 2018 by public manipulation.

1. Open borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan will bring new logistic and economic possibilities

2. Economic and social connections with Turkey and Azerbaijan will improve commerce and bring more wealth to Armenia

3. If there is no military threat from Turkey and Azerbaijan anymore, then there is no need for Russian protection

4. If there is no need for Russian protection then Armenia can remove their base from Gyumri and start to focus on EU and NATO coöperation

5. Endgoal: be like Georgia and Ukraine (even if this means that there is a significant chance that Turkey and Azerbaijan will use this opportunity to annex Armenia - The West wouldn't mind this and will never prioritize the existence of Armenia above their relation with Turks, any other scenario from harmful groups like Sasna Tzrer/Azgayin Bever is delusional - the only interest the West has in Armenia, is removing Russian influence from the Caucasus region).

If you have time, then search political comments of Nikol and his early writings (like his book from 2008) that can confirm this vision.

The problem is that the current government is also full of Western funded ""preperation for peace"" traitors who have a Western-Eurocentric humanist liberal mindset that can't comprehend the actual socio-cultural reality (most people who voted for Nikol are politically too illiterate to understand what this party actually stands for) + evident historic expansionist goals of the Turks. They believe that the globalist order and the international community (West-Europe + USA) will save Armenia if we ditch Russia, become diplomatically more close to West, have a liberal government and Westernize our culture to become more like the white liberal Ubermenschen which they worship (we all have seen how disastrous their social changes turned out to be). They don't care about the beauty, the honour and the essential traditional elements of our culture which are inseparable parts of our Armenian family life and community.

Also keep in mind how millions have been spend on the slander campaign against the administrations of Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan - which Turkey and NATO saw as an obstacle to establish their soft power in Armenia. It's not easy to undo years of propaganda and foreign funded media (CivilNet, Azatutyun, EVN Report etc.) and restore the public opinion. Their influence is so strong that even citizens who are against Nikol Pashinyan still use his spreaded narratives to not support the opposition.

These people are dangerous, reckless and will wilfully do anything to finalize their ideologic program (no matter if this costs us even more Armenian lives and/or land). If Armenians in Armenia are smart enough to realize this then they need to get rid of these traitor elements from our government ASAP before it's too late!"

Russia might militarily demand that there military passes through Georgia wich may dragg us into the war and beacouse of the propaganda Armenia will support them fully and we will be fighting a 2 front full on war.
2/9/2017,What is this sub turning to?,"So seems like the mods want to turn this sub into a hub for Azerbaijani and Turkish propaganda. Instead of coming to read news or articles related to Armenia, I have to react to idiotic posts or videos presumably depicting the killing of our soldiers. What is next? Videos of beheadings? If this is where we going to, I will unsubscribe from this sub and stop posting here. I don't think it is very hard to get that kind of content removed. What is the point of having them post here anyway? It is not like it creates any type of reasonable discussion, just feeding the bitterness of the sociopaths posting them and pushing their state run propaganda.

##treason in Hadrut and the rear / unit commander worked for Azeris / shared locations of air defense units

**NSS report says:** A former military man with multiple medals and awards joined another citizen and traveled to Turkey under the pretense of finding a job. They were recruited by Azeri intel while in Turkey.

From that point on, the two friends established direct communication with each other to split the duties, the bribes, and to help each other with the crime. They received instructions from Azeri intel.

After the preparatory work, they traveled from Turkey to the third state where they met high-ranking Azeri intel agents to sign a contract and receive specific orders. The agreement was signed in the Azeri embassy in the third state. They agreed to work against Armenia and were given nicknames and prepayments.

**gathering info**

To act in secrecy, they gave the Azeris their phone numbers issued in Turkey and other details about internet apps. They subsequently received orders from Azeris to photograph Armenian military units, the stationed equipment, troop numbers, personal details of commanders, locations of air defense units near important objects.

They also photographed important objects such as water dams, hydros, strategic heights, shelters, troop movements. This was transmitted to Azeris via the phone apps. 

**2020 war begins**

Afterward, when the war began on September 27, in order to carry out the tasks set forth by Azeri intel, one of them registered as a commander of a volunteer military unit and went to Hadrut battlefield and continued to collect and transmit secret info until late October. He took photos and shared other details about air defense units, missiles, positions, etc. 

**southern crack**

This allowed the enemy to pinpoint the location of important military tech to make precision strikes against the tech and personnel. This caused significant damage to the combat effectiveness of Armenian forces and did not allow them to go forward with the plans.

Favorable conditions were created for the enemy to break through the line of defense in the southern direction and further advance into the depths of Artsakh.

**S-300 drone strike?**

One of the agents transmitted photos and other info about the location of a զենիթահրթիռային missile system stationed deep in the rear, which allowed the enemy to use a drone to destroy it. *[the NSS video indicates that this is about the destruction of Armenia's S-300 unit, it's similar to an earlier shared video]*

**they confessed**

The two confessed after being arrested. They asked for leniency [on video]. A dozen raids were conducted in their residences. Communication tools, mobile phones, video recorded by them, and other evidence was found.

[They were promised $20,000 but were only paid $4,500, said one of them on video.]

##electoral campaign enters its final stage / parties to ramp up propaganda

**Electoral Commission:** we wish you all the best of luck. We urge parties and voters to respect the rules and not to insult each other.

**NSS to parties:** we are watching. Play fair. We will find out if you forge documents or distribute bribes.  

**Human Rights Ombudsman:** respect each other and don't use insults to prevent tensions. Knock it off with the fake social media accounts that promote violence. 

**President Sarkissian:** be restrained, respect the voter and opponent. Do not deepen the tensions. Don't use dishonest tools. Law enforcement has special duties to uphold the law. //

The court ruled in favor of Kocharyan to reinstate his personal book's promotional posters after the Electoral Commission earlier found it in violation of campaign rules because it was deemed as electoral propaganda. Critics said the Commission was right for taking down Kocharyan's posters but did not properly clarify ""why"", hence the court verdict siding with Kocharyan. One NGO believes the Commission intentionally left a ""loophole"" by not clarifying its stance in court.

##Levon Ter-Petrosyan has a couple of things to say

**Levon about Armenia's allies:** Armenia does not have allies in the Karabakh conflict. The public and most political forces have not yet grasped this because of the propaganda in the past 30 years. I wrote 25 years ago that Armenia does not have an ally in the Karabakh conflict. 

Now some claim that if not Russia then the US, Iran, or China will be the ally. That means we don't want to take lessons from our old and recent histories. We made a mistake 100 years ago, but 70 years of Soviet times have passed, the Karabakh Movement learned from old mistakes and secured victories in the 90s. Sadly, we could make the old mistakes again.

**Levon's message to teammates:** Be calm and coldhearted. Don't escalate arguments with opponents regardless of what they say. Your arguments are more powerful. Let them say ""քաչալ շուն"" all they want.

There will be public debates participated by us. Journalists will try to provoke you but do not fall for it. Say what you have to say calmly. I will give a press conference. They can bombard me all they want. I'm not afraid of bombardmen if this is the army we have.

**Levon's party:** we should switch to a semi-presidential system. The parliamentary system doesn't work for countries like ours; we are at war. The parliamentary system is unable to resolve the issues we face today. A semi-presidential system is necessary so that the commander-in-chief can make rapid decisions. The parliamentary system does not allow for this to happen.

##Kocharyan also supports unblocking regional trade routes

**Kocharyan in Agarak:** we support unblocking communication routes but we are against a ""corridor"". The [1999 Meghri corridor](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/nqtnm4/jun22021_1_kocharyans_corridor_document/) accusations against me are propaganda. Do not believe in lies. Those who accuse me are the ones discussing the Meghri corridor... It would not be normal for us to be against railway and road communication. 

**Kocharyan about roads:** we should have launched the North-South highway project not from Ararat valley but from Syunik: the most difficult area.  

**Kocharyan about negotiations:** the right way to negotiate is not to give hope and not to take it away. This administration said they would turn Shushi into capital, thus depriving Azerbaijan of hope that they could achieve something diplomatically. By doing so, they provoked a confrontation. *[Pashinyan earlier accused Kocharyan of continuously giving Azeris more and more hope and promises, including Shushi one day being part of Azerbaijan]*

##Pashinyan traveled across Armenia and had a few things to say

**Pashinyan about productivity:** labor productivity is very low in Armenia. The average worker produces $6/hour, twice lower than other EAEU bloc countries, ten times lower than the EU. 

The government should help increase efficiency, for example, through the use of technologies to replace manual work. Farmers should use tech to improve their efficiency.

**Pashinyan about democracy:** The strongest motivation for our participation is that the people should not lose the sense that they own the country. Those who say ""կրելու են"" [Kocharyan] will կրել their punishment instead.

**Pashinyan about ending monopolies:** the number of construction wood importers doubled since 2018 because we ended monopolies. Nobody can stop you from importing or exporting materials today. This wasn't the case before 2018; you had to have special ""connections"". 

**Pashinyan about Armenia's development:** An era for peaceful development can open for Armenia so that the Armenian people can live freely and create in their homeland. But peace is not only external but also internal. The snap elections are meant to secure internal peace. By voting #3 you vote for yourself, against the thieves that conspired against Armenia.

**Pashinyan about education:** in the next 5 years we will build over 300 kindergartens and 300 schools, in addition to what's under construction today. 

**Pashinyan about war casualties:** the death toll is under 4,000. Can you explain why the [former regime] continues to use 5-7,000 numbers? What is the point of adding to the death toll? They became Azerbaijan's lawyers in Armenia. Azeri government can point out and says look, it's Armenians who say that, it's Armenians who say the deaths were a result of Armenians themselves, it's Armenians who provoked and started a war, it's them who committed war crimes. 

The former regime has been acting as Azerbaijan's lawyer since 2021. Meanwhile, we tried to protect the homeland from the disgraceful negotiation process inherited from them. But even during the war they were calling generals and telling them to move the forces to Yerevan for a coup instead. And to this day they continue with their efforts to move the war into Armenia. We must not let this happen. They want to incite civil war. Vote against that on June 20.

**Infrastructure Minister:** the former regime hired a couple of ""journalists"" to travel across Armenia and film damaged roads to manipulate and prove that we haven't done anything. Didn't we inherit those roads from you? What were you doing for 30 years? The money you collected wasn't for the army, wasn't for the roads, what was it for? 

**Pashinyan responds to Serj's statement that he would have committed suicide if he was in Pashinyan's place:** Serj Sargsyan was the #1 public official tasked with security in 1999 when the despicable October 27 terror attack happened. I don't remember Serj cutting his veins. 

Here is the list of people murdered during Serj's tenure as NSS chief: *Armenia's general prosecutor, the commander of internal forces, commander of police forces, the Prime Minister, the parliament president and deputies, minister, MPs. And? Can you explain why he hasn't shot himself in the head?*

**Pashinyan responds to Kocharyan saying he would rather fight Pashinyan with a weapon (duel) instead of holding a debate:** The situation is sad. He has to take up arms personally because Nairi Hunanyan is in prison [October 27 terrorist].

##Aram Sargsyan does not rule out cooperation with other parties

**Vazgen's brother  Aram (Republic Party):** we only have external enemies. The election results will show the winners and proportions. We were not a supporter of the Parliamentary system. This system requires very fast elections because governments may be unable to form coalitions, or coalitions could fall.

Coalitions will be necessary in our case. That will depend on the number of MPs the parties gain. It's difficult to predict. The enemy is at our doorsteps; we don't rule out cooperation with like-minded parties under such circumstances. 

We must gradually reduce our reliance on Russia because Russia is not our ally. We must diversify our foreign policy.

**Q: is there a chance you could join Kocharyan?**

We have categorically opposite approaches and differences in terms of ideology. The public would not understand such an alliance. //

The Republic party came up with an ""innovative"" idea. Their campaign booths have flyers with the detachable bottom where the residents can write their opinions on what the party should do.

##demographic improvement program gains popularity / housing

Labor Ministry gives housing subsidies to families with children. Applications sharply increased this year. 

**Ministry:** the program launched in July 2020. By the end of the year, there were 414 beneficiaries. This year so far we have 1043 beneficiaries. The program is meant to boost demographics. It has three components:

First. A one-time payment to purchase or build housing in provinces. 

Second. The government subsidizes 90% of the mortgage downpayment insurance costs.

Third. A one-time subsidy to help repay the mortgage when a child is born.

The government increased the 1H21 budget from ֏526m to ֏696 to meet the increased demand. Applicants are mainly from Yerevan, Kotayk, Lori, Ararat, and Syunik. It's not necessary for the family to have multiple children to apply. The number of children affects the size of aid.

From what I gather, they (whoever it may be) would run into 2 obstacles...the Black Sea and/or Iran.

**Black Sea**: if, for example France, decides to send arms to Armenia, is there a zone within the Black Sea that is considered international waters or air space? If that's the case then they could use that via Georgia to get the weapons to Armenia. If not then we have the 2nd obstacle...

**Iranian Airspace:** If the Black Sea (via Georgia) option is not viable, the second way would be through air delivery which means they would need to fly over Iranian airspace to reach Armenia. I'm certain the Iranians would not want a NATO member using its airspace to deliver its weapons to a neighboring country.

Am I missing something here? Russia won't allow it. Turkey won't allow it. Azerbaijan obviously won't allow it. The Georgians will do as the EU/US says but when it comes to the Iranians...I just don't know.

Again, as things stand, it's a pipe-dream to even imagine Armenia receiving 1/100th of the support Ukraine is from the West. But this is just a question I had this morning that I'd like to discuss with you guys. "

He spoke about Armenia's recent steps to ratify the Rome Statute and the September decision by the Armenian parliament to ratify Protocol N. 13 on Abolition of Death Penalty in All Circumstances (Council of Europe Convention). 

##... about democracy 

**PASHINYAN:** Armenia is going through difficult trials, and so is democracy in Armenia and around the world. It raises the question: is democracy able to provide security and happiness? 

I didn't come here to ask, I came here to answer: ""Yes"". If it wasn't for democracy, Armenia would have lost its sovereignty and would have been paralyzed after the 2020 war. The democratically formed institutions stood firm despite the attacks by extremist groups. 

##... accuses Russia of total inaction and conspiring with Azerbaijan to subvert Armenia's democracy

**PASHINYAN:** On 12 May 2021, Azerbaijani troops invaded 4 kilometers deep into our territory. The CSTO and [Russia], despite bilateral security obligations, did not help us at all.

This invasion took place shortly before the parliamentary elections. The goal was to paralyze our statehood and form a puppet government. 

There have been multiple similar events. There is a pattern: Azerbaijan attacks, [Russia] displays inaction, then there are attempts to use the difficult situation to subvert our democracy and sovereignty under the direction of external forces [Russia].

But in this environment, the people of Armenia were able to stand firm in defense of our independence and democracy.

##... accuses Russian peacekeepers of allowing Azerbaijan to carry out ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh, then attempting to overthrow the government in Armenia, while the World stood by and watched

**PASHINYAN:** Azerbaijan, fulfilling its long-standing policy of ethnic cleansing, carried out a large-scale attack on Nagorno-Karabakh. At the time when hundreds of thousands of Armenians fled to Armenia, our allies in the security sector [Russia] not only did not help us, but also made public calls for a change of power in Armenia, to overthrow the democratic government.

Despite hundreds of alarms and decisions by the World Court, EP, and PACE, we were unable to prevent the ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh. We have urged the UN, OSCE, and EU to send fact-finding missions to the illegally blocked Lachin Corridor and Nagorno-Karabakh, but no organization made a relevant decision.

We initiated three discussions related to the issue in the UN Security Council, but the discussions did not have any practical results and here, Nagorno Karabakh is already depopulated. 

In the conditions of inactivity of the Russian peacekeeping force, more than 100,000 Armenians left their homeland Nagorno-Karabakh within a week, while another 20,000 were forced to abandon their homes immediately after the 2020 war.

And today some pretend they do not understand why the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh left their homes en masse. This is cynicism in itself because the answer is more than clear. Azerbaijan clearly demonstrated its decision to make the life of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh impossible.

Since December 2022, during the period of the illegal blockade of the Lachin Corridor, the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh have been deprived of external supplies of gas, electricity, fuel, food, baby food, medicine, hygienic and other essential goods, while civilians engaged in agricultural work have been targeted by the Azerbaijani armed forces.

##... Azerbaijan's plan against Nagorno-Karabakh

**PASHINYAN:** Since December 2022, we have alerted dozens of times about Azerbaijan's plan: close the Lachin Corridor, starve people, increase military, informational, and psychological pressure, then open the Lachin Corridor, forcing all Armenians to leave.

We warned loudly and publicly, so I do not accept the surprised faces of some international officials over the depopulation of Nagorno-Karabakh that took place in September.

I must thank the European Parliament for naming what happened in Nagorno-Karabakh by its name. This is important in terms of protecting the future rights of people who have been deprived of their motherland.

##... Azerbaijan's plan against Armenia, regional communication routes, enclaves

**PASHINYAN:** Following multiple meetings hosted by Europe, I reaffirmed several times that Armenia recognizes the territorial integrity of 86,600 km^2 of Azerbaijan, but the President of Azerbaijan never made such a statement. Recently, he announced that he recognizes the territorial integrity of Armenia, but did not mention 29,800 km^2, which raises concerns that he is deliberately leaving ambiguities to bring forward territorial claims against Armenia. 

The next principle of peace and normalization is border delimitation based on the most recent USSR maps that have been provided to the sides, which should also be a basis for the distancing of forces, and for finalizing the peace treaty and addressing all humanitarian issues.

But Azerbaijan declares that there is no border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which contradicts the Almaty declaration and the other agreements. Azerbaijan also maintains ambiguities in accepting the latest maps of the USSR as a basis for delimitation, which also gives some experts a reason to assume that Azerbaijan is preparing grounds for making territorial claims against Armenia and initiating a new military aggression.

Additionally, Azerbaijan continuously insists that Armenia is obliged to give Azerbaijan a corridor through its own territory. In everyday international parlance that you are familiar with, the word corridor simply means interstate roads. But there is a peculiarity in the case of our region. 
In the Nov. 9 Tripartite Statement, the word ""corridor"" is used only for the Lachin Corridor, which was supposed to connect Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The peculiarity is that according to that document, the Lachin Corridor is not just a road, but also a 5-kilometer-wide territory, which should have been outside the control of Azerbaijan, under the control of peacekeepers. Therefore, in this context, the word corridor has the meaning of an extraterritorial layer. Armenia has never agreed to give any extraterritorial layers to Azerbaijan.

Armenia and Azerbaijan should open their roads for each other without the above-mentioned corridor logic. At the checkpoints of those roads, border and other relevant control services should operate, based on the jurisdiction of the countries. This should be done based on the principle of reciprocity. 

We are ready to restore the Meghri railway, which will connect Armenia's north to south, Azerbaijan's east to west, and will serve as a hub to connect other countries. We called this project the ""Armenian Crossroads"". But I think it's time to rebrand it and call it ""Crossroads of Peace"". Armenia is ready to ensure the safety of cargo, vehicles, people, pipelines, and electric lines in its territory.

We want the 30-year-long blockade to be lifted. There is no reason to accuse Armenia of obstructing the opening of transport communications. However, there are analyses that official Baku is manipulating the narrative of corridor to provoke a new war, to occupy new territories of Armenia, or to keep Armenia under blockade. This should not be allowed. 

Armenia is ready to facilitate procedures to ensure the safety of the passage of Azerbaijani goods and persons through Armenia, hoping for reciprocity as well, we are ready for a simultaneous withdrawal of troops from the 1991 border line, which will mean that Azerbaijan will not have troops in any territory of Armenia, and Armenia will not have troops in Azerbaijan. 

We are ready to address the issue of the so-called enclaves on the principle of reciprocity.

##... about peace treaty and humanitarian gestures 
 
And finally, we are ready to sign a peace treaty with Azerbaijan by the end of 2023. It is unfortunate that Azerbaijan did not attend the Granada meeting. But we have an agreement to hold a tripartite meeting in Brussels soon, and if the above-mentioned principles are officially reaffirmed, signing a peace agreement by the end of the year will become very realistic.

Armenia is ready to release all prisoners, captives, and detained persons, in the principle “all for all”, and we are also ready to cooperate closely in clarifying the fate of the missing persons. 1,016 citizens of Armenia are currently considered missing. 

We are ready to cooperate in demining. In 2021 Armenia received from Nagorno-Karabakh and transferred to Azerbaijan all the maps of minefields at the disposal of the Armenian side. We did this without preconditions, as an expression of goodwill, but, unfortunately, Azerbaijan perceived it not as a step towards peace, but as an opportunity to intensify aggressive rhetoric towards Armenia. 

But in spite of all this, we must move steadily towards peace. To do this, political will is necessary. I and the Armenian government have that political will. I have to ask for the EU's continued attention and support to implement the aforementioned principles.

##... economic cooperation with Europe; Armenia wants to strengthen relations with the EU without limits

Pashinyan spoke about the CEPA agreement, AM-EU economic programs, police and other reforms. 

**PASHINYAN:** It is extremely important to give new momentum to the programs implemented under the EU Economic and Investment Plan.
Within the framework of the Plan, projects worth more than 400 million euros have already been launched, implemented with various financial instruments, of which around 270 million euros are for access of SME to finance, around 34 million euros are for technological development, around 43 million euros are for increasing the resilience of Syunik [sothern province], and around 62 million euros are for the green development of Yerevan.

I am happy to emphasize that this is not all. On October 5 of this year, two extremely important documents for EU-Armenia relations were adopted in Granada. Both statements support the strengthening of EU-Armenia relations in all dimensions based on the needs of Armenia. We are committed to further strengthening EU-Armenia relations. 

Armenia is ready to be closer to the EU, as much as the EU considers it possible. Our joint statement with President von der Leyen reads: ""In these difficult times, the EU and Armenia stand shoulder to shoulder.""
 
Let us continue to stand shoulder to shoulder in our commitment to make the times better. I am convinced that democracy can provide peace and prosperity. Let's prove this together. Long live democracy! Thank you. //

##interview with military expert Leonid Nersisyan 

**REPORTER:** The events since 2020 have made us realize that relying on Russia and Russian weapons was a mistake. Is there an alternative?

**LEONID:** There is an alternative, and Armenia has already signed contracts with India worth almost $1 billion. 

We had no issues with importing Russian weapons prior to 2020, but our biggest shortcoming during the war was organizational in nature. Knowledge and implementation are just as important as the types of weapons you buy. Buying weapons is 30%-40% of the task.
We need to train officers who can use the new weapons.

Military education has been very problematic in Armenia in the past 30 years. The sense of prestige associated with graduating from Vazgen Sargsyan University came to an end about 10-15 years ago. Few people applied and it became very easy to get in. There was a lack of quality educational programs and enough dedicated applicants who wanted to become officers. This is difficult to reform when the problem has existed for several decades, but there is no other option.   

Armenian military and its structure were stuck in the 1980s. Today we do have a limited number of experts capable of reforming this but many of them are not part of the army today, or they weren't allowed to display their skills during their active duty. The government must make a political decision to change this. 

**REPORTER:** Is it possible to switch from the USSR to the NATO model?

**LEONID:** That's a primitive way of looking at things. Of course we should adopt the majority of concepts from NATO, but let's not forget that Armenia has its own theater of events, terrain, weather, and resources with their respective peculiarities. You can't simply bring the American doctrine here.

**REPORTER:** But NATO has countries that share similarities with Armenia. 

**LEONID:** You still have to convert and make it Armenian. This is why we need skilled officers who can manage through this. Since we don't have much time to train ours, right now we could involve the paid consultancy of foreign military experts. They could be retired officers from NATO states. 

**REPORTER:** France has already agreed.

**LEONID:** France has agreed at a state level to provide this type of support. But if you want British expertise, for example, you'd need to sign private deals with individual officers who retired not long ago. 

**REPORTER:** Should Armenia switch from conscription to exclusively contractor-based military service?

**LEONID:** No. Quantity is still important. Today our borders are vulnerable because we don't have the necessary 80,000 soldiers to guard them. For now, we must keep conscripts but increase the share of professional contractors. If for example, we have 45,000 conscripts, we could hire another 35,000 professional contractors. We could use the conscripts to defend trenches or the rear, the simplest tasks, while the contractors could take care of counterattacks and mobile activities. During the 2020 war, our conscripts were better trained than the contractors. It was absurd.

##interview with military expert Vova Vartanov 

**REPORTER:** Why did Russian peacekeepers and the Kremlin allow the September 19 attack to happen? Do you have an explanation?

**VOVA:** I do. In 1992, shortly before the liberation of Shushi, [army commander] Vazgen Sargsyan ordered me to distract the Azerbaijani army by launching an offensive toward Mt. Odundagh [northeast, Tavush]. I named the operation plainly ""Odundagh"". It's dumb when the title of your operation describes its details. Anyways, the operation was successful and we were able to distract the opponent.

After the liberation of Shushi, we were alerted that Azeris were preparing a large-scale offensive. By using our informants in the USSR we learned that the Russian 104th desantnik division located in Ganja, led by Col.Gen. Selivanov, was preparing an operation on behalf of Azeris. In the Russian 104th division's training base, Russians were training 5,000 Azeris for the counteroffensive after our liberation of Ivanyan and Shushi. 

As the officer tasked with collecting the intel, I reported it to Vazgen Sargsyan. Never in my dreams would I ever imagine that the Russian army itself would get involved and help Azeris to that degree. 

Russia had even brought its 60th artillery division from Ilichevsk [Lenkoran] to bombard the Lachin corridor. Russia's 23rd motorized division was assaulting Martakert, Shahumyan, and Askeran regions.

I admit, at the time I did not believe that Russia could be THAT shortsighted and idiotic. Today Russia is shamefully losing its reputation around the world. They are appeasing Turkey and Azerbaijan by downplaying the assassination of their ambassador and the downing of their jets and helicopters, and more recently the murder of their peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia invaded Georgia after the death of a few peacekeepers in 2008 but didn't do anything against Azerbaijan despite having warned about ""consequences"" in the event of physical harm to peacekeepers. 

**REPORTER:** What are you up to these days? 

**VOVA:** VOMA is training volunteers with first aid skills, mountainous and urban warfare. We also build fortified structures on borders. Israel with its advanced weapons was unable to bring Hezbollah to its knees in 2006 because Hezbollah had built ground fortifications. If I wasn't an idiot, I would have initiated our fortification project 30 years ago.

In addition to these fortifications, we must pay attention to how we transport troops. Instead of having 40 soldiers in one large truck, they must move in 20 vehicles. These vehicles and ammo storages must be kept in hidden storages, in different locations. Two of the Armenian battalions in Qarvachar [mountinous area, northwest Karabakh] had no winter clothes because their centralized storages were destroyed. VOMA was able to assist and equip one battalion only. This is why it's necessary to decentralize.

**REPORTER:** How are you building these fortifications?

**VOVA:** Without disclosing secrets, I can give you a description of the construction process. At first, we build the ""boiler room"", then lengthy work on the metal framework, tie the apalovka, pour the concrete and use a vibrator to strengthen the concrete, remove the apalovka, and add soil on top. It's a long process but the quality makes it worth it. It underwent trials at the Defense Ministry's test ground. They bombed the shit out of it. The results were positive.

**REPORTER:** What weapons can we expect from France?

**VOVA:** Defensive weapons, air defense, radio-electronic. I don't think we should get communication systems from France because we can find cheaper alternatives elsewhere that are equally as good. France has one of the best air defense and radio-electronic weapons, and it's reflected in the price.

Making a full transition to French air defense would be wrong because we currently possess other solutions. We actually have a lot of weapons left today. Part of our existing inventory needs modernization but Russia is too busy and can't do it. We need the French air defense and radio-electronic weapons to supplement and adapt to your system.

France also has sensors that detect the location of the enemy's firing position. Our local manufacturers also have similar solutions. 

Our *very good friend*, a secretary who works at the French embassy, has told us that France is offering a very good catalog of weapons. The previous secretary was only saying ""France is ready to discuss it"" because there were some barriers at the time. Today those barriers no longer exist and France has made a political decision to deliver the weapons. 

**REPORTER:** We will end up having a mixture of Russian, Indian, and French weapons. Can we incorporate them into one system?

**VOVA:** It's a difficult task but Armenian manufacturers have come up with a solution. The company Instigate Robotics has established a Control Center. It is tasked with adapting various weapons that do not know how to communicate with each other out of the factory. The Center is in the trial phase. It's a daunting task to navigate through our super-duper-bureaucratic system.

Our problem is somewhere else. We have an imbecilic habit of training only 1-2 people to control a new weapon. We often find ourselves having to bring ""naladchiks"" from abroad to fix our new weapons. What if the naladchik doesn't come? Your shiny weapon will collect dust. 

They have a funny situation in a superpower called Russia. They can't even fly the jets properly without accidents because they no longer have access to naladchiks from Boeing or Airbus. 

One of our boys purchased a very good sniper rifle but he can't maintain his certification because bullets cost $20 so he can't afford to train constantly. My point is that you need to create a sustainable environment around your new weapon.

##Bulgaria takes a poo-poo on Serbia and Hungary

2022 April: Russia ends gas delivery to Bulgaria after its refusal to pay in rubles. Bulgaria's territory is still used to transfer gas to Hungary and Serbia.

2023 October: Bulgaria jacks up the price for transferring gas through its territory. Hungary and Serbia will have to pay an additional €100 per cubic meter.

**SERBIA:** That's too high. Let's negotiate. 

**BULGARIA:** Our territory, our fees. Look for an alternative if you don't like it.

**HUNGARY:** These fees are unacceptable and threaten European solidarity. Just yesterday we got hit with a price hike on oil transit through Ukraine, and now you?

**BULGARIA:** This price hike will generate additional €1.2 billion per year. It will pay off the construction of our Balkan Stream gas pipeline [east-west] in just one year.

**EXPERT:** The fee hike might not have the intended effect because it's impossible to obtain a certificate of origin for gas transported through a pipeline because it is a mixture of several sources. Such a fee may be imposed on liquefied gas transported by tankers but not on the pipeline mix.

""The Court observed that, since 12 December 2022, the connection between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia via the Lachin Corridor has been disrupted. The Court notes that a number of consequences have resulted from this situation and that the impact on those affected persists to this date""

“The information available to the Court indicates that the disruption on the Lachin Corridor has impeded the transfer of persons of Armenian national or ethnic origin hospitalized in Nagorno-Karabakh to medical facilities in Armenia for urgent medical care. The evidence also indicates that there have been hindrances to the importation into Nagorno-Karabakh of essential goods, causing shortages of food, medicine and other life-saving medical supplies,” the ruling reads.""

""The Court noted that the Trilateral Statement of December 9, 2020, provides, inter alia, that the Lachin Corridor, “which will provide a connection between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia . . . shall remain under the control of the Russian Federation peacemaking forces”. It recalled that the Statement further states that “Azerbaijan shall guarantee the security of persons, vehicles and cargo moving along the Lachin Corridor in both directions”.

11/4/2022,A question about military service in Armenia,"Please don’t hate me for this question.
I am a citizen of Russia. I live in Russia my whole life but i want to move to Armenia in the future (in 1-3 years) or at least be able to travel there but there is one problem. I have just turned 18 and i had Armenian citizenship when i was a kid, it expired when i was maybe 6 years old and we never recovered it. I can’t go to Armenia now because I am not willing to go through the 2 year military service and possibly die at war in Karabakh some day. I know i might sound like a douche bag but i hope most of you will understand me.
Some say that nothing is going to happen because my citizenship has expired, others say i might get caught there and be forced to go through the military service (i know by fact that the military commissar of my area has information about me and i might be in the database).
I’ve also heard that its possible to “buy your way out” for some $20.000 

I really want to go to Armenia. 

Would be very grateful if those who know about this could help me with my problem"

#February 20, 1988 will remain in Armenian history as a symbol of national awakening, unity and liberation struggle – PM Pashinyan

“The movement was the first step in the restoration of our statehood, by which we regained the determination to live freely and independently, shape our destiny and manage our future,” the Prime Minister said.

He noted that the Karabakh movement was to express the right and will of the people of Artsakh to defend their rights and live a dignified life on their own land.

“Even after 35 years, the Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh are facing serious challenges. Even today, being under siege, our compatriots are forced to express their will to protect their rights and security. As I have mentioned many times, these actions of Azerbaijan have one goal: to break the will of the people of Nagorno Karabakh to live in their homeland, which, however, I am sure, is unbreakable and unshakable,” PM Pashinyan stated.

“We continue to multiply our efforts to focus international attention on the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh, because only the unabated activity of the international community can curb Azerbaijan’s aggressiveness and provocative actions, fully implement the commitments made in the tripartite dstatement of November 9, 2020, and unblock the Lachin Corridor,” he continued.

“At the same time, we will continue our consistent steps aimed at solving the socio-economic problems of Artsakh Armenians, overcoming security challenges, forming mechanisms for protecting the rights and security of Artsakh Armenians. The realization of these goals requires unceasing work and we must be steadfast in that work,” PM Pashinyan noted.

Addressing the people of Artsakh, the Prime Minister said: “Be strong and unbreakable for the sake of living and creating peacefully and safely in the homeland. Facing the new global and regional challenges, we must focus our efforts on the implementation of the peace agenda, although we understand the complications and problems that await us along the way. By and large, a peaceful, dignified and safe life has been the substantive goal of the Karabakh movement, and we must move towards that goal.”

Our decision remains unchanged, our spirit unbroken, our path unwavering, President says on Artsakh Revival Day

“On that very day, the special session of the Regional Council of the NKAO, held in Stepanakert, adopted a historic decision, that gave a legal effect to the decades-long struggle of Artsakh Armenians for the protection of their rights, freedoms and national dignity. We declared our resolute and unshakable will to live freely and independently on our native soil, to master our destiny on our own,” the President said.""

“Even after 35 years, our decision remains unchanged, our spirit unbroken, our path unwavering. The people of Artsakh who have been under blockade for more than two months now, have proved with their endurance and determination once again that they are the masters of the decision they have made, the master of the path they have chosen and the land of their ancestors, which has always been and should be Armenian,” he added.""

“We are deeply grateful to all those who are with us on this difficult path, to all our compatriots in Mother Armenia and the Diaspora, to the true friends of Artsakh in different parts of the world, who, with the support they render, give us inexhaustible strength in our struggle for the protection of universal values, fundamental norms and principles of democracy,” Arayik Harutyunyan said.""

“I bow my head before the bright memory of all those who gave their lives for the holy cause of defending the Motherland. They are always with us, next to us and lead us along the path of building the future of Artsakh. We must do everything to make the cherished dreams and goals of our heroes come true,” he continued.""

“May God grant our people peace, strength and vigor, strong faith and hope, so that we can overcome all trials with dignity and fulfill our national goals and aspirations!” the President concluded.""

#Our will to keep Artsakh Armenian remains unshakable – Ruben Vardanyan

“The preservation of Artsakh and the feeling of victory in the first Artsakh war gave us great strength and confidence, because we managed to make that victory, which seemed impossible to many, possible. Thanks to the movement, we realized that we can prevent the catastrophe of losing our homeland through struggle,” Vardanyan said.""

“The people of Artsakh continue to fight for the right to live a free, independent, dignified life, so that the threat of ethnic cleansing and deportation from the homeland does not hang over our heads. In response to that, we received wars, loss of life and difficult trials from neighboring Azerbaijan, which continue in the form of today’s blockade and the difficulties imposed on us,” the State Minister said.""

“Despite all the trials, our will to keep Artsakh Armenian remains unshakable. All those who discuss and try to decide the fate of Artsakh without us do not understand that we took our fate into our own hands 35 years ago on this day. We paid a very high price for that decision. Many of our devoted heroes gave their lives to keep this land Armenian, because they understood the exceptional importance of Artsakh for the preservation of Armenian statehood and the Armenian world,” he continued.""

“During these 100 days of my tenure as the Minister of State and in the situation of heavy siege, I saw for myself the extraordinarily powerful strength of the people of Artsakh and realized that we get that strength from the land we live on, where the roots of our national identity are. I felt the depth of our roots and that unique power that comes from it,” Ruben Vardanyan said.""

“And now I confidently say that even if it takes another 35 years to reach our goal, it should not stop us, disappoint us, or take us away from our goal. We have enough will and persistence to achieve our goal and no one can take that away from us,” the State Ministrer concluded.""

#The people of Artsakh continue their struggle for their independent existence in the historical homeland. MFA of Artsakh

""The MFA of the Republic of Artsakh issued a statement on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the Karabakh movement, the national liberation struggle of Artsakh Armenians.""

""The statement says:""

""The Republic of Artsakh (the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh) today celebrates the 35th anniversary of the national liberation struggle of the Artsakh Armenians, the current stage of the Karabakh movement. a struggle that embodied the collective aspiration of the people to restore historical justice, to preserve national identity and dignity, to fully realize their inalienable right to live and develop freely in their homeland. In response to the decades-long discriminatory policy of Azerbaijan, the people of Artsakh gathered all their will and united for the idea of ​​revival of Artsakh and reunification with Armenia.""

""35 years ago, on February 20, 1988, an extraordinary session of the Nagorno-Karabakh Council of People's Deputies took place, in which a decision was made to submit a petition to the Supreme Councils of the Azerbaijan SSR and the Armenian SSR regarding the transfer of the autonomous region from Azerbaijan to Armenia.""

""The issue of Nagorno Karabakh joining Armenia was raised in a democratic, parliamentary manner, based on the will of the people, in strict accordance with the legislation of the USSR and universally recognized norms of international law at that time.""

""The decision of the session, which reaffirmed the right of the people of Artsakh to determine their own destiny, marked the current stage of the Karabakh movement and predetermined the prospects of social and political development of Nagorno Karabakh. In fact, it became in 1991 in the new historical and political realities caused by the collapse of the USSR. the forerunner of the NKR independence declaration adopted on September 2 and started the path of Artsakh state independence.""

""That act of popular expression of the people of Artsakh was rightly considered as a reliable guarantee to be saved from the discriminatory policy carried out by Azerbaijan towards the ethnic Armenian population for decades, which should eventually lead to its complete destruction. Subsequent events confirmed the regularity and truthfulness of the historical choice of the people of Artsakh. Just one week after the session of the regional council, the Azerbaijani authorities organized brutal massacres and murders of Armenians in Sumgait and other cities of Azerbaijan, and after the collapse of the USSR, unleashed a full-scale war against Artsakh.""

""Even decades later, the criminal policy of the official Baku aimed at destroying the people of Artsakh has not changed. This is evidenced by the military aggressions of 2016 and 2020, the ongoing state terrorism against the people of Artsakh, the transportation and energy blockade of the republic that has been going on for almost three months.""

""Despite incredible difficulties and trials, the people of Artsakh continue their struggle for their free and independent existence in the historical homeland, thus realizing the right of peoples to self-determination stipulated by international law, including the UN Charter. The past 35 years have clearly shown that the most important condition for solving national problems is national unity, the consolidation of the moral and spiritual forces of Armenia, Artsakh and the Diaspora, which makes it possible to face the most serious challenges of the time.""

""With the long-term struggle for national dignity and the right to freely manage one's own destiny in the historical homeland, as well as with the creation of a democratic and viable state, the people of Artsakh proved that they deserve the recognition of their independence by the international community.""

""On this memorable day, we bow to the memory of all those who sacrificed their lives for the freedom and independence of Artsakh, for universal ideals and values.""

#Revealed: Leaked document shows how Russia plans to take over Belarus (This is what they want to do with Armenia)

""By 2025, the strategy document states, there need to be “sustainable pro-Russian groups of influence in Belarusian politics, military and business.” It also advocates the expansion of Russian military presence in Belarus and the introduction of a simplified procedure for issuing Russian passports to Belarusian citizens.""

""By 2030, the strategy document states, Russia must have “control of the information space” and must establish “a single cultural space” and “common approach to the interpretation of history” in Belarus. One key deliverable in this realm is the predominance of the Russian language over Belarusian — something already largely in place. Russian is enshrined in the Belarusian constitution as one of two state languages. According to a 2019 census, more than 60% of Belarusians claimed Belarusian as their native tongue, but more than 70% of the country indicated that they also speak Russian at home.""

“Regrettably, this is not the first time we see that the European Union is sparing no efforts to win a foothold in our allied Armenia. We see solely political motives, which are far from the interests of real normalization of relations in the South Caucasus. It is sparing no effort to squeeze Russia out of the region and weaken its historical role as a key security guarantor. Baku’s openly voiced negative views about this initiative are being ignored,” she said, commenting on the deployment of the EU civilian mission to Armenia.""

""According to Zakharova, “the European Unions’ record of settling regional conflicts is quite dubious.” “I don’t think Brussels can boast any achievements in this field. Enough to recall the European Union’s mediatory efforts and its mission in Kosovo,” she noted.""

""She stressed that a key factor of stability and security in the region in the foreseeable perspective is the package of agreements between the Russian, Azerbaijani and Armenian leaders. “The shortest way to improve the situation in the region lies via the comprehensive implementation of these agreements, including the unblocking of transport communication, the delimitation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, establishment of ties between peoples, experts, religious circles, parliamentarians of the two countries, and through peace treaty talks.

I am relieved that the EU mission to Armenia is being deployed and can have a positive role to reassure civilian populations. Prisoners of war must all be returned to their homeland and the fate of missing persons must be fully disclosed, I would add the necessity to fully preserve and protect the cultural heritage of the region.""

10/14/2023,For The First Time In Almost 23 Years - The United States Has Banned Military Support To Azerbaijan,"For those unaware, Section 907 is a permanent act (implemented in 1992) that bans military support to Azerbaijan by the United States. It is permanent law in America because of the Armenian American diaspora who advocated for it to happen back in the 90's.

The only way for Section 907 to be waived, is for the president himself to do so every year. Since the terrorist attack on 9/11, every president since 2001 has waived the act and provided Azerbaijan with military support.

Antony Blinken (US Secretary of State) has now confirmed that President Biden has decided not to waive Section 907 - thus a ban on US military support to Azerbaijan will kick in from 2024.

And here is the absolute irony: The United States has just banned military support to Azerbaijan for reclaiming it's own internationally recognized territory by occupier Armenia, whilst the United States has just announced new military aid to occupier Israel to seize even more internationally recognized Palestinian territory.

7/20/2022,Azerbaijan military.,
6/28/2022,The US will continue to provide military assistance to Azerbaijan,"US President Joe Biden has again decided to lift the ban on providing military assistance to Azerbaijan.

Biden's decision, not the first of its kind, adds confidence to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who continues to hold Armenian prisoners, attack Karabakh and remains on the sovereign territory of Armenia.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev says: if revanchists in Armenia raise their heads, they should know what awaits them. On June 27, Aliyev made such a bellicose statement during a speech at a solemn ceremony dedicated to the transfer of the battle banner to the military unit of the special forces in the Kelbajar district of the republic.

""Therefore, we will continue to take serious steps to develop our army. New contracts have been signed for the purchase of the most modern weapons. These contracts are already being fulfilled, new weapons and the most modern equipment are being imported to Azerbaijan and will be imported,"" Aliyev said.

Resolution 907 of the Freedom Support Act prohibits the US government from providing military assistance to Azerbaijan – this becomes possible only if the president circumvents this law and informs Congress about it. This has been done by all US presidents since 2002.

According to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, the export of ammunition to Baku is possible in support of Washington's efforts in the fight against international terrorism, but many experts and politicians are skeptical about the position of the White House. The Azerbaijani authorities, regularly receiving military assistance from the United States or any other EU member state, conceal not only the use of weapons against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, but also their sale to third countries, terrorists or on the black market.

After the 44-day war in 2020, there was a real opportunity to stop this process. As a candidate, Biden called on President Trump to stop providing assistance to Azerbaijan and not to circumvent resolution 907 in the future. However, after becoming president, Biden changed his views in favor of the interests of the American defense industry."
8/15/2023,Why Azerbaijan doesn't destroy legitimate military targets illegally located within sovereign territories of Azerbaijan?,"I find it quite perplexing. Why is Azerbaijan persistently documenting various Armenian military positions, equipment, and vehicles that are unlawfully stationed on Azerbaijani territories, instead of taking action to destroy them? Why should any country tolerate the presence of illegal armed groups that pose a danger to civilians?

Azerbaijan should have issued a clear ultimatum immediately after the war, stating that any illegal military installations would be demolished, and should have followed through with decisive actions."
9/19/2023,Azerbaijan launches military action in the Nagorno-Karabakh region,"*BAKU, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan launched military action in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a step that could presage a new war in the volatile area but which Baku said was necessary to restore constitutional order and drive out Armenian military formations.*

*Karabakh is internationally recognised as Azerbaijani territory but part of it is run by breakaway ethnic Armenian authorities who say the area is their ancestral homeland. It has been at the centre of two wars - the latest in 2020 - since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.*

*Loud and repeated shelling was audible from social media footage filmed in Stepanakert, the capital of Karabakh, called Khankendi by Azerbaijan, on Tuesday.*

*The Karabakh separatist human rights ombudsman, Gegham Stepanyan, said the civilian population had sustained ""multiple casualties"" as a result of strikes by Azerbaijan's military. Reuters could not immediately verify his assertion.*

*In a statement announcing its operation, Azerbaijan's defence ministry spoke of its intention to ""disarm and secure the withdrawal of formations of Armenia’s armed forces from our territories, (and) neutralise their military infrastructure"".*

*It said it was only targeting legitimate military targets using ""high-precision weapons"" and not civilians as part of what it called a drive to ""restore the constitutional order of the Republic of Azerbaijan"".*

*Civilians were free to leave by humanitarian corridors, it added, including one to Armenia.*

*Ethnic Armenian forces in Karabakh said Azerbaijani forces were trying to break through their defences after heavy shelling, but that they were holding the line for now.*

3/31/2023,PSA: Stop Parroting False Claims about US military assistance to Azerbaijan,"If it's one thing that angers me the most, it's a lack of claim verification. There's so much gossip and false news in the world, but more problem than the misinformation itself are those often well-meaning but incompetent professionals that disseminate it without making any effortful attempt to verify. Effortful is an overstatement. It takes an internet connection and a minute of their time.

There are a lot of Armenians and Armenian organizations (you know exactly who you are) who keep parroting the claim that the Biden administration is funding Azerbaijan's military en masse. Even when others call them out on it, question it, or ask for further quantitative details, they don't cease or refrain from making these statements. Rather double down on them, as if doing so will somehow turn their falsehoods into reality. \[Sounds like a neighbor or two we know, right?\]

There are two sources of data one can use when trying to assess US military aid to Armenia and Azerbaijan. One is [Foreignassistance.gov](https://Foreignassistance.gov) \[FA\] and the other is [https://securityassistance.org](https://securityassistance.org/security-sector-assistance/), \[SA\] providing governmental and and non-governmental sources respectively.

In fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019, according to SA, Azerbaijan received 59.6 million and 43.5 million in US military aid respectively. Til this day you still have Armenian-American organizations, lobbying, cultural and media, and Armenian activists claiming that Biden gave 100 million in military to Az. That is false. This occurred under Trump administration. Armenia was granted a measly 4 mil and 7.5 mil in 18' and 19'.

FA claims 27.5 million and 30 million were given to Az respectively but only that a fraction of that aid is military, amounting to 12 million and 14 million in 18' and 19'. Who is more correct?

In this case SA, because FA omits the amount of military aid that was provided to Az in the form on non-cash assets such as electronics, vehicles and other American hardware or armor placed on Azerbaijan's border with Iran.

Covid happened in 2020, which caused the US to drastically reduce military aid to all countries, including Azerbaijan although Armenia's military assistance was not cut and remained at 7 million. And 2021 was the first year of Biden's presidency. Did anything change?

Yes. And the fact Armenians complain about the progress that has been made dumbfounds me. SA reports Azerbaijan received 0.6 million in military aid both in 2021 and 2022. From tens and dozens of millions annually to a couple hundred thousand is a significant drop in magnitude. I can't express how much of a boon this is to Armenian interests. SA claims Armenia received 0.6 million and 6.5 million military aid in 21' and 22'.

Unlike SA, FA claims it provided zero in military aid to Azerbaijan and Armenia in 21' and '22.

This analysis looks at military aid, not economic aid. For civilian aid, there is only the FA data I know of because SA only concerns itself with security assistance.

According to FA, for economic aid. the US under the Biden administration provided 38 mil to Armenia in 2022 in economic aid and 15 mil to Azerbaijan. 37 mil to Armenia in 2021 and 14 million to Azerbaijan.

Is there a risk of double counting? Yes. When the Department of State provides aid, Security Assistance might flag that as military while the federal government would classify it as economic.

What does the data tell us? That there were monumental shifts in aid provisions to Azerbaijan and Armenia following transmission to the Biden administration. The Biden administration may still waive section 907, but for all intents and purposes, military aid to Azerbaijan has practically been eradicated in line with the demands of Armenian lobbying organizations who have failed to acknowledge or express any sort of gratitude, diplomatic or genuine, for this development and policy alignment.

Is the data perfect? No. The US often provides aid clandestinely and it is not reported until years after the fact. It's very likely we don't know the true total amount provided to Azerbaijan and Armenia but we do know some considerable fraction of it, whatever portion is shared with the public or is accessible by influential think tanks following some investigation. And as voters that is what we have to work with.

There are Armenian organizations and activists indirectly campaigning against the Biden administration, baselessly claiming it is arming up Azerbaijan, that it 'betrayed' us etc.. Not only are these statements false, they imprudently reflect a failure to conduct proper risk assessment as their constant prattle and misinformation dissemination compels Armenians in the community to vote for a candidate in the next election who is statistically more likely to return to the Trump era status quo where the US neglected Armenia and armed Azerbaijan.

Moreover, it ignores all the progress that has been achieved in the aid dept once Erdogan and Aliyev's business buddy Don left the throne and an administration that lacks Azeri financial conflicts of interests and is moderately more sympathetic to Armenia came to power. Do Armenian organizations care about that progress? Evidently not because no one talks about the changes that have been made. The community simply remains uninformed.

If we fail to become a data-driven nation, we, or at least those Armenians in charge of influential organizations, will ignorantly continue to make decisions that harm our interests.

Disclaimer: I am not a registered democrat. I am a political independent and am not 'simping' for Biden. This analysis is purely looking at Armenian and Armenian-American interests reflecting in the categories of aid contrasting two administrations.  


Edit:  
What I wish to know is if Hanlon's razor applies. Are these activists or Armenian organizations spreading categorical misinformation pertaining to the Biden administration's provisions to Armenia and Azerbaijan acting ignorantly or are they being ordered to promote falsehoods by malicious actors or other political entities?"

Samvel Babayan's negotiation plan with Azerbaijan || West vs Russia","##interview with military expert Artsrun Hovhannisyan | Condition of S300 air defense units | Smerch and artillery imported by Armenia and Azerbaijan | Arms contracts 

**REPORTER:** The #1 reason why we lost the 2020 war?

**ARTSRUN:** We overestimated our strength and underestimated our opponent. 

**REPORTER:** What mistakes did the government make during the war?

**ARTSRUN:** During a war, the decisions are made by the military-political leadership. If we ignore all the pre-existing problems that had accumulated prior to the war and focus only on the wartime decisions, the War Commission's investigation has revealed the following problems:  

1) Being too lax on deserters and disorderly conduct. The first deserters from the mobilized troops should have been tied to *the Pole of Shame* like they did in Ukraine.

**REPORTER:** In 1994, Vazgen Sargsyan was catching deserters in airports and sending them back to the front.

**ARTSRUN:** That's what was missing in 2020.

**REPORTER:** ... or doing what Gen. Samvel Babayan used to do in Artsakh?

**ARTSRUN:** I don't know, it's a matter of taste. We should have been a lot tougher in 2020.

**REPORTER:** We've criticized the Armenian government but doesn't Artsakh's military-political leadership also share the blame? An absurd myth was developed after the 90s' that Armenia supposedly didn't help Artsakh to win the 1st war; Artsakh's leadership received full credit for the victory. So why are we giving full credit to the Artsakh government for the 1st victory, but not assigning the full blame on them for the defeat in the 2nd?

**ARTSRUN:** I agree. My criticism of lax policies during the war was primarily aimed at Artsakh leadership. 

**REPORTER:** But wasn't Armenia's CoGS managing the war? 

**ARTSRUN:** That's irrelevant. The second legal pyramid was created to give Artsakh's military-political leadership independent powers. When it came to purely the military pyramid, there was a clear subordination system between Armenia's CoGS and Artsakh's Defense Army, but this wasn't the case with other types of forces such as NSS border forces, police forces, etc. Some of them never sent a single report to Armenia's CoGS for years. They were fully independent. 

Here is what the army leadership was doing for 20 years instead of reforms. Instead of promoting young officers who graduated from Greek [NATO] or other schools, they were promoting drivers and cooks from the 1st war who were ""good boys"" and obeyed them well in the 90s'. [Someone's ջահել]

Artsakh had 9 defense districts without counting the separate artillery, tank, and separate military units. I'm challenging the critics to study the 1994-2020 period and tell me the number of people, who joined the army after 1994 and graduated from domestic or international military academies, who were assigned to command a regiment/brigade in Artsakh. 

**REPORTER:** There was no political pressure on the military to reform?

**ARTSRUN:** Exactly. And there was no pressure to modernize armament, either. The sides began to make more or less serious weapon purchases, and not rely primarily on the equipment left from the first war, starting in 2003-2004. Before 2003, Armenia's new stuff was almost solely ""gifts"" from Russia. They were sending old Soviet stuff from storage. Some were broken, and some were half-fine.

Azeris make large-scale purchase contracts starting in 2003. It reaches a peak in 2007-2008 with the largest contracts surpassing $2bn-$3bn. The suppliers were Israel, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, etc. These weapons began to arrive in 2009-2010. By 2011 they were receiving the largest batches (200-300 units) of modern tanks, 100-200 units of new artillery, drones, etc. Starting in 2011, Azerbaijan had higher quality and newer assault-oriented weapons.

The first time Armenia paid attention to this topic was in 2012 when they ""expressed interest"" by inquiring Russia about the available new weapons. Significant negotiations begin only in 2014, and in 2015 we received very few units of certain models. You could count them on my 5 fingers.   

**REPORTER:** They purchased modern air defense but in a small quantity?

**ARTSRUN:** No, the purchased air defense units weren't even modern. Do you remember the massive PR story around the import of 5-6 divisions of S300? They were a ""gift"" from Russia, in a non-operational condition, sent from the Moscow Military District. We spend 5 years on fixing them, .. [unintelligible]

**REPORTER:** ... so we were էշի ականջում քնած all those years?

**ARTSRUN:** Yes, and everyone with military background knew about this at the time but the politically-motivated deceptions continued.

The first pair of SMERCH stations, which in reality played a significant role during the war, were imported in the autumn of 2016. Armenia and Artsakh had a total of 6 units of SMERCH when the war began. Azerbaijan imported the first unit in 2011, and entered the war with 32 units, without counting the other 20 units that had a similar diameter but with a 2x-3x longer reach. This played a decisive role during the war.

Moreover, Armenia's 6 Smerches were firing missiles only 1-3 pieces at a time, like a grandma taking her pills. It didn't have the potential of a 12-unit volley fire effect. We didn't have the missiles. In comparison, Azerbaijan's 50 pieces of 300+ caliber units played a decisive role. It wasn't just their drones.

They had 1,000-1,500 drones with 50+ km reach. They started purchasing them starting 2005, and especially in 2010-2012.

This was the difference between $2bn and $20bn, sleeping for 8 years while the opponent prepared, then responding with 10x fewer purchases.

##Nagorno-Karabakh president about the food shortage, peacekeepers, and ""puppet masters""

In response to criticism from opposition officials who claimed that PM Pashinyan is controlling President Arayik's moves.

**ARAYIK:** Lots of populist statements were made by our opposition colleagues. You've left me no choice but to answer: the only one that's being managed from Yerevan is you. You are taking orders from the Armenian opposition.

**ANGRY OPPOSITION MP:** [interrupts]

**ARAYIK:** Silence... Last time you accused me of surrendering three settlements in the Lachin Corridor to Azerbaijan. Yes, we were forced to hand over 3 villages in Qashatagh (Berdzor) in order to avoid much bigger losses and total extinction. We're doing everything possible to avoid large-scale military clashes. I have shared with you every message exchanged between us, Russian peacekeepers, and Azeris. Russians were *forcing* us to hand over those settlements. So why don't you go and demand action from Russia instead, and ask them why [they aren't been following their promises]. 

You've always claimed it isn't the peacekeepers' fault, and I've always coordinated my actions with peacekeepers. It isn't [Pashinyan] forcing us to do it, it's the peacekeepers.

There were complaints about beer being imported [through a blockade]. You know very well it wasn't imported through official channels. We were using our very limited resources on securing food deliveries for our residents. Why don't we arrest those who imported beer, you may wonder. Well, then we must arrest many people. You know that hundreds of people on both sides, you know who, are engaged in that process.

It was a batch of imports that was outside of the import allowance allocated to Artsakh, you could say. *[Russian peacekeepers allegedly imported party stuff, pissing off the locals. Unverified, but doesn't require a rocket science degree to understand who imported it.]* It wasn't imported through vehicles belonging to us. Were we supposed to ban the entry of those vehicles? Were we supposed to shut down any store that sold non-essential products? We've struggled to import necessities, we've done everything in our power. 

Here is an item missing from shelves: vegetable oil. We will soon have limited quantities of locally produced oil, it won't taste as good, but at least it'll be there. We couldn't import more oil. Do you even understand how difficult it is to feed 120,000 people when your imports are limited, and some of your imports must be construction materials for essential repairs?

Since you've accused me of populism, I'll say this: our opposition cares about Coca-Cola on the shelves and Armenia's internal political life more than the state of our Defense Army. I haven't received a single letter from them asking about the army and how to help it. Sorry [for the fiery speech]. Thanks. Come and ask us to explain what we're doing to strengthen the army. Meet us. We will hear your opinions. 

https://youtu.be/uScnMeeb5UM



##Nagorno-Karabakh president explains the reason why there are no direct negotiations with Azerbaijan

**ARAYIK:** We either endure this hardship and reach our goal of being recognized as an independent state, or we enjoy Coca-Cola and freely travel through Lachin Corridor with our Azerbaijani passports. 

We've seen worse days. You can criticize me for not accumulating enough food reserves in advance, sure, but such reserves would have lasted only months, while our struggle is long-term. We do have some local production, so do not be dishearted and do not give up. Sadly we lost thousands of hectares to poor weather conditions. If not for that, we could have been self-sufficient. We've also lost lands during the invasion.

We will spend this winter without gas and electricity. Azerbaijan has offered to resume the flow if we send an envoy to Baku. Why have we rejected it? Because they only want to discuss  ""integration"", and nothing else. 

I've attempted to negotiate with them for 2 years. If you think I did a poor job, then you should know that I wasn't the negotiator during the last phase. The negotiations yielded no results because Azerbaijan only demands one thing, and they do this during all formats: UN, U.S., etc.

This is what Azerbaijan demands in order for them to even agree to sit down around the same table with us: ""dissolve your army"". And here is what their plan is, chronologically:

1) We visit Baku and declare the dissolution of our Defense Army.

2) We dissolve the governing system.

3) They create a mechanism for community elections.

4) They resume the flow of gas and electricity, and we'll be able to cross the Lachin corridor as Azerbaijani citizens.

We are not against negotiations with Azerbaijan. We were the ones who wanted it the most. So let's understand that we are definitely going to have problems, but it is all surmountable. We must work on our resilience and self-defense.

##where was this Artsakh-Azerbaijan meeting supposed to take place?

Last month the U.S. offered to mediate direct talks between Baku and Stepanakert, somewhere outside of Artsakh, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. 

Artsakh rejected it because of the aforementioned conditions set forth by Azerbaijan, according to the leader of the ruling party of Artsakh. 

**PARTY LEADER:** Even the efforts by Russian peacekeepers were futile. They organized a meeting with Azeris in March. We attempted to discuss humanitarian issues, but after the meeting, Azeris claimed we were discussing topics of ""integration"".

##U.S. ambassador to Armenia about the negotiations

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. reaffirms its stance that the rights and security of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh must be protected. There must be negotiations, the outcome of which should protect these rights. Families must feel safe in their homes and their environment. All sides have an agreement around this. Now there are efforts to find ways to achieve that. 

**REPORTER:** Do you believe it is possible to organize a direct Baku-Stepanakert dialogue?

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** Any negotiation is a step in the right direction. We must ensure that the concerns of both sides are heard, so they can find a road to peace, which will guarantee the rights and security of those who live in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**REPORTER:** Russia has a vital interest in the South Caucasus, so its heavy involvement in the mediation process is understandable. Why is the U.S. so active? Critics accuse the U.S. of attempting to drive Russia out of the region. If this happens, Armenia will be left alone against Turkey and Azerbaijan, say your critics.

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. believes that Armenia, as an independent state, can decide who its partners and allies are, and what its foreign policy direction will be. What the U.S. wants is peace in Europe and South Caucasus. We are ready to work with anyone who's trying to bring a piece in these regions. The U.S. and EU are heavily involved in this process because we both see that peace in this region would be very beneficial for us. 

We have strong interests in Armenia. We share the same democratic values. Armenia is truly a bright spot in this region in terms of democracy. It is advancing its reform agenda, it has freedom of the press and speech, and democracy that's strengthening every day. The U.S. views democratic states as the most stable states, with stable relations with other members of the international community.   

**REPORTER:** Your critics believe you will choose Azerbaijan's oil over Armenia's democracy. Iran is defending Armenia's territorial integrity from Azerbaijan, while authoritarian Azerbaijan is engaged in a ""verbal conflict"" with Iran. The U.S. then blames Iran for being a destabilizing force in the region. Why? 

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** As an independent state, Armenia can choose to have whatever relations it wants with its neighbor Iran. We value the fact that Armenia is maintaining the sanctions on Iran set by the U.S. But past that, Armenia itself must decide what relations to have with Iran.

**REPORTER:** Is the OSCE Minsk Group *dead* dead?

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. is attempting to find ways to move the existing negotiations forward. Sadly, with its aggressive actions in Ukraine, Russia has proven itself as an unreliable partner, so we've been working with our trusted partners in the EU. No, the Minsk Group hasn't been dissolved, so if it's possible to have a constructive work environment in that format, we would certainly consider it.

**REPORTER:** A U.S. firm is building a metallurgy plant on the border with Azerbaijan. Shots were fired by Azerbaijan. 

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. believes that Azeri and Armenian forces should conduct a mirrored pullback of their forces from the border to avoid such incidents. We hope the sides will reach an agreement to do so. 

**REPORTER:** Can you give us some weapons? *[Bruh, might as well keep her hostage in exchange for a Himars]*. That would restore the balance of power and make peace negotiations more effective. Today maximalist Azerbaijan believes it can act with impunity.

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** Azerbaijan is negotiating. They sit around the table and hold talks with Armenia. The U.S. has done everything possible to promote the process. Yes, we do have relations with Armenia in the security field. At the request of Armenia, we are doing things to help Armenia's security. We highly appreciate Armenia's involvement in global peacekeeping. There have been many exercises involving Armenia to promote the potential of its peacekeeping forces. We've also provided assistance in the military-medical field. The mobile medical stations have already saved lives. We also have exchange programs involving military experts; Armenian officers visit the U.S. to study our experience. We are also discussing Armenia's needs in the future. We are always open to such discussions. I'd say we already have serious relations with Armenia in this area. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan wants a corridor via Armenia. They are threatening.

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** Threats = no good. The U.S. is encouraging the sides to discuss improvements in their transportation systems. The USAID has carried out an assessment of the transport field in Armenia and presented various routes. These are roads in general, not just connected to Azerbaijan. We want to encourage both sides to develop their roads. Having better connections in the region would be only beneficial in the case of Armenia. It will help Armenian goods to reach other places and to import goods from other places like Europe. This will reduce Armenia's overreliance on [Russia]. It would also increase Armenia's energy independence. 

**REPORTER:** Will the Turkey-Armenia border open?

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. is encouraged by the direct talks between AM-TR. The normalization of relations will bring many benefits to Armenia, and it will make the entire region more stable. It was a very kind gesture by Armenia to deliver humanitarian aid to Turkey after the earthquake. My colleagues in Turkey have informed me that Turkey greatly appreciated that move. Turkish residents who received the aid on the ground were very appreciative. These gestures are helping build trust between the people.

##interview with Nagorno-Karabakh opposition politician and former Security Council Gen. Samvel Babayan about building trust between Armenians and Azeris 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan's continuous blockade of the Lachin Corridor has resulted in a food shortage crisis. Artsakh authorities are rejecting any dialogue with Azerbaijan outside of international platforms, while Azerbaijan rejects any negotiations with a mediator because they consider this as an internal matter. Should Artsakh authorities agree to direct talks, or continue their ""boycott""?

**BABAYAN:** First of all, Azerbaijan is not against any negotiation with a mediator. There was supposed to be a meeting at the suggestion of the U.S. but Artsakh authorities rejected it. I believe there must be direct talks aimed at building trust, completely unrelated to ""status"" talks. The two nations first need to learn to live peacefully together. Everything else can be discussed later. Without this, you can negotiate another 30 years without a result. 

If Azerbaijan doesn't agree to build trust with Armenians, then Azerbaijan won't achieve its main goal of expelling Russians from here.

**REPORTER:** Do you agree that Azerbaijan doesn't mind if Russian peacekeepers assume the role of the 3rd party mediator?

**BABAYAN:** No. It's the exact opposite. Azerbaijan wants direct Stepanakert-Baku talks. As the leader of the second political force in Artsakh, I'm not against that idea, but Artsakh must first develop a negotiation document aimed at building trust.

**REPORTER:** I didn't mean using Russia as a state as the 3rd party mediator. I meant the commander of Russian peacekeepers on the ground. Could he just sit around the table as a mediator? 

**BABAYAN:** No. Azerbaijan wants one on one meetings. It's not just Artsakh residents who are under blockade, it's also the peacekeepers. They are trying to force Russians to use Azerbaijani-controlled Aghdam road to deliver supplies, instead of the Lachin Corridor.

**REPORTER:** Regardless of the format, Azerbaijan will demand the following: dissolve the Defense Army, accept Azerbaijani citizenship, and dissolve the government structure. This will leave the future of many Artsakh residents with Armenian ties and citizenship in limbo. What solutions do you see?

**BABAYAN:** You and I look at this issue from different angles. I'm not sure what Azerbaijan's end goal is, but my proposal is to discuss a package that contains points of common interests, to gain trust towards each other. Azerbaijan should pull back its troops, create a Green Zone, etc. Many things can be done to build trust. 

Artsakh must present this document to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan will reply with its version. None of this will contain any talks about a 'status'. It's about building trust for now. If we try this and it doesn't work, then we go back to ""digging trenches"". Don't ""think"" on behalf of Azerbaijan, give them an opportunity to reply in written form. 

If Azerbaijan rejects it, only then you can tell the superpowers that you've tried everything but Azerbaijan rejected all diplomacy. Right now we are just complaining about something that Azerbaijan hasn't even presented in written form. 

**REPORTER:** You have a different stance than the Artsakh authorities. You disagree that negotiations *must* be held with an international mediator. You believe a direct dialogue is necessary to start building something large with small steps. What political leverage do you have to convince the Artsakh government to adopt your approach? Would you agree to be the negotiator?

**BABAYAN:** Artsakh government and opposition parties both have the same demand: negotiations with the presence of an international mediator, and Artsakh participating as an ""equal"" party. I disagree with both [government and opposition parties]. Similarly, Azerbaijan's demands that Artsakh must become a small community managed by Baku is also too extreme. My proposal is to take small steps towards trust, so the two people won't feel a heavy burden anymore. With that done, during the second phase, when deeper issues are discussed, we can invite international structures to take part in those talks, or we can invite them at the very end. 

The Artsakh government and opposition parties are trying to avoid any responsibility. They say ""it won't work"" but they forget that they are responsible for the lives of 120,000 people and they must resolve these issues. President Arayik's 35,000 voters must take to the streets and demand action. If you demand, I will serve you.

**REPORTER:** To serve as a president or as a negotiator? Are you calling for a 2018-style revolution in Artsakh?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. If the president is against the negotiation plan that I just explained, then how can he assign me as an envoy to negotiate that plan on behalf of the state? Someone has to assume full responsibility and enter into negotiations. Since Artsakh has already held a referendum and declared its independence, if a time comes and there is a need to discuss our status with Azerbaijan, we will first need to hold a vote in Artsakh to authorize the negotiator to negotiate it. But this isn't the topic of discussion at this phase. We must first build human relations and trust.

**REPORTER:** Have you spoken with President Arayik about your plan? Did you offer him your help?

**BABAYAN:** On numerous occasions. I send him the list of points that need to be negotiated with Azerbaijan at this stage. The government and opposition must gather together and draft one document and assume some responsibility. The public is currently waiting to see what will happen. Nothing good will happen, they are going to drive you off the cliff if no action is taken.

**REPORTER:** Russian peacekeepers won't stop Azeri soldiers if they decide to invade Artsakh now. How would the events unfold in such a scenario?

**BABAYAN:** Develop a document and go negotiate if you don't want that scenario. But I think Azerbaijan understands me very well. They understand that if they push too hard, a third party [Russia] will enter the game and it will be even less beneficial for Azerbaijan. It's in Azerbaijan's best interest not to do this. The big players will play, while both our countries will suffer. Let's give these negotiations a try. If it doesn't work, we will have another war, but at least we've tried.

**REPORTER:** Would Armenia send military support to Artsakh in the event of an attack? Artsakh Defense Army isn't in a position to defend Stepanakert today.

**BABAYAN:** No, but a bloody move would result in a serious international backlash, including by Russia. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of peacekeepers firing back because many cards are in play there for Russia. I also wouldn't rule out action by Iran. This is why I think it's possible to sit down and hold talks with Azerbaijan. I'm confident in my negotiation proposal, I know why it could work.

**REPORTER:** Artsakh sent you as the negotiator after the 1st war. You sat with Russian and Azeri envoys. Azeris know you very well, and your contribution to the 90s' victory. What makes you think Azeris will want to speak with you considering your participation in the war? 

**BABAYAN:** There is not a single person who grew up in Artsakh who hasn't fought a war. But it doesn't matter if they will speak with me or someone else who represents my ideas.

**REPORTER:** In your 5-point plan to develop Artsakh, you mention the need to create a professional army. How can you do this under a blockade, when the imports are restricted? Was this plan drafted when Lachin was still open?

**BABAYAN:** Perhaps we won't even need it if Azerbaijan agrees to hold talks around building trust, Green Zone, etc. Maybe we will create a [unintelligable] Guard. The goal is to achieve peace and for us to remain in our homeland and live our lives.    

**REPORTER:** A strong Armenian army could also benefit Artsakh's security. Tell us about the army issues exposed during the 2020 war, and whether steps are being taken to address them. 

**BABAYAN:** I've been isolated from Armenia for 4 months now, so I don't know. Artsakh must secure its own defense, and we will do it. Azerbaijan must understand that our door isn't open, they can't just walk in. But how this is done or whether it's even *necessary* will depend on the level of trust between us.

**REPORTER:** EU wants to further expand the number of observers on the AM-AZ border. They often visit the border with Artsakh. Do you believe they are a stabilizing force, including for Artsakh?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. Azerbaijan is being pressured primarily by the U.S. and EU today because Russia is busy in Ukraine. This pressure from the West is why Azerbaijan is more ""humble"" today. Yes, I believe observers have a significant contribution to stabilizing the region. We must use this opportunity to regain strength.

**REPORTER:** Armenian government is trying to send international observers to Artsakh as well. Pashinyan and Mirzoyan have been discussing this with their EU colleagues.

**BABAYAN:** I support that. We need a UN presence, an international body that can gather the facts on the ground. As for military presence, for now, only Russian peacekeepers can be here, but we can't predict what will happen in a couple of years.

**REPORTER:** What was your takeaway from Pashinyan's statement and Q&A at the War Commission? He spoke about the problems in the military.

**BABAYAN:** He repeated what I had been saying for years. The military leadership was unorganized, weak, and had low standards. How can an officer refuse an order from a general? The Army Commander issues an order to attack but a Lt. Colonel disobeys the order. This mess is what led us to defeat. We don't need the prime minister to give a speech about these incidents being under investigation. These officers must have been arrested and punished long ago. I am aware of criminal investigations, some of which have already reached the court.

**REPORTER:** You were Artsakh's Security Council chief during the war and you took part in the preparation of one of the counteroffensives. Your plan was approved by Artsakh Defense Army commander and Armenia's army command CoGS. The operation failed because the commander of one of the tank battalions refused to fight. There is a criminal investigation against that commander today. Tell us about that operation.

**BABAYAN:** I made a proposal but did not take part in the process to draft that plan because I didn't have details about the personnel and other nuances, so the plan had to be created by the army command. In 1993 we liberated the same areas with a similar plan. They created a plan, investigated the area, and launched the attack. 

Azeris did not put up a resistance because they thought the approaching soldiers were friendlies. Our forces succeeded there. But then the second unit disobeyed the order and refused to move forward. Besides this, none of the two brigades showed up in time at 7 am that morning. [When they did, not everyone delivered all the necessary equipment.]
They were supposed to deliver 44 tanks and 30-40 armored vehicles. They instead brought 12 tanks and a few armored vehicles. 

The commander should have delayed the offensive by 2 days to sort out the problems. Instead, they engaged with the opponent. But even after these mistakes, our troops forced Azeris to route in confusion. There were no Azeris in sight for 3 whole hours. But our forces did not advance, they remained in place, refused to carry out orders, then the following day they were unable to reorganize. It was a result of unprofessionalism. We could have won this war if they weren't *that* unorganized.

Why do you think the commanding officer of the tank battalion refused to engage? [The commander allegedly learned that the plan belonged to Babayan and refused to follow it for political reasons, according to Babayan.] 

**REPORTER:** Why did that brigade commander refuse? Intentional or irresponsible?

**BABAYAN:** 20 tanks mysteriously broke down on their way from Stepanakert to Fizuli [battlefield]. Did the commander sabotage the operation intentionally? I don't know. There needs to be an investigation. 80% of the ranking officers weren't in their place. Do you understand what that means? There was no order whatsoever. These officers didn't join the army to fight, they just wanted to be security guards.

**REPORTER:** The War Commission revealed that Armenians had 117,000 soldiers but they couldn't bring 5,000 to defend Shushi.

**BABAYAN:** That is the wrong number. We actually had *more* than that, but the number isn't what's important. The problem with Shushi was in their defense tactic and the fact that the commanders weren't ""present"", from top to bottom. This wasn't an issue with the army having an insufficient number of soldiers to defend Shushi. They could have easily moved troops around had it been necessary. But they didn't do the necessary maneuvers. Someone said, *""No, we are waiting for the main assault from this direction, don't carry out any operations there""*. I can't speak about this publicly but you should know that there were multiple strategies to defend Shushi. It's just that there was no one to properly command it.

As an Armenian, I've been reflecting on the historical relationship between our countries and the potential for a brighter future. I would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on whether it's possible to restore the ties we once shared during the Soviet period.

Growing up, I heard countless stories from my family about the peaceful coexistence that existed in both Armenia and Azerbaijan. For instance, my paternal grandparents, originally from the Shamkir region in Azerbaijan, lived harmoniously alongside Azerbaijani neighbors. Likewise, my maternal grandparents, who were from Sevan, Armenia, shared their lives with many Azerbaijani residents in their community. It's fascinating to hear that my grandfather was even fluent in Azerbaijani! Even my dad used to have frequent business trips to Baku (there was a train connection between Yerevan and Baku, how crazy is that!).

It deeply saddens me to witness how this once (more or less) harmonious connection has deteriorated into the adversarial situation we find ourselves in today. But I want to believe that the shared experiences and bonds we had during the Soviet era show that peaceful coexistence is indeed achievable.

So I'd like to hear your perspectives on this matter. Do you believe that there is hope for a renewed relationship between our nations? How do you envision the path towards peace? Isn't it possible to scratch the hostilities that happened on both sides and start from a new page?"

A lot of Western academic Marxists, who have always been anti-Christian and pro-Islam, are ironically shedding crocodile tears for Armenians and their media outlets are overwhelmingly biased for Armenia's point of view (probably not different from them bragging about ""equality"" while bullying disabled students to suicide or career destruction, i.e. ableism)

Some of these Western academic Marxists are very vocal about their support for Ukraine, but don't they realise that Armenia is an ally of Russia, i.e. still in the CSTO, complicit in the renewed Russian genocide of Ukrainians in occupied territories? Isn't it funny for the Armenian government to demand Western support while continuing their dirty alliance with Russia? 

While the same group of Western academic Marxists have always been anti-NATO since the Cold War going against the popular will of the very oppressed Ukrainians they claimed to support, if not the majority of Eastern Europeans whose countries have joined the NATO. 

I can't explain why I have a very strong impression that the reason those Western academic Marxists are so biased against Azerbaijan – backed by NATO member Turkey – is that it is simply a psychological extension of their anti-NATO sentiment. 

What do you think?"
12/25/2021,Israelis/Palestinians: who do you usually side with between Armenia and Azerbaijan?,"It is well known that there is a strong connection between the governments and people of Israel and Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has limited anti-Semitism and the Jewish community there lives very well, especially when compared to other neighboring nations. During the last conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Israel sided with Azerbaijan. I am interested to know if this is also the common view of the Israeli people.

Due to shared history of persecution, many Jewish Americans expressed stronger sympathies with the Armenian people. Both groups have been systemically targeted for genocide… one in the Holocaust and the other in the Armenian Genocide. Yet Israel doesn’t officially recognize the Armenian Genocide nor does Armenia officially recognize the Holocaust.

Palestinians share a religion with Azerbaijan but a closer history with Armenia, with Palestine having served as one place of refuge for Armenians fleeing genocide and there is an Armenian quarter in Jerusalem. I don’t know if any recent shared history with Azerbaijan. So I have no knowledge of how Palestinians viewed the conflict between these two nations and am hoping to ask.

9/23/2023,Why Brussels and Washington don't offer a friendly hand to the democratic Armenia on their struggle against the autocratic Azerbaijan?,"I think the whole point of being a successful rich democratic world power is to spread good things around the world, particularly when you don't have strong interests (like Ukraine). Helping democracies struggling against authoritarian regimes should be a must, particularly in the case of Armenia, that most certainly would cost a fraction of the US budget (for comparison, the much larger Ukraine war costs 10% of the U.S. Department of Defense budget or 0.3% of the U.S. GDP)

Azerbaijan is a petrostate that exports through Georgia and Turkey a lot of oil and gas to Europe. That said, their oil production is like 500k barrels of oil per day, it's like 0.5% of total worldwide consumption. 

The equilibrium of forces there means that a coalition of unexpected allies helps the autocratic Azerbaijan: Israel helps Azerbaijan because of their feud with Iran, Turkey helps Azerbaijan because Azerbaijan is also ethnic Turkish, and Brussels helps Azerbaijan because of their oil and gas imports (particularly more important since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine)

This means that the much more democratic, but poor Armenia was left with Russia and Iran. But Russia isn't helping Armenia anymore since the 2022 Ukraine war, where Russia declined to protect Armenia under their Article 5 equivalent. 

What Azerbaijan is doing in Nagorno-Kharabak is terrible and it's even worst to realize how much Brussels and to a greater degree Washington are closing their eyes. They put Armenina in a position to need to allied with Western enemies, but now their own ally is doing genocide against Armenians.

Washington doesn't have much interests in the region, their only interests are because they babysit Europe. Why they don't mark a line in the sand and side with the democratic Armenia? Isn't that the whole point of being the leader of the free world?"

Speaking to reporters on his return flight from the Azeri exclave of Nackchivan, [Erdogan said](https://english.aawsat.com/world/4568966-t%C3%BCrkiye%E2%80%99s-erdogan-says-corridor-through-armenia-azerbaijan-iran-must-be-completed) that if Armenia does not allow the trade corridor to pass through its territory then Iran was warm to the idea of allowing it passage through its territory.

This means Iran would have full control of Turkey's corridor to Azerbaijan which is exactly what the latter two wanted to avoid. This is coupled with the [INSTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_North%E2%80%93South_Transport_Corridor) which is scheduled for completion in 2028 which will give Iran immense leverage over Azerbaijan. One of many reasons Iran considers its border with Armenia to be a red line, is because they want the INSTC to be able to go through Armenia and Georgia in case Azerbaijan doesn't tow the line.

**In conclusion:** Iran will emerge as the primary beneficiary of this regional conflict despite the fact that Turkey and Azerbaijan did their best to prevent this exact outcome."

5/16/2021,What are the lessons for the future of warfare we should take from the Azerbaijan-Armenia and Israeli-Gaza wars?,"I think we'll look back on the recent Azerbaijan-Armenia war and the Israeli-Gaza wars of the last decade (especially the 2021 war) as the beginning of a new era of combat. The first featured predominately Israeli and Turkish weapons systems vs Russian systems. The second was Israeli and American vs Iranian weapons.

**The Use of Drones**

Azerbaijan's domination of the skies via controlled, munition-bearing drones as well as the so-called ""suicide"" drone attacks was the core of their success in the conflict. The key advantages of a modern, large, coordinated drone force and the harsh disadvantage of a lack of anti-drone defenses was the overwhelming reason for Azerbaijan's quick victory. The day after I suspect that every major military in the world did an evaluation of their drone and anti-drone capabilities.

[Here's a nice summary of the weaponry and tactics involved.](https://www.csis.org/analysis/air-and-missile-war-nagorno-karabakh-lessons-future-strike-and-defense)

**Missile Defense**

[Pictures](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2021/05/000_99X76P-640x400.jpg) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWVGs0Q1K5k&t=1s&ab_channel=%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C) like these are similarly going to be screened around the world in the wake of the 2021 Israeli-Gazan war. In most wars to come, I doubt we'll see the indiscriminate fire on civilian cities that the Palestinians have employed in their wars against Israel but I fully expect to see air battles like these -- missiles and interceptors engaged in mass aerial combat -- above infantry, mechanical divisions and warships in the future. Smart missiles vs smart interceptors are going to attract huge defense department R&D budgets and will be a major part of weapons purchases.

**Tunnels**

Though the use of tunnels dug under the border into Israel played a major part in the 2014 war allowing Hamas to threaten terrorist infiltration of nearby Israeli communities and provoking an Israeli ground invasion to destroy them, Israel has since developed the tech to detect them reliably enough that they no longer present a meaningful threat. One lesson of the 2021 war is that offensive tunnels are unlikely to play a major role going forward.

**Arson as Terrorism**

In the wake of the Iron Dome's success, Palestinians began employing balloon-guided arson attacks
over the last few years. These haven't played a major role in the current war but have started hundreds if not thousands of fires near Israeli communities in a very dry and thus, easily ignited area over the last decade. I would not be surprised to see arson become a new approach employed by terrorist groups in the future as a convenient way to do a great deal of damage over a massive area while preventing easy identification of the attacker.

**Tactics for Targeting Combatants Embedded within Civilian Areas**

This is of course a major issue that militaries confronting terrorist/insurgent groups around the world will continue to deal with. There are a few new techniques employed in these wars that militaries in that situation may consider in the future. The first is the Israeli approach of calling, sending sms messages and ""roof knocking"" -- hitting the roof of a building that is going to be destroyed with empty shell missiles that don't do damage to the building itself but signal that it will be hit soon and cause anyone inside to evacuate. This approach has been very successful in the 2021 war after moderate success in 2014 when it was first introduced. Israelis have employed it in situations where there was significant terrorist infrastructure (cyber and intelligence command centers, rocket storage, military R&D facilities) embedded in otherwise civilian structures. They have used this on several high-rises in the last week and reports are that there are zero casualties from these operations so far. Obviously this isn't ideal when the most important part of the mission is striking the personnel rather than the equipment/facilities so it's certainly not an all-purpose solution but it's done a good job at preventing loss of civilian life in the cases where destroying the facilities were key. 

The second technique worth discussing is [the deliberate misdirection employed two days ago](https://www.timesofisrael.com/with-invasion-that-wasnt-idf-suspected-of-misleading-press-to-trick-hamas/) -- reporting that a ground invasion had started and moving tanks and personnel around the border to sell the story in order to push militants into their underground tunnel system before taking the tunnel system out with air strikes. This particular move will likely not be heavily replicated as surprises like these have a limited shelf life. But increased use of deception for the purpose of achieving separation between combatants and civilians, especially in the fake news era, will probably stick around. Obviously using deception in warfare is as old as warfare itself but I don't remember seeing it employed for specifically this reason -- to draw out combatants from their hiding places within civilian areas. Maybe someone else remembers other examples?

**The Importance of Synchronization**

Both the Palestinians and the Israelis, as well as the Azerbaijanis, have shown increasing coordination in large scale attacks. The Palestinians have been launching massive volleys of rockets simultaneously at Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities within the span of minutes and sometimes seconds in an effort to overwhelm the Israeli Iron Dome in 2021. Israelis have similarly improved their coordination to launch massive simultaneous attacks on the Gazan tunnel system and a coordinated strike on Hamas leaders all over the strip -- each pulled off with impressively tight synchronization. One lesson of this is that in the era of missile warfare, we should expect massive battles in the sky over a very short period as opposed to long drawn out attacks with a few missiles being fired at a time over a longer period. The other (and this applies to the Azerbaijani-Armenian experience as well) is that in the era of advanced telecommunications capabilities intelligent coordination between different divisions operating simultaneously is going to be crucial. In Israel's case this was done with the [fireweaver system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJHjcukNbpw&ab_channel=RAFAELAdvancedDefenseSystemsLtd.).

This is my analysis of the key military lessons to draw from the wars of the last few years.

Yeah, funny how the Armenians are putting their forces on their own land preventing a hostile Azeri invasion. This whole thing smells like a provocation caused by Russia before the negotiations in Brussels between Azeri and Armenian leaders. Someone in the Kremlin doesn’t want these negotiations to happen.

According to the existing trilateral agreement signed on November 9th, after the Artsakh War in 2020, security in the region has been provided by the Russian Peacekeeping Force (RPF). Peacekeepers are also responsible for free movement along the Lachin corridor. 

Peacekeepers have not interfered with the ongoing Azeri blockade that has been going since December 12th, 2022. Russian Peacekeepers are the only ones who can drive freely through the blockaded section, transporting supplies for their own needs while 120,000 Armenians in Artsakh go without food and medicine supplies and nobody has been allowed to fix the utility lines running to Artsakh, that were damaged before the blockade. 

From the beginning of the blockade, Russian newsletters have reported that no violations were recorded in the RPF area of responsibility. 

The silence of the Russian government and the lack of action by the RPF, despite the trilateral agreement confirms that Russia is no longer able to be a guarantor of security in the South Caucasus. It also appears that Russia has prevented the adoption of the UN Security Council statement about the Azeri blockade of Artsakh. 

Due to the war in Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions on Russian gas export, Russia is actively strengthening cooperation with Turkey and Azerbaijan to transport Russian gas to the EU. And for this Russia is ready go give up their influence in the South Caucasus...putting Armenians in the Republic of Armenia and Artsakh in serious danger. 

The Russian concessions in the region began in May 2021, when Azerbaijan occupied 41 square kms of Armenian territory in the direction of Syunik and Gegharkunik. Despite Armenia's membership in the CSTO, Russia has not taken any action and has not called Azerbaijan an aggressor limiting itself to calling for a ceasefire on both sides. 

The same events occured during the Azerbaijani aggression on September 13th, 2022, towards Jermuk, Sotk, Goris, Vardenis and other surrounding towns and villages. Additionally on August 25th, 2022, the RPF withdrew from Aghavno and Berdzor that are located along the Lachin corridor, transferring them under the control of Azerbaijan, contrary to the trilateral agreement. Residents were forced to leave their homes. 

The ongoing blockade of the Lachin corridor is the continuation of Azerbaijan's ethnic cleansing of Armenians, with Russia's permission."

**Information Point**

- Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

- The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the UN-mandated OSCE settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

- The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh.

- The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

- All reputable international media refer to Nagorno Karabakh as disputed.

- Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed autonomous region since 1923 which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

- Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918 until today. Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history going back millennia.

- The ceasefire agreement in 1994 had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh. 

- The UN Security Council resolutions do not recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, nor demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh, nor recognise Armenia as an invader, nor demand any withdrawals by Armenia, instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh.

Amidst the rapidly dilapidating Russian sphere of influence, **Azerbaijan has threatened to break the Russian-mediated truce and wage war on Armenia**, with several reports of artillery shelling inside Armenia's sovereign territory. Armenia has invoked CSTO's protocols and requested Russian military assistance but the small democracy has virtually no allies to turn to. 

**From now on, the megathreads will be covering both conflicts.** Hopefully the situation in the Caucasus can be rapidly resolved peacefully, as far too much blood has been shed there already from the 2020 war as well as previous conflicts. 

Feel free to discuss the ongoing events in Ukraine and Armenia/Azerbaijan here. Rules 5 and 11 are being enforced, but we understand the anger, please just do your best to not go too far (we have to keep the sub open).

This is not a thunderdome or general discussion thread. Please do not post comments unrelated to the conflict in Ukraine or Armenia/Azerbaijan here. Obviously take information with a grain of salt, this is a fast moving situation.

**Information Point**

- Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

- The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the UN-mandated OSCE settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

- The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh.

- The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

- All reputable international media refer to Nagorno Karabakh as disputed.

- Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed autonomous region since 1923 which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

- Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918 until today. Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history going back millennia.

- The ceasefire agreement in 1994 had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh. 

- The UN Security Council resolutions do not recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, nor demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh, nor recognise Armenia as an invader, nor demand any withdrawals by Armenia, instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh.

9/14/2022,"[Megathread] Russian Invasion of Ukraine, D+202 & Caucasus conflict","### Pending further major events in Ukraine, this will likely be the last war megathread for the near future. 

Ukraine's counter-offensive in Kharkiv has largely eased as Ukrainian forces consolidate their gains while continuing to attrition Russian forces on other fronts. 

Concurrently however, amidst the rapidly shrinking Russian sphere of influence, **Azerbaijan has repeatedly threatened to break the Russian-mediated truce and wage war on Armenia** with several reports of Azerbaijan shelling internationally recognised Armenian territory. In response, Armenia has invoked CSTO's protocols and requested Russian military assistance but the small democracy has virtually no allies to turn to and by all appearances Russia appears unwilling to assist Armenia.

We don't want /r/neoliberal to become a hub regarding the constant discussion of war, therefore unless there is 1) a huge surge of interest and submissions into this emerging war between Armenia/Azerbaijan or 2) Ukraine launches another counter-offensive, this will likely be the last megathread for the near term. It will almost certainly return in the future however. 

Feel free to discuss the ongoing events in Ukraine and Armenia/Azerbaijan here. Rules 5 and 11 are being enforced, but we understand the anger, please just do your best to not go too far (we have to keep the sub open).

This is not a thunderdome or general discussion thread. Please do not post comments unrelated to the conflict in Ukraine or Armenia/Azerbaijan here. Obviously take information with a grain of salt, this is a fast moving situation.

The return of the megathreads *will not be a permanent fixture*, but we aim to keep them up over the coming days depending on how fast events continue to unfold or potentially if a war erupts in the Caucasus.

7/16/2020,Azerbaijan's MOD threatens to shell Armenia's Nuclear Power Plant,
10/1/2020,[World] - Two French journalists in Armenia injured by Azeri shelling: Source | Al Arabiya,
9/10/2023,New war is underway. What you can do?,"There is a big military buildup in our border, azeris get weapons delivery almost daily from Turkey and Israel, trains reservists, accuses Armenia and Artsakh of firing on their positions several times a day. Also Iran made statements discouraging an aggression against Armenia. Let's not be blind and wishful, there is a war looming over our heads. Of course maybe the pressure on azeris will stop them this time(don't think it's likely), but if not now, given the nature of azeri regime, the war will inevitably come

So the question is - What can you do?

Well, since the good part of you are not in Armenia i will propose steps that you can undertake no matter what country you are in. I think there are two things that most of you can do.

# Donate to military organizations - they really do make difference

There are organizations in Armenia that train people to fight and also have their squads/battalions. When Armenia is attacked most of them go under MoD command and fight along with our soldiers, some of them stay to train more people. If you are not already donating but have the opportunity to do so, it's the time. Donations go way up in a time of active conflict, but the truth is, it takes time for your donation to take an effect, it takes time to train people, build fortifications, etc...   
Below I'll tell you about two of them, but there are many others which you can find in [AP](https://ap.am/)(i'll tell about this project as well).

## VOMA(The art of staying alive)

[Change yourself - Change the Armenia \/ Let's be a nation-army and build a country-fortress](https://preview.redd.it/3dwl7b738enb1.png?width=1640&format=png&auto=webp&s=e87263b75c7d65af4722d8a28eab3780a349fa16)

This is the first organization that comes to mind. Created by Vova Vardanov a hero of the first Nagorno-Karabakh war. He also created the first intel and spec-ops unit during the first NK war. He created VOMA to train people first aid and essential self-defense tactics. After 2016 war the organization became even more military-oriented. They have trained thousands(if not dozens of thousands) of people since that. There are dozens of branches throughout Armenia.   
Also the battalion of VOMA participated in 2020 war, praised to be very effective with minimal casualties. At the moment VOMA is training people in several formats - 3 month training, 6 month training and 10 days intensive training. Apart from standard military training they also have RPG and artillery courses.  


[Artillery courses in VOMA](https://preview.redd.it/nto4gm419enb1.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0699bdcfe20db6ac7be31eaaaf513f291cd7fdf)

Apart from this, Voma started building Gmbet-2 fortifications on the border with azerbaijan. Which are extremely important for both the Army and volunteer groups. Gmbet-2 is closed from the top and designed to withstand artillery shelling. They don't look very sexy but are very cheap and fast to build. One Gmbet-2 takes around 2 days to build and costs around 2500$

# Metsn Tigran regiment

>The ""Great Tigran"" military regiment is a volunteer military regiment, which was formed in 1989 on the basis of 15 volunteer detachments. The regiment has passed a glorious battle path. participated in the combat operations of almost all hotspots of RA and NKR. The regiment also participated in the April 4-Day and 2020 44-Day Wars. 9 freedom fighters of the regiment died heroically during the 44-day war. In order to keep the memory of our fallen friends alive and to continue their work, we have now initiated the construction of the training center of the Great Tigran Militia Regiment, where every Armenian can participate in military training courses.

# Armenian Peace

Armenian Peace is a website that allows people to explore and donate to defense-related projects. The goal of the project is to eventually make such a strong state, that is very costly to attack, and thus securing peace for Armenia. There are [one time](https://ap.am/en/fundraisers?type=oneTime) and [recurring](https://ap.am/en/fundraisers?type=recurring) projects that you can donate to, simply choose whichever project you think would have a bigger impact.

&#x200B;

# Can buy a military grade or dual-use equipment?

There are a lot of people who buy military-grade equipment, mostly night-vision googles, etc... You can contact the organizations above or any other that you trust and ask them what they need, but believe me, they never say no to drones :)

# Mass protests, spreading info and lobbying

The second thing is to reach out to journalists, public figures or whomever you can to spread awareness and pressure the government to action. You can try to reach out to your MP's or do something else depending on the country you are in.  
Another thing that is very important is protests. There are many ways of protesting, the simple gathering of people might not do, there are better ways. But I'm not gonna talk about them at the moment, because there are much more knowledgeable people out there.

* [According to the information released by the Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan, sabotage groups of the armed forces of Armenia used the mountainous relief of the area and existing valley gaps in the darkness of the day to mine the areas between the positions of the units of the Azerbaijani Army and the supply roads in different directions. As a result of urgent measures taken by our units in order to immediately prevent these acts, a battle took place. Some positions, shelters and bases of the Azerbaijani Army in the territory of Dashkasan, Kalbajar and Lachin regions by the units of the Armenian armed forces located in the direction of Basarkecher, Istisu, Garakilsa and Gorus settlements were fired with various types of weapons, including mortars. As a result, there are losses among personnel, damage to military infrastructure. - Meydan.Az](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cia-5kfMHJy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)"

> **Information Point**

> - **What is all this about?** On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with Turkish backing launched a war against the de facto Nagorno Karabakh Republic in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) through military means despite the existing peace process.

> - Azerbaijan has targeted 120 civilian settlements, including the capital Stepanakert with drones, missiles, smerch and artillery bombardment as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing half of the civilians to leave Nagorno Karabakh.

> - **Is Nagorno Karabakh occupied?** No. Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refrain from labelling Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, instead often label it as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918. 

> - Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) has three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - [Map with place names](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/02/fighting-nagorno-karabakh-is-about-local-territories-wider-rivalries/)

> - The four [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories. Instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and the latter to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions concern the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993.

> - **Is there a peace plan?** Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution package by OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

> - US Department of State in-depth [discussion of conflict resolution](https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/averting-all-out-war-nagorno-karabakh).

> **Information Point**

> - **What is all this about?** On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with Turkish backing launched a war against the de facto Nagorno Karabakh Republic in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) through military means despite the existing peace process.

> - Azerbaijan has severely damaged 130 civilian settlements including the capital Stepanakert with drones, missiles, smerch and artillery bombardment as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing half of the civilians to leave Nagorno Karabakh and remaining to live in underground shelters since the war started.

> - As of October 16, Azerbaijan's violence has caused: A total of 36 civilians have been killed - a little girl, 7 women and 28 men. A total of 115 people were wounded, of which 95 received serious injuries: 77 of them are male and 18 are female citizens. Severe damage inflicted upon civilians properties: 7800 private immovable properties, 720 private movable properties, 1310 infrastructure, public and industrial objects. 

> - Independent voices and experts have raised alarms of ethnic cleansing and a humanitarian catastrophe.

> - Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous as per the constitution of the de facto republic. 

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as occupied by the international community. It is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refrain from labelling Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, instead often label it as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918. 

> - Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) has three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - [Map with place names](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/02/fighting-nagorno-karabakh-is-about-local-territories-wider-rivalries/)

> - The four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories. Instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and the latter to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions concern the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993.

> - Same as above applies to the only existing UN General Assembly [resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the OSCE process to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. 

> - **Is there a peace plan?** Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution package by OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) and using [mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the indigenous Armenian population of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has severely damaged 130 civilian settlements including the capital Stepanakert with aerial, drones, missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic and artillery means as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of October 16, Azerbaijan's violence has resulted in: A total of 36 civilians have been killed - a little girl, 7 women and 28 men. A total of 115 people were wounded, of which 95 received serious injuries: 77 of them are male and 18 are female citizens. Severe damage inflicted upon civilians properties: 7800 private immovable properties, 720 private movable properties, 1310 infrastructure, public and industrial objects including [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html). Over 700 Armenian military personnel and volunteers have also been killed, making the KIA per capita higher than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE led by the US, France and Russia, and backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe, among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The European Parliament passed a [resolution in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20) supporting the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with the Armenia SSR.

> - The four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) call for cease of hostilities and mandate the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions followed the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above applies to the only existing non-binding [UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The majority of UN members states abstained from voting in favour of said resolution.

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with [Turkish](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) backing and using [Syrian mercenaries](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire due to the pandemic](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162).

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the indigenous Armenian population of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has severely damaged 130 civilian settlements including the capital Stepanakert with aerial, drones, missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic and artillery means as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) to leave Nagorno Karabakh and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of October 16, Azerbaijan's violence has resulted in: A total of 36 civilians have been killed - a little girl, 7 women and 28 men. A total of 115 people were wounded, of which 95 received serious injuries: 77 of them are male and 18 are female citizens. Severe damage inflicted upon civilians properties: 7800 private immovable properties, 720 private movable properties, 1310 infrastructure, public and industrial objects including [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html). Over 700 Armenian military personnel and volunteers have also been killed, making the KIA per capita higher than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE led by the US, France and Russia, and backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe, among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The European Parliament passed a [resolution in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20) supporting the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with the Armenia SSR.

> - The four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) call for cease of hostilities and mandate the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions mainly concern the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories.

The majority of states also abstained from voting in favour of said resolution.

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> **Information Point**

> - **What is all this about?** On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with Turkish backing launched a war against the de facto Nagorno Karabakh Republic in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) through military means despite the existing peace process.

> - Azerbaijan has severely damaged 130 civilian settlements including the capital Stepanakert with drones, missiles, smerch and artillery bombardment as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing half of the civilians to leave Nagorno Karabakh and remaining to live in underground shelters since the war started.

> - As of October 16, Azerbaijan's violence has caused: A total of 36 civilians have been killed - a little girl, 7 women and 28 men. A total of 115 people were wounded, of which 95 received serious injuries: 77 of them are male and 18 are female citizens. Severe damage inflicted upon civilians properties: 7800 private immovable properties, 720 private movable properties, 1310 infrastructure, public and industrial objects. 

> - Independent voices and experts have raised alarms of ethnic cleansing and a humanitarian catastrophe.

> - Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous as per the constitution of the de facto republic. 

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as occupied by the international community. It is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refrain from labelling Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, instead often label it as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918. 

> - Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) has three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - [Map with place names](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/02/fighting-nagorno-karabakh-is-about-local-territories-wider-rivalries/)

> - The four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories. Instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and the latter to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions concern the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993.

> - Same as above applies to the only existing UN General Assembly [resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the OSCE process to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. 

> - **Is there a peace plan?** Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution package by OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

My position is and has for a long time been that Armenia is the right side here, and even more so now with Azerbaijan's actions.
I am influenced by the documentaries I have watched on the war, and by Serj Tankian's activism and talks.
If any are curious, I would say this documentary is probably what has influenced me the most, aside from simply looking up the motivations, political allegiances, and history of the area.

9/27/2023,Iran Seemingly Emerges as the Victor & Turkey the Loser of the Azerbaijan-Armenia Conflict,"Tehran has repeatedly reiterated that any attack on Armenia's Syunik province is a bright red line for them. This time, an Iranian state-affiliated newspaper went even further, warning Azerbaijan of [‘Changes in Baku’](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-paper-warns-azerbaijan-of-changes-in-baku-if-it-presses-home-advantage-against-armenia-294225/) if it presses its luck against Armenia.

Speaking to reporters on his return flight from the Azeri exclave of Nackchivan, [Erdogan said](https://english.aawsat.com/world/4568966-t%C3%BCrkiye%E2%80%99s-erdogan-says-corridor-through-armenia-azerbaijan-iran-must-be-completed) that if Armenia does not allow the trade corridor to pass through its territory then Iran was warm to the idea of allowing it passage through its territory.

This means Iran would have full control of Turkey's corridor to Azerbaijan which is exactly what the latter two wanted to avoid. This is coupled with the [INSTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_North%E2%80%93South_Transport_Corridor) which is scheduled for completion in 2028 which will give Iran immense leverage over Azerbaijan. One of many reasons Iran considers its border with Armenia to be a red line, is because they want the INSTC to be able to go through Armenia and Georgia in case Azerbaijan doesn't tow the line.

**In conclusion:** As of now, Iran will seemingly emerge as the primary beneficiary of this regional conflict despite the fact that Turkey and Azerbaijan did their best to prevent this exact outcome."

2/26/2022,Armenia's conflict doesn't matter until we make it matter,"We're not Ukraine, and we need to realize that.

1. Most Westerners know about Eastern Europe. Most don't know about the Caucasus.
2. Ukraine has a population larger than Poland and is the largest European country excluding Russia. Armenia has a population smaller than Croatia and is geographically smaller than Belgium.
3. Ukraine has done literally nothing to harm Russia, while Armenia ethnically cleansed Azerbaijanis from the seven formerly occupied territories.
4. Ukraine's conflict stems from 2013. Our conflict stems from 1988 or even 1918.

For the Armenians that are frustrated with how the world has united behind Ukraine while they didn't for Armenia, they need to recognize that we're not as important and our conflict isn't as simple as Ukraine's. Ukraine is the classic underdog against the aggressive oppressor. It's easy to paint Ukraine as the innocent victim and Russia as the evil perpetrator. Our conflict is more complex and obscure, and both sides have blood on their hands. 

Outsiders will never care about our plight as much as they do Ukraine's. But that doesn't mean we can't use this situation. Our goal is to develop supporters and allies to promote Armenia despite the complexities of our situation. Don't get frustrated. Don't despair. Don't bitterly complain. Instead, use the opportunity to educate. 

There hasn't been a time in recent history when so many people in Europe and North America understand that war is not the answer to conflict as now. This includes Armenia's conflict. Use this time to educate your friends, family and colleagues. For those that focus on domestic concerns, point out to them that the world is far larger.  For those hesitant to support any side in a conflict, tell them to side with the innocent civilians. 

As always, we need to fight for our nation. Every day, we should wake up asking what we can do to support Armenia. That's our role. That's our moral responsibility."

12/28/2022,"A few reasons why many people in ""the West"" support Armenia rather than Azerbaidjan in the current conflict.","Hi! 

I'm French, and I saw that one of the top post on this sub is called ""why is the world against us?"". I wanted to give some insight into why people in Western Europe (at least France, but I think this also applies to neighboring countries) don't really support Azerbaidjan in its conflict with Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. I don't fully agree with all of this, but these are the main perceptions of the conflict in France.

. As you might know, France has a big Armenian diaspora which is viewed quite positively by other French people, so their point of view is quite well known. I would say here a few factors that explain why people mostly support Armenia in the current conflict.

\- Azerbaidjan is authoritarian, while the Armenian government, although far from being perfect, is more democratic. We instinctively tend to support a more ""liberal"" government, simply because they respect human rights a bit more. We feel that the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is a nationalistic project that is driven by the dictator Aliyev to distract from economic and social issues.

\- Simply put, Nagorno-Karabakh is mostly populated by people that feel Armenian, and therefore want to be their own independent state or join Armenia. I know that some Azeri people were expelled from this territory (and from the rest of Armenia too), but Armenians in Azerbaijan also had to flee their country in the 1990's, so there is is the idea that both sides committed pretty much the same ""ethnic cleansing"". Nowadays however, it is clear that Nagorno-Karabakh is ethnically Armenian, so why should it be Azeri?

\- The Armenians have suffered from many oppressions historically, especially the genocide by the Ottoman Empire, so it is seen as unfair that their territory should again be threatened.

\- The current tactic of using fake ""environmental activists"" to block the only road that leads into Nagorno-Karabakh is seen as particularly scummy, especially since it is causing the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to suffer from shortages of essential goods. No one here believes that the road blockers are genuine environmental activists, we believe that they are being paid by the government. I don't know what people in Azerbaidjan think.

\- Azerbaidjan is allied with Turkey, and Erdogan is clearly seen as an increasingly islamist dictator who is creating trouble in Southern Europe. Also, Turkey keeps denying the Armenian Genocide and funds the violent nationalist ""Grey Wolves"" throughout Europe. That is not helping us to feel sympathetic towards the Azeri government.

Here it is. I understand that there might be a bit more nuance to all of this, but this is what most French people who know about the conflict (which is not the majority) think about it. I'd be glad to hear some Azeri points of view on this, but please be civil.

Also please don't think that Western Europeans spend all of their time hating Azeris, we have nothing against the people, the main problem seems to be the government.

Thanks, I hope this can be useful for Azeri people to understand a foreign perception of the conflict."

8/4/2020,Why has Armenia generally come off the better in the Armenian-Azerbaijan Conflict?,"It's my understanding that Armenia has generally come off better than Azerbaijan in the conflict between the two countries. The major war between them resulted in a near total Armenian victory, and since then the Armenians have at the very least been able to hold their own

On paper, Armenia has significant disadvantages in this conflict. Both Azerbaijan's population and GDP are significantly larger than Armenia's. Armenia is also relatively isolated in a diplomatic sense, with Azerbaijan and its ally Turkey and friendly neighbor Iran nearly surrounding Armenia. Azerbaijan has more money and diplomatic access to modern weapon systems, while Armenia is still relying  in large numbers on Soviet era equipment

Why was Armenia able to win such a major victory in the initial war with Azerbaijan, and how have they been able to maintain their strong position in the years since despite numerous on-paper disadvantages?"

4/5/2023,Key facts on the incident: Azerbaijani government agents (“eco”-terrorists) yesterday blocked the movement of 27 Artsakh civilians from Armenia to Artsakh,"1. The civilian group, comprised mostly of women, elderly and children, was taken from Goris city in Armenia with two vehicles of Russian peacekeepers to reunite with their families.

2. They were stuck in Armenia due to the ongoing Artsakh blockade, which has already lasted for 115 days.

3. They were stopped at the point of the Artsakh blockade near Shushi by Azerbaijani government agents (“eco”-terrorists).

4. For over five hours, Russian peacekeepers negotiated with the Azerbaijani side to open the road for the group, but no success was achieved.

5. The Azerbaijanis intimidated the people in the vehicles by breaking into one of the cars and using threats.

6. They put forward pre-conditions for giving access: to “accept Azerbaijani citizenship” and to check everyone.

7. Twenty-three out of the 27 people returned to Goris at night without having access to their homeland.

8. As a result of Azerbaijani intimidation, the health situation of four women sharply worsened, and three of them fainted.

9. The accompanying peacekeepers called an ambulance and transferred those four to the Stepanakert hospital with Russian and Azerbaijani vehicles. 

10. The Azerbaijani side did not allow peacekeepers to bring and use the Artsakh ambulance and attempted to transfer the patients to the Shushi hospital under Azerbaijani control. However, the people protested and demanded that the patients be transferred to Stepanakert instead.

11. This is another manifestation of the Azerbaijani full blockade of Artsakh, and they block especially the entrance to the Artsakh people, not only while traveling with their own cars but often with Russian peacekeepers and Red Cross accompaniment, as it happened yesterday.

12. They sometimes create less obstacles to exit, as Aliyev stated on January 10, because their apparent purpose is to make ethnic cleansing of the Artsakh people.

13. The Aliyev dictatorial regime ignores not only the 2020 November 9 trilateral statement but also the binding order of the UN International Court of Justice to ensure unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo along the Lachin Corridor in both directions.

14. With the state policy of racial/ethnic discrimination and hatred in Azerbaijan and its regular manifestations, the international community should understand the level of existential threats against the Artsakh people under any kind of Azerbaijani control.

15. The ongoing blockade and hatred-motivated periodic crimes and psychological terror by Azerbaijan, as well as the failure of the international community to effectively protect the Artsakh people and prevent new crimes, require urgent, strong, and practical steps to ensure the proper protection of the security and rights of the Artsakh people, including the right to self-determination."

8/29/2023,Azerbaijan Kidnaps 3 Armenian Students (Artsakh Citizens) At Lachin Corridor En Route To Armenia From Artsakh To Attend University In Yerevan,"Azerbaijan troops illegally kidnap three young Armenian civilians & students traveling to Armenia from Artsakh accompanied by Russian Peacekeepers through the Berdzor (Lachin) Corridor on the Hakari bridge, reports Artsakh's Information Center & Arman Tatoyan, Armenia's Former Human Rights Defender.

The three Armenians in their early 20s were traveling to Armenia to continue their education at a university in Yerevan when they were kidnapped using force by Azeri border guards at the illegally installed Azerbaijani checkpoint on the Hakari bridge.

Azerbaijan has accused the three Artsakh citizens, Allen Sargsyan, Vahe Hovsepyan and Levon Grigoryan, of ""offensive acts against the Azerbaijani flag' in

The three students were among 170 others being transferred by Russian peacekeepers from Artsakh to Armenia on August 28.

Azerbaijan continues its genocidal policy towards the people of Artsakh, once again violating the norms of international humanitarian law.

""It is clear that the appetite of the Azerbaijani authorities is just opening. Where are the false peace preachers? Nothing to say? Not even any international guarantee is functional in the case of Azerbaijan,"" said Arman Tatoyan, Director of the Tatoyan Foundation and Armenia's former Human Rights Defender, on Facebook.

Tatoyan added, ""This act is committed with absolute arbitrariness; an unlawful deprivation of a person's liberty and kidnapping, a criminal act. These acts are committed within the ongoing fascist Armenophobic policies of Azerbaijani authorities. This is what happens when you sacrifice your rights, your dignity, and other vital rights for political interests when the primary issues in the country are after the secondary and even the tertiary issues, or whether even the primary issues have a place at all."""

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

> - US Department of State in-depth [discussion of conflict resolution](https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/averting-all-out-war-nagorno-karabakh).

> - Entities backing the OSCE peace plan: [UN General Secretary](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign), [EU High Rep Foreign Affairs](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell),  [NATO Sec. General](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), [Council of Europe Sec. General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict).

**Human Rights Ombudsman:** The village Sarnaghbyur of Askeran district had a population of 76 before the attack. Azerbaijan has killed 5, wounded 15, and taken captive 4 residents of the village. 

3 of the killed were children: [Nver Ghazaryan](https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/269910), Mikayel Ghazarian, David Alexanyan.

##exodus begins 

Russian peacekeepers escorted over 1,500 Armenians out of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday. Another 10,000 have become homeless and could soon join them. The rest of the population will be allowed to move as well, said the government of Nagorno-Karabakh.

**DAVID BABAYAN, adviser to NK president:** The fate of our poor people will go down in history as a disgrace and a shame for the civilized world. Those responsible for our fate will one day have to answer before God for their sins. 

**REFUGEE FROM STEPANAKERT:** I can't describe how terrible the situation was. Stores have been empty. We've been hungry for a year. Long lines. The last few days have been horrible. So many deaths and bombings. I don't want to see Azeri faces ever again. I had to leave my sons behind. One of them [possibly a soldier] went to the forests. He came down yesterday but had to stay behind to bury his friend. My younger son is still in Stepanakert with his children. I don't have any relatives in Armenia, no place to stay, but I've heard the government plans to distribute housing and aid.

##Azerbaijan disconnects Stepanakert's electric grid from Armenia 

The electricity was cut off a while ago. It was connected to the Azerbaijani grid on Sunday. The residents of some districts reported receiving electricity. The Azerbaijani regime disconnected the supply of vital energy sources 10 months ago in an attempt to subjugate the local population. The gas flow is still blocked. No electricity in the vast majority of the republic.

##Pashinyan's Sunday speech: Azerbaijan AND Russia will be responsible for ethnic cleansings if no conditions are created for Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians to continue to live in their homes

**PASHINYAN:** The attacks by Azerbaijan against Armenia over the past few years have made it *obvious* that [our defense partnership with Russia] is ineffective. This was visible in 2020, May and November of 2021, September 2022, and the list goes on.

The December 2020 invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh villages Khtsaberd and Hin Tagher and the capturing of over 60 Armenian soldiers, the Parukh incidents, the numerous examples of terror against Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, the illegal blockade of the Lachin corridor, Azerbaijan's September 19 attack on Nagorno-Karabakh, are all raising serious questions about the purpose and motives of deploying Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. 

Despite the Nov. 9 tripartite statement, Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh are still facing ethnic cleansings. The entry of a small amount of humanitarian aid in recent days does not change the situation. If no real conditions are created for Armenians to continue to live in their homes, they will have no option but to leave their homeland. The full responsibility will be on Azerbaijan and the Russian peacekeepers. 

Armenia is working with international partners to form an international mechanism for the protection of the rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. But if this effort fails, Armenia is ready to host the refugees.

Armenia has always followed its allied responsibilities and has never betrayed [Russia]. But the analysis of events shows that [Russia is trying to prove that Armenia cannot be an independent state]. And this has absolutely nothing to do with the 2018 revolution in Armenia and its outcome. We have seen [steps by Russia to prove Armenia cannot be independent] over the past few decades. The 2016 war and several other events took place in this context.

We have never agreed with the formulations questioning the independence of Armenia. But it's concerning that instead of accepting our will to be free and democratic, [Russia] has instead chosen to make Armenia more vulnerable, and now also by endangering our internal security. They have violated diplomatic and interstate ethics in addition to ignoring contractual obligations. 

In response to these actions, we urge [Russia] to respect Armenia's statehood and sovereignty, and we express our resolute will to strengthen our sovereignty, democracy, and internal and external security. 

We urge the international community to support Armenia's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and democracy. We will take any step to defend our independence. For this, it is necessary to change, supplement, and enrich Armenia's internal and external security mechanisms, by cooperating with all partners who wish to support us. 

We made the decision to ratify the Rome Statue in December 2022 after it became clear to everyone that the CSTO and our defense agreement with Russia are insufficient for defending Armenia. The ratification of the Rome Statute should not be viewed as a step against Russia. It is necessary for strengthening our defense. It is our sovereign right. 

Armenia must be a peaceful, developed, happy, and democratic state. To get there, we must first reaffirm our will to have an independent and sovereign state, and that is the path we have chosen while respecting [Russia] and while expecting [Russia] to respect our choice as well.  

Will Armenia will be a free and democratic state, or will it become a [remote region of Russia]? Every Armenian citizen must decide now. This is what's at stake [on the streets of Yerevan] today. 

As the prime minister of Armenia, I lead the movement for independence. If I weren't the prime minister, I would have done so as a regular citizen. Armenia's future depends on you and me. //

##8 arrested under the suspicion of organizing an assassination attempt against PM Pashinyan and usurpation of power

One of them is Albert Bazeyan who served as the mayor of Yerevan in 1999-2001 and Parliament VP in 1996-1999.

NSS says the group called ""Military-Patriotic Crusaders"" had obtained equipment and weapons to carry out killings and forcefully hijack power.

##U.S. will continue its unwavering support for Armenia's sovereignty and territorial integrity: Anthony Blinken 

Blinken and Pashinyan spoke over the phone. They discussed the rights and security of the Nagorno-Karabakh population and the internal situation in Armenia.

##interview with Armenia's Parliament President Alen Simonyan || The ceasefire document || Threats from Russia

**REPORTER:** Are you in touch with the Nagorno-Karabakh government?

**ALEN:** Frequently. Although they have long been independent of us.  

**REPORTER:** Your colleague from Nagorno-Karabakh says Pashinyan was informed beforehand about the [September 9] presidential election in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**ALEN:** Obviously information was transferred but Stepanakert didn't even ask for advice. It was for informational purposes only. We all understood that the process organized in Stepanakert would be viewed as a provocation by Baku, but the former regime decided to proceed anyway.

**REPORTER:** The Nagorno-Karabakh government also claims Pashinyan was informed about the NK-AZ ceasefire agreement in advance.

**ALEN:** They showed us the document but we didn't have any input. Over the phone, Pashinyan had expressed his concern and called it unacceptable that a paragraph was included about the supposed presence of soldiers from Armenia. The Nagorno-Karabakh government responded by saying that they don't plan on signing it - it will be a statement only. 

**REPORTER:** Did Pashinyan warn Stepanakert not to change the president because that would destabilize the situation?

**ALEN:** We did not make any demands that could be perceived as a forceful intervention. Nagorno-Karabakh was already aware of the situation very well. It was actually them who informed us about Azerbaijani threats. Nagorno-Karabakh had a more frequent and direct contact with Azerbaijan with the help of peacekeepers. 

**REPORTER:** People who organized the resignation of the Nagorno-Karabakh president are currently protesting on the streets of Yerevan, calling for Pashinyan's resignation.

**ALEN:** The organizers of these protests are foreign forces. But our compatriots have already rejected them. That's why the protests attract only 5,000 participants. I respect the participants but I'd like to urge them not to become a tool in the hands of a 3rd country [Russia] who doesn't have Armenia's interests in mind. Russia needs Turkey and its economic routes.

**REPORTER:** What happened near Nagorno-Karabakh's Khtsaberd village shortly after the 2020 ceasefire?

**ALEN:** In line with the Nov. 9 statement, Armenian forces remained in their positions in a strip near Khtsaberd. A few days later, Russian peacekeepers approached and told them to leave the area. These are our soldiers who later became captives. We called the peacekeepers to understand what was happening. They made some confusing statements and claimed the order to leave was given by Armenians. We requested the names. They didn't provide any. Many of these soldiers are still held captive in Azerbaijan.

That was just one incident in which Russia didn't help Armenia despite there not being any Prague or Brussels meetings yet. It's just an excuse not to help. The Russian media is peddling a misleading narrative to blame Armenia for everything.

It is our government's fault for putting up with their repeated excuses for 3 years, begging them for 3 years, and losing lands and soldiers for 3 years while attempting to sort things out with them. You can't blame us now for taking alternative measures to defend our country.

Russia is attempting to legitimize Azerbaijan's aggression against Armenia proper. When Azerbaijan attacked Nagorno-Karabakh on September 19th, Russia released a statement calling for Azerbaijan and Armenia to exercise restraint. Do you understand what they are trying to do? They are attempting to frame Armenia as a party in that war so they can legitimize Azerbaijan's future attack on Armenia. What SIDES are they talking about? Your peacekeepers are stationed there, witnessing how people are being murdered in 15 directions. Azerbaijan launched the aggression with artillery strikes in 15 directions. 

**REPORTER:** What is the current situation on the AM-AZ border? There were reports of large Azerbaijani accumulations earlier this month.

**ALEN:** Part of their soldiers have been pulling back. The situation is de-escalating.

**REPORTER:** [about EU border observers]

**ALEN:** We invited EU observers on the AM-AZ border after Azerbaijan's aggression [and Russia's refusal to help]. The observers helped to sharply de-escalate the situation. I'd like to thank the countries that sent the observers.

My Russian colleague, the Speaker of the Russian Duma, later met the Azeri counterpart and openly announced that countries that invite European observers cease to exist. It was an open threat by a ranking Russian official against Armenia. //

The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Nov 4 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 50 civilian killed, 148 wounded and 19000 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

> - US Department of State in-depth [discussion of conflict resolution](https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/averting-all-out-war-nagorno-karabakh).

> - Entities backing the OSCE peace plan: [UN General Secretary](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign), [EU High Rep Foreign Affairs](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell),  [NATO Sec.

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) and using [mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the indigenous Armenian population of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has severely damaged 130 civilian settlements including the capital Stepanakert with aerial, drones, missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic and artillery means as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of October 16, Azerbaijan's violence has resulted in: A total of 36 civilians have been killed - a little girl, 7 women and 28 men. A total of 115 people were wounded, of which 95 received serious injuries: 77 of them are male and 18 are female citizens. Severe damage inflicted upon civilians properties: 7800 private immovable properties, 720 private movable properties, 1310 infrastructure, public and industrial objects including [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html). Over 700 Armenian military personnel and volunteers have also been killed, making the KIA per capita higher than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE led by the US, France and Russia, and backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe, among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The European Parliament passed a [resolution in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20) supporting the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with the Armenia SSR.

> - The four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) call for cease of hostilities and mandate the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions followed the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above applies to the only existing non-binding [UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The majority of UN members states abstained from voting in favour of said resolution.

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

> - US Department of State in-depth [discussion of conflict resolution](https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/averting-all-out-war-nagorno-karabakh).

> - Entities backing the OSCE peace plan: [UN General Secretary](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign), [EU High Rep Foreign Affairs](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell),  [NATO Sec.

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Nov 4 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 50 civilian killed, 148 wounded and 19000 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict).

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Nov 4 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 50 civilian killed, 148 wounded and 19000 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict).

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) and using [mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has severely damaged 130 civilian settlements including the capital Stepanakert with aerial, drones, missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic and artillery means as well [the use](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of October 16, Azerbaijan's violence has resulted in: A total of 36 civilians have been killed - a little girl, 7 women and 28 men. A total of 115 people were wounded, of which 95 received serious injuries: 77 of them are male and 18 are female citizens. Severe damage inflicted upon civilians properties: 7800 private immovable properties, 720 private movable properties, 1310 infrastructure, public and industrial objects including [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html). Over 700 Armenian military personnel and volunteers have also been killed, making the KIA per capita higher than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE led by the US, France and Russia, and backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe, among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The European Parliament passed a [resolution in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20) supporting the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with the Armenia SSR.

> - The four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) call for cease of hostilities and mandate the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions followed the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above applies to the only existing non-binding [UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The majority of UN members states abstained from voting in favour of said resolution.

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Nov 4 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 50 civilian killed, 148 wounded and 19000 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict).

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Nov 4 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 50 civilian killed, 148 wounded and 19000 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict).

Then the war broke out in Israel and now I’m conflicted on whether I can morally support them. [To be crystal clear, kidnapping and murdering innocent, helpless civilians including the elderly, women and children is absolutely evil. I feel so much pain for those Israelis and hope they will have peace soon. I also believe they have an absolute right to defend and fight back.] 

My conflict is about whether Armenians can and should support Israel on the international arena if what the AP is reporting is true? What are your thoughts? I always thought Armenia and Israel were friendly, I know there are many Armenians living in Israel and vice versa. But I was disturbed when I learned how friendly Israel is with Az.

I am a gentile non-Israeli, but I support Israel strongly, I believe it has been a moral, just and legal country from the very beginning and I think Golan and Judea and Samaria belong to Israel legally and ethically, but I still have some issues against it, like

1. Ben Gvir and his fellow racist supremacist party members who stand against everything Israel was founded upon, and the fact that Israel doesn't have a constitution banning ilk like him from coming into government

2. The government endorsing thugs who build illegal outposts on literally stolen land owned by Palestinians because of extremist supremacist beliefs (I am not talking about proper settlements that have been legal by Israel for decades)

3. IDF soldiers having a taboo against hindering violence from Jews targeted at innocent Palestinians, they should be equally hindering escalation from both sides, and hinder jew raids on Palestinians from happening. It's impossible to justify videos of IDF soldiers just standing there and looking while extremists are hurting others.

4. Recently, Israel should NOT have blocked their supply of water to the Gaza strip. Hamas are animals who WILL kill/sacrifice the entire population of Gaza for their ideology, they will never surrender for water, and the remaining water will be prioritised towards soldiers, leaving civilians to die. Blocking electricity is justified, as it's helping Hamas a lot, and asking civilians to evacuate only up to 10 km away in 24 hours is imo a perfectly reasonable and good thing, but water is such a vital resource to life and life only, not war, so it boggles my mind that Israel has decided to block it.

5. Supporting Azerbaijan. It's obvious Israel does this as a move against Iran, ignoring the moral element and forsaking the budding fellow Oriental democracy of Armenia against a nation ruled by dictatorship instructing its children to hate, like the Palestinian Authority does

I look forward to hearing what both sides have to say, and I hope that this can be a productive nuanced discussion"
10/17/2020,[World] - Nagorno-Karabakh: Civilians hit amid Armenia Azerbaijan conflict,
11/1/2020,Message to Azeris lurking here.,"According to The World Bank database, the GDP per capita of Azerbaijan is $4,793.5 (2019).

In comparison, Armenia's GDP per capita is $4,622.7.

The gap is really small, considering that Azerbaijan is an oil-rich country, with a large area, vast natural resources, support from Turkey, direct borders with Russia, Georgia, and Iran.

Armenia is a land-locked country with closed borders on west and east, poor natural resources, no border with the main export destination - Russia. 

Don't you have anything to ask Aliyev? 

A sample text would be ""Hello, Aliyev, where is our money going? Why are we as rich per capita as that bastard Armenians?"" or ""Why are your children so wealthy when we struggle with our lives?"" 

If you are not ""asking"" its government where all the money goes, there is only one scapegoat for all the troubles in the country - and that is Armenia. 

Each dollar spent on drones to kill civilians or burn forests could be a dollar spent to create infrastructures, increase spending on science, increase pensions, better schools, etc.  But besides each dollar spent on the military, I hope you realize how much money is laundered. 

I exactly understand your sentiments for the lost lands.  And I don't know whether there is a way to ever build peace in our region, and acknowledge the existence and right to live and prosper for all nations, from both sides. 

But I know if things run the same, and hypothetically, Armenia stops existing, your problems will remain unsolved."

A truck carrying small quantities of food and blankets entered via Agdam on Tuesday and reached the capital Stepanakert with the permission of the newly elected Nagorno-Karabakh government and Azerbaijani government. Russia hopes that the Lachin corridor will also open soon and work parallel to Agdam.

The Lachin corridor, the lifeline connecting to Armenia, remains closed to Armenian and French aid and the unobstructed passage of civilians despite the orders by the World Court for Azerbaijan to open it.

The Azerbaijani government has stated that, after holding talks with the U.S. and others, they will support the idea of opening the Lachin and Agdam roads simultaneously for Armenian and Azerbaijani Red Cross aid. The approval of the Russian Red Cross to send a truck today is unrelated to the main issue, which is the entry of Armenian and Azerbaijani Red Cross trucks via Lachin and Agdam.

It is unclear whether Azerbaijan will also allow the unobstructed movement of civilians, a demand made by the World Court and Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, many of whom have relatives trapped on the other side of the border, school and business ties in Armenia, all of which have become inaccessible due to Azerbaijan's illegal blockade of the corridor.

Azerbaijan has also shut down the gas and electricity in Nagorno-Karabakh for several months, forcing ethnic Armenians to use wood to survive the winter. There is not enough fuel to deliver essential goods to residents in the regions. 

Kindergartens are shutting down. Water is delivered in buckets. The garbage is not being collected. Food is strictly rationed by the government and involves lengthy queues.

##Vladimir Putin downplays the crisis in Armenia-Russia relations: We have great relations with Armenia and PM Pashinyan 

Putin said that for 10-15 years they've tried to convince the Armenian governments to hand over 5 of the 7 surrounding regions to Azerbaijan but the Armenian side chose to ""fight"".

This contradicts other Russian officials' claims and the history of the negotiations because Azerbaijan was the one that rejected the surrender of 5 regions in exchange for an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh.

Putin also stated that the status of Nagorno-Karabakh has already been settled because Armenia recognizes Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, and that the remaining issues are around the humanitarian situation and the mandate of peacekeeping forces. 

Putin said there is also the issue of not allowing ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh. He ""hopes"" that the Azerbaijani government will ""keep its word"" and prevent ethnic cleansings. *[just like the Nov. 9 promises?]*

Putin blamed Armenia for the Lachin blockade: *""Armenia has recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan.""* Read Armenia's response to this accusation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/166ppv0/armenia_accuses_russia_of_ignoring_commitments/). Armenia says Russia is simply looking for excuses to deflect the blame because it ignores its own Nov. 9 obligations around Lachin.

Solovyov also expressed hope that Georgia and Armenia would burst into flames and fall, giving Russia a land corridor to Iran.

##15 French cities have officially recognized the Artsakh Republic
 
15 mayors released a joint statement of their recognition of Artsakh and urged the French government to follow suit.
 
**The message:** Azerbaijan involved Syrian jihadists and caused a humanitarian crisis in Artsakh, in violation of international conventions. The capital and other settlements were bombarded. Civilians were killed. Thousands had to flee.
 
Although the November 10th agreement isn't favorable, it put an end to the bloodshed. Artsakh's land losses can lead to critically bad conditions for Artsakh's historical-cultural monuments from the 4th, 8th, and 10th centuries.
 
France cannot hide behind a neutral stance anymore. That would mean supporting the Azeri aggression. We need to reaffirm our full support to the friendly people and support their return to their ancestral lands.
 
Artsakh held elections in 1991 and chose independence and has ever since been able to provide internal stability with institutes and democratic processes. Having completed all the components of a state recognized by international law, Artsakh must be recognized as a sovereign state that belongs to the Artsakh people.

**European Parliament MP Ivan David:** a genocide was committed in Karabakh. I've seen a video recorded by Azeris themselves on how they killed civilians and POWs. They also destroyed civilian infrastructure, which is a war crime.
 
Europe looked and did nothing. Some European states supplied weapons to the barbarian wing to secure its victory, all in the name of petrodollars. Europe kneeled before Azeri oil.
 
The youth will eventually wonder why they should answer for the dirty actions of today's administration. They will decide what Europe's mission is in this world.
 
Thankfully, there are many in Europe who realize the situation. They understand that Turkey's ultimate goal is to conquer Europe.
 
There should be an international tribunal to investigate Karabakh events. Let's see how the European Parliament responds to it. Our Identity & Democracy party members also support it. If none of the major three parties vetoes it, it will be discussed in the European Parliament.

##the army general gives context and details before and during the war
 
**Armenian Army's General Chief of Staff Onik Gasparyan released a statement [he, along with Artsakh's army commanders, were in charge]:** the soldiers fought selflessly from the very beginning. Certain public figures claim that the army command mislead the government with wrong analysis by under-estimating the opponent's capabilities. This is false.
 
I took the office on June 8th and presented the Security Council and the PM my analysis of the regional military-political situation. I suggested improving the army. This was my analysis:
 
1) Azerbaijan is no longer our only opponent. Turkey is involved. We cannot resist their combined aggression. We need political steps to prevent a war.
 
2) The government accepted my advice and asked ""If we cannot avoid a war politically, what can be done?"". My answer was ""we'd need to deal a heavy blow on the enemy troops as quickly as possible and force them to end their hostifilites"". I noted that Armenia needs to avoid lengthy wars due to a lack of resources. We discussed many ways to improve our army; the suggestions were accepted.
 
3) We also discussed the plans to create the new Volunteer Army consisted of 100,000 people.
 
We were unable to avoid the war which led to a much larger enemy's aggression on September 27th. We were dealing heavy blows and repelling the opponent, but we were also sustaining heavy casualties.
 
On the 4th day, I presented our losses and suggested ending the was within 3 days, otherwise, if the intensity of the battles remained the same, our resources would expire quickly and we'd have worse negotiation terms.
 
Our attempts to stop the war were rejected by Turkey and Azerbaijan. and we were forced to continue the war. We attempted to cause heavy damage to the enemy to convince them to stop and to return to the negotiation table.
 
The unfavorable Document was signed after a comprehensive assessment of the situation. We had to choose between ""very bad"" and ""tragedy"". We chose the lesser of the evil.
 
We shouldn't be depressed now, knowing that we saved part of Artsakh and the army's main potential. We need to regroup and prepare to continue the struggle.
 
As the general commander, I carry responsibility for all successes and failures of our army. We were forced into a brutal war but our soldiers fought until the end despite the unequal forces. The nation should be proud of its soldier.
  
&nbsp
 
**OP David's personal analysis:** back in June, even before the July battles, [Azerbaijan was already boasting](https://www.trtworld.com/turkey/azerbaijan-to-purchase-combat-drones-from-turkey-37493) about importing Turkish Bayraktar drones. The Armenian army knew that Turkey was plotting something. Onik Gasparyan predicted Turkey's possible involvement even before the drone news reached the media.
 
When the war began, the army told Pashinyan that they’ll try to force Azeris to stop by inflicting heavy casualties. Pashinyan made multiple public speeches reflecting the army's strategy, saying ""we must stop this war by forcing Azeris to return to negotiating table"".
 
The army was concerned about the severity of the war in the first week, and wanted to stop within 3 days, but possibly revised the decision when the intensity subsided down afterward. The army has stated many times that the battles weren't as heavy anymore. The army decided to keep fighting to force Azeris to stop and return to the negotiation table.
 
At this time, Armenians could have accepted a defeat and give 7 regions to Azerbaijan, but they thought they could force Azeris to be the ones to stop first, so Armenia would have a better negotiating power.

When Armenians realized they can't succeed, they decided to give the regions, but by then, Azerbaijan also demanded Shushi, so Armenians said ""if we're gonna lose it all then we might as well fight and try to keep Shushi"". Fast forward to Shushi. Armenians lost the city and were forced to sign the ceasefire to prevent further loss.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1035102.html
 
 
 
##Vladimir Putin gives more details about Shushi / negotiations / Pashinyan
 
While the war was happening in the south, Russia asked Pashinyan if it's OK to [essentially repopulate] Shushi by bringing the Azeri refugees who used to live there [Shushi area was heavily populated by Azeris during USSR]. Shushi would de-jure remain under Artsakh control but Azeri civilians would be settled there. Pashinyan rejected the offer on security grounds. Putin and Aliyev were in favor of that deal.
 
""Pashinyan told me that he sees a direct threat to Artsakh interests [with Azeri population in Shushi] although I don't understand what the threat would be,"" said Putin. 

&nbsp;

""The agreement was drafted and signed within a day. Every word and every comma was being debated."" *[there goes all the conspiracy theories that Nikol knew ahead of time, Nikol already brought peacekeepers x days ago, yadda yadda]*
 
&nbsp;
 
Putin denied the claim that he has bad relations with Pashinyan and that it lead to this situation. ""I haven't noticed any problems with relations with Armenia in recent times, including in the period when Pashinyan became the Prime Minister.""
 
&nbsp;
 
""If Armenia walked back the signed document, that would be a suicide.""

""Allegations of treason by Pashinyan are baseless,"" he added.
 
&nbsp;
 
""The status of Nagorno Karabakh hasn't been clarified. Moscow preserves the status quo. If good relations are established between Armenia and Azerbaijan, it will be possible to solve the Status issue.""
 
""When the Georgian government attacked our peacekeepers, Russia recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. We also recognized the fair aspiration of the Crimean population to join Russia, so we recognized it, we supported them openly. We did that for the best interest of the Crimean residents and Russia. In the case of Karabakh, this did not happen, which certainly had a significant impact on what has happened,"" said Putin. [does Vlad want Karabakh?]

##November 17 / political turmoil continues
 
**10:48:** oppo BHK party wants today's Parliamentary session to be only about Pashinyan's resignation and the suspension of the ongoing Martial Law. Oppo LHK wants to hold a new session specifically for lifting the Martial Law.
 
There were very few ruling QP MPs, too, so no voting was held despite some Q&As. The Finance Minister spoke about dedicating funds for Artsakh refugees.
 
&nbsp;
 
During the session, ruling QP MP Andranik Kocharyan called for Defense Minister Tonoyan's resignation, criticizing him and another defense official who has already been fired. The MP listed several ""mistakes by the military between 2016-2020"".
 
The MP has been heavily criticizing certain army officials since yesterday. He was asked to clarify if he recently ""terrorized"" a Colonel during a meeting. The MP responded:

""Terrorize who? That so-called Colonel Koryun Yeghiazaryan, whom I refer to as Serj's Koryun, who used to be Vazgen Manukyan's chauffeur and used to terrorize the public? President Serj Sargsyan liked them so much that made them part of his administration.
 
These and several militarymen were ruling the country. We've seen videos of HHK MP Shmays, along with the said Colonel, choking demonstrators. They have no quality. They weren't sent to retirement because of 'connections'.
 
Yesterday I met the Colonel. He was asked about the weapons under his possession. I asked him which positions he commanded during the war.""

**11:39:** the police told everyone to calm down and not to provoke each other.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1035095.html
 
**12:42:** oppo ARF party leader Gegham Manukyan said that several ARF members were detained and taken to SIS station for questioning yesterday, but the investigators allegedly told them ""there are no questions, we just need to keep you here for an hour so you won't participate in the rally"".
 
**The SIS responded:** Gegham Manukyan told his supporters during a rally that our agents allegedly kept them in a station just for the sake of not allowing them to participate in a rally. This is false. He and several others were invited for questioning. They were asked questions about their ongoing case. 
 
We urge media outlets not to spread misinformation. For example, hayeli.am [Roboserj] uploaded photos and claimed 13 investigators resigned. In reality, the agents continue to do their duties.

**13:05:** Pashinyan's office published a surveillance video of the rioters who broke into his residency and govt buildings on November 10th, to ""find"" Pashinyan and others. Parliament Speaker was heavily beaten. Some of the riot participants have been identified as:

Narek Mantashyan and Hovhannes Harutyunyan, leaders of a pro-Kocharyan movement, and former leaders of Economic University's Student Council.
 
**BHK MP and Tsarukyan's son-in-law Davit Manukyan responds:** I only went there [govt building] to calm the crowd. I did not participate in vandalism.

**13:08 ruling QP MP Sargsyan:** two of BHK Gagik Tsarukyan's son-in-laws, one of whom is an MP, removed the license plates from their luxury vehicles and drove to the government building on the night of November 10th [riot night]. 

As stated by witnesses, they brought with them a large group of people who vandalized the building.

**16:52:** recently-resigned army spokesman Artsrun Hovhannisyan says he's been receiving threats since November 9th and that two people physically attacked him yesterday.

##doctors during the war
 
Healthcare Minister Torosyan has thanked all the doctors, ""Your direct participation and contribution to the maintenance of the physical and mental health of our soldiers is invaluable. The medical community has shown a strong unity these days, consolidating all the potential under one idea - to save the Armenian soldier, volunteer, and civilian.""

The US has asked Russia to clarify Turkey's role during the peacekeeping mission. Russia agreed to discuss.

##telecom and airways reform in Armenia / TV outlets competing for slots
 
Earlier this year, the government approved a law to regulate hateful/gore content on public TV, to require news outlets to present both sides of the story, etc. It also prioritizes Armenian-language content broadcasted over the free public airways.
 
In order for foreign outlets to continue to broadcast foreign-language content for free, they have to negotiate on certain terms. Today the TV regulator negotiated with Russia and signed an agreement to allocate 1-2 public airway slots for Russian channels.
 
Foreign TV channels do not have to compete. They receive a fixed slot per interstate agreement.
 
Overall, Armenian TV outlets are competing for 25 airway frequency slots: 12 outlets are competing for 6 countrywide slots, 4 are competing for 9 slots in Yerevan, 13 competing for 10 slots in provinces.
 
The winners will be known in January. ""The process is apolitical and those who provide the best programming will win the slots,"" said TV Regulator Tigran Hakobyan. 

Today six outlets will present their programming: TV5, ArmNews, H2, Kentron, Armenia, ATV. *[Most, if not all, are either fully or partly owned by the former regime's oligarchs].*

**Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

Recently the UK based Conciliation Resources released a documentary jointly produced by Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists. This is agreed to be the most neutral account of the conflict ever made, you can watch it online here: https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict

Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through Peace and War by Thomas de Waal is agreed to be the best book on the conflict: https://nyupress.org/9780814760321/black-garden/

**Is there a peace plan?**

Azerbaijan and the Armenian side have agreed in principle to the settlement process mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group co-chaired by the US, Russia and France with a mandate from the UN, which since 2009 has consisted of the following proposal:

 > The ministers of the US, France, and Russia presented a preliminary version of the Basic Principles for a settlement to Armenia and Azerbaijan in November 2007 in Madrid.

 > The Basic Principles reflect a reasonable compromise based on the Helsinki Final Act principles of Non-Use of Force, Territorial Integrity, and the Equal Rights and Self-Determination of Peoples.

 > The Basic Principles call for inter alia:

 >- return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control;

 >- an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

 >- a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

 >- future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

 >- the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and

 >- international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

 > The endorsement of these Basic Principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan will allow the drafting of a comprehensive settlement to ensure a future of peace, stability, and prosperity for Armenia and Azerbaijan and the broader region.

However there has been no meaningful progress in the negotiations, meanwhile the mediating group focusing on containing the conflict proposed to *harden the ceasefire regime* following the 2016 April ""four day war"" as well as following the [Armenian revolution of 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Armenian_revolution) made a proposal to the sides to *prepare the populations for peace*. 

[Thomas de Waal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_de_Waal):

> Russia, the US and the EU have enough tools to contain both sides, but they have neither the time, nor the energy, nor the desire to try to force Armenia and Azerbaijan to conclude peace, let alone send peacekeepers who will have to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

[Sergey Markedonov (Carnegie Moscow Center)](https://carnegie.ru/commentary/experts/1196):

> Russia is well aware that the search for compromises is the business of the Armenian and Azerbaijani sides. They are not ready for this, but no one will do this work for them.

**What disinformation is prevalent about this conflict?**

One of the most entrenched disinformations is that pertaining to the nature of the UN Security Council resolutions on the conflict. 

The UN Security Council resolutions concern with and recognise the invasions and occupations of the [*surrounding territories*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_Nagorno-Karabakh#:~:text=The%20Armenian%2Dcontrolled%20territories%20surrounding,of%20Artsakh%20supported%20by%20Armenia.) of Nagorno-Karabakh carried out by local Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh.

The UN Security Council resolutions 

1. do NOT recognise Republic of Armenia having invaded or occupied any territories, 

2. do NOT recognise Nagorno-Karabakh as occupied or invaded territory,

3. do NOT demand Republic of Armenia to withdraw forces from any territories,

4. do NOT demand any forces to be withdrawn from Nagorno-Karabakh.

Regarding Y.

Likewise, the US stayed silent when Armenia ignored the resolutions of the UN Security Council, committed acts of violence resulting in the deaths of more than 20,000 Azerbaijani civilians, wounding & torturing and mutilating more than 100,000 Azerbaijani civilians, destroyed more than 900 Azerbaijani settlements, contaminated a part of Azerbaijan's territory with mines, and refuses to clarify the fate of more than 4,000 Azerbaijanis it took hostage.

The fact that the US government, which is fully aware of all the intricacies of the relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia and the situation on the ground, turns a blind eye to so many injustices committed against Azerbaijanis and supports the baseless claims of Armenia is incompatible with the claimed role of the United States as a ""the global defender of human rights"" or as the partner for promoting peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

The USA, a nation that claims to value peace and justice, has yet to demand that Armenia withdraw the remnants of its army from the territories of Azerbaijan and disarm illegal Armenian armed groups. Whereas the United States unconditionally recognizes the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries in the post-Soviet space and opposes separatism, it is unacceptable that the United States is ambiguous when it comes to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. Y. Kim's commanding tone is also inappropriate and unacceptable. The State Department official has the wrong address. We remind Y. Kim that US politicians and diplomats raise the issue of American sovereignty everywhere. The sovereignty of Azerbaijan is no different from the sovereignty of any other country, including the United States, which Ms. Kim represents.

The US government should not be swayed by Armenia's manipulations, should not display ethnic bias when it comes to protection of human rights, should not interfere in the internal affairs of Azerbaijan, and must support the safe and dignified return of Azerbaijanis who were expelled from Armenia.

Armenia is living in extremely difficult days. There is sorrow in the hearts of all of us, tears in our eyes, and pain in the souls. The agreement to end the war, signed on November 10, caused public despair and raised many questions, to which I am expected to answer.

Why was such an unfavorable document signed? It happened in the conditions when the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia was reporting that the war should be stopped ASAP, and the Artsakh President was warning that if the hostilities continued, we could lose Stepanakert in days, in some scenarios, even in hours.

Some of you might say that if we already lost Hadrut, Shushi, we could have lost Stepanakert and not much would have changed. The reality is a little different, because if Stepanakert was lost, which, as Artsakh President Arayik Harutyunyan had already publicly confirmed would happen, then Askeran and Martakert would inevitably be lost.

In the beginning, these regions were located in the rear, quite far from the front lines, and did not have defensive structures and fortifications, and there were not enough fighting forces that could defend these areas.

This would lead to our 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7th defense zones being encircled, along with 20,000 soldiers who would either die or become POWs. Kalbajar and Qashatagh would also fall. There would be a total loss.

The most important function of the commander is to set tasks for the soldier, with a specific tactical or strategic goal. The commander sets these tasks often realizing that their implementation can lead to the death of soldiers. Being de-facto the Commander-in-Chief, I have set such tasks for the army.

But when a situation arises when a soldier can not in any way influence the further course of events, it is no longer the soldier who must die for the sake of the homeland, but the homeland must make sacrifices for the sake of the soldier.

With this in mind, I signed the infamous document. I realized that the probability of me being killed for signing it is very high but the lives of 25,000 soldiers were more important. The encircled soldiers would not have had enough force to make a breakthrough.

The decision had to be made within hours. We had no days and weeks.

Some of you are wondering why I didn't resign instead of signing it. Because that would be desertion on my part. That would mean shifting all the burden on someone else's shoulders, and today you would be calling me a hero and someone else a traitor. Also, the decision had to be made within hours.

The next question is why I didn't consult with the public before signing it. It's simple. I would have to give you the honest details and reveal all our weaknesses, while the battles continued, while the enemy was watching. That would have given them valuable info on how to encircle our troops.

Also, I promised to discuss with the public the options for the settlement of the Karabakh issue. This document does not completely end the conflict, but only a cessation of hostilities. The Karabakh issue was not resolved and is not resolved, and in this regard, there is still work to be done.

Why couldn't we prevent the war, or stop it at the initial phase, if the outcome was going to be similar? Because that would mean giving away 7 regions, including Shushi, without a fight. The second reason is we believed that by involving new military resources and hard work, we could make a breakthrough.

This is why Artsakh President and I had been making speeches with calls to enlist in the army. We had to do this in a way not to spread panic and demoralize our front line soldiers and without revealing our weaknesses to the enemy.

Everyone has done everything possible to save every inch. Our soldiers fought heroically. They fought to win and not give up. They fought against 3 armies.

Unfortunately, as Artsakh president said yesterday, we didn't help the army sufficiently. Volunteer and mobilized troops, of course with many heroic episodes, did not end up being strong enough to solve the problem. There was no other solution.

The agreement is bad for us but there is no need to make it worse. I've seen rumors about giving away Armenia's Meghri region, which is absolute nonsense. It's only about removing the transport blockade on Nakhijevan (Azerb.)

That also means we can connect Yerevan to Syunik province through Nakhijevan. We will be able to connect to Iran via railway, which will have a significant positive impact on our economy. [BTW, Turkey has already announced willingness to build a railway through Armenia to connect to Azerbaijan, so this idea looks serious.]

As for the part of Karabakh that will remain under Armenian control, we can connect to it via the Lachin corridor, including in the area near Shushi. Peacekeepers will also guarantee civilians security. It's important for refugees to return to their homes now. The government of Armenia and Artsakh will do everything to quickly recover the damage.

The issue of the final settlement of the Karabakh and the status of Artsakh is of fundamental importance. Artsakh's recognition is becoming an absolute priority and, in fact, there are more weighty arguments for the international recognition of Artsakh.

Within Armenia, we must have a stable environment. At this moment, we must ensure, first of all, that the people fully master their inalienable right to form a government, to have power. The government will not tolerate the violent provocations by the groups sponsored by the former regime. Many organizers are already under arrest. Others are in hiding.

I call on all our compatriots not to give in to provocations, and to unite around the government that is determined to help bring the country out of this situation, while guaranteeing that no one will seize power to plunder and return the country to a whirlpool of corruption.

We are reaping the bitter fruits of that robbery and corruption today. When for decades, the country's wealth had flowed into the pockets of familiar people and not to the development of the army.

Dear people, our country has a future, and we must do everything we can to make this cruel ordeal of ours an important cornerstone of that future. We as a nation will learn from the mistakes we have made.

Many will ask if we can talk about a good future after this brutal war. Yes, because there are some countries in the world today that have undergone the most brutal capitulations of the 20th century, but today are among the most powerful countries in the world.

They developed with an emphasis on education, science, industry, and democracy, and this should be our next step. And I urge all of us to focus on what we can do to strengthen our country. This will be our best service to the memory of our martyrs, our wounded and disabled servicemen and their families.

Of course, the families of the victims have to ask us a question: why did their relatives die in the end? The answer to this question is one: to save the people of Artsakh from genocide, to protect the right of the Armenian people to live. Our homage to them is the daily creative work and education that should improve our country.

Long live Freedom, Long live the Republic of Armenia, Long live the Republic of Artsakh. And long live our children who will live in a Free and Happy Armenia. I bow to our martyrs.

This leaves us with the question how Armenia should align if Russia becomes so weak that it loses it´s influence south of the Caucasus mountains. The strongest power after the collapse would be Turkey, obviously, considering that one of the four countries in the so-called South Caucasus is their puppet state. Iran would also gain influence, which would probably be beneficial for Armenia. Especially if a Iranian-Western detente comes into play due to the nuclear deal and the following gas exports.

As a supporter of the multi-vector foreign policy model, I would not choose any faction directly, as NATO will only accept Georgia anyway in the next decades and Turkey would veto any attempt to invite Armenia. Instead, cooperation with Iran, France, the US, India and the EU should be deepened rapidly. And a security guarantor would be needed to deny Turkey´s genocidal wishes.

Therefore, why didn’t Armenia do so and push for Russia (and the rest of the world) to recognize it so Artsakh could be protected by Russia and all of CSTO? If Russia refused, other allies such as NATO or Iran could’ve been explored as well, although unlikely due to Armenia being much more pro Russian back then than today. To me it seems like the total incompetency of all your governments for the last 30 years have led to this situation. It’s insane to me that Armenia didn’t at a minimum recognize the independence of Artsakh. Why would Russia or anyone else have helped you when your government refused to help their own people?"

According to the tripartite agreements signed by the leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia after the 2nd Karabakh War, there should be no armed units belonging to Armenia in Karabakh, but by continuing its military shipments to Karabakh, Armenia is behaving in violation of the agreements.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b69zciyp4bqa1.jpg?width=864&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9339e8699f80e624c1e198b9c15727106f7cec2b

&#x200B;

The increase in the transportation of manpower, ammunition, mines and military equipment from Armenia to the illegal Armenian armed groups in the territory of Azerbaijan, where the Russian forces are temporarily deployed, caused reactions in Azerbaijan.

&#x200B;

The Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan, by explaining the violations committed by the Armenians in Karabakh, day by day, showed its reaction and gave warnings.

&#x200B;

Since the only route known as the Lachin Corridor, which is the only route used by the Armenian population in Azerbaijan on their way to and from Armenia, is only open to civilian passages due to the protests of Azerbaijani environmentalists, Armenian forces are trying to make military shipments through mountain roads and to build new roads in mountainous areas.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvg25bts4bqa1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d84f80652ac11616cfe1ce2ae01e730da2ddcb6e

&#x200B;

As violations increased in March, clashes and loss of life occurred between the parties.

&#x200B;

On March 5, upon the information that military equipment, ammunition and personnel were transported from Armenia to the territories of Azerbaijan, where the Armenian population lives, using the Hankendi-Halfeli-Turşsu road, Azerbaijani soldiers took action.

&#x200B;

Clashes broke out after those in the vehicle opened fire on the Azerbaijani soldiers who wanted to stop the illegal military transport vehicle for control. In the conflict, 2 soldiers of the Azerbaijani army were martyred. The Armenian side announced that 3 police officers were killed in the clash.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w4d27vwx4bqa1.jpg?width=1562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=379f70e7642e9c9e0ada0ef5e2f4620a7cbf7ed1

&#x200B;

On March 7, military vehicles belonging to the Armenian armed forces and illegal Armenian armed groups, accompanied by Russian forces, made a shipment through Khankendi-Halfeli-Turşsu.

&#x200B;

On the same route, on March 11, Armenian forces accompanied the Russian forces. The shipment was recorded by the unmanned aerial vehicles of the Azerbaijani army.

&#x200B;

On March 21, the Ministry announced that Armenian forces carried out military shipments via Khankendi-Halfeli-Turşsu and announced that the responsibility for the tensions to be experienced in this situation lies with the Yerevan administration.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On March 24, it was determined that Armenian forces made a new road in the direction of Khankendi-Kosalar-Mirzeler-Turşsu to the north of the Khankendi-Halfeli-Turşsu road, and Azerbaijan also warned in this regard. In the warning, it was noted that the Russian troops in the region did not fulfill their obligations.

&#x200B;

When the warnings were not taken into account, Azerbaijan took some measures to prevent illegal armed forces in Karabakh from transporting manpower and weapons by using some dirt roads. Azerbaijani soldiers set up checkpoints on dirt roads where illegal shipments were made.

&#x200B;

In the statements made by Azerbaijan, Armenia was demanded to end its illegal activities in Karabakh, and the Russian forces were also asked to fulfill their obligations.

&#x200B;

Azerbaijan wants a checkpoint to be established on the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia, at the last point of the Lachin road, in order to prevent illegal activities in its territory.

She (or he) insists that wherever countries are attacked by others and the population on either side provides the material for it, there should actually always be a reason for the West to intervene, but - in the end ""unfortunately"" - not is. 

 On the other hand, the conclusion would have to be drawn that states are also concerned with something other than “helping attacked countries”. This is neither the reason for arms deliveries to Ukraine, nor is the lack of this humanism the reason for the absence of arms deliveries to Armenia.

 But most of them shouldn't even be outraged at the lack of reaction to the beginning war in the Caucasus. You have doubts as to whether you should take it “so easy” and take a stand right away without first finding out about the conflict. 

And so the truth - that you can't explain war by who started it - becomes a lie. Because it is not at all the start of rethinking Ukraine, but only the swan song to partisanship here, while it is being held on there."

And of course azerbaijanis being well uneducated and hatefull nation they will eat it up. Just go to any Armenian related video on youtube I am not kidding there are azeris threating to kill innocent Armenians. The level of fascism in that country is insane, it's as bad as Nazi Germany or Japan (pre ww2). All they want is to murder and destroy innocent Armenians who lived in this land for 1000s of years. And I am so tired of this shit already, every autumn since 2020 they attack and murder Armenians, they treat Armenians worse then Chinese gov treats Uygurs and Tibetans, as bad as Russia to Ukraine. but you probably don't know about it. why? because all the European govs had been bribed by the dictatorship. And they are currently very much cucked by both Russia and Azerbaijan, oh who are both Allies btw, forgot to mention an important point both Armenia and aze are post soviet countries, and Russia plays huge part in war, supplying both nations with weapons and benefiting from it. In 2018 when Armenia tried to kick out it's pro russian Gov like Ukraine did Russia decided to attack Armenia, but how if they don't have a border with Armenia well use Azerbaijan and it's brainwashed citizens. Armenia is a democtratic country surrounded with dictatorships like Azerbaijan, Turkey, Russia and of course all of them hate the fact that Armenia is a free country. so they all joined there forces and did everything to destroy Artsakh a disputed territory between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which is majority Armenian. And today Medvedev (Russian Prime minister) addmited that all of this was planed by Russia to keep Armenia under Russian control.

 I can go on and on this conflict is very complicated. my point is I HATE EVERY SINGLE WORLD LEADER in this world, all of them are corrupt psychopathic scumbags who are ready to murder 120 000 innocent people just for profit, they will frame this conflict as both sided even though it is obvious that one side hurts another one. If you are American or European I don't blame you for all of this just be happy that you are born in a country where you can achieve your dreams, that your biggest problems are solvable, I don't even know what will happen to my country, will it be destroyed by psychopathic murderous, rapist, fascist scumbags? or will it be saved. the last news I read was how azeri forces attacked a school bus with children and murdered all of them, there nation is celebrating the death of those children, if you are going to defend a nation that murders children, rapes women, destroys historic monument, beheads captive soldiers and makes zooparks of all the corpses, then you are just a psychopathic person or a brainwashed one.

The hardest part of being Armenian is the realization that the world is that the world is unfair and corrupt place. I don't know already what to say... fuck this world."

10/6/2023,If or when Aliyev invades Syunik will you support such move and what would be the aftermath?,"Hello,

I've been off Reddit for a long time now but **sadly** I'm back as I really want to hear your opinions (Reddit is terrible for your mental health ;)). I'm a foreigner living in Armenia and had no idea about your conflict till just few years ago.

I might be biased because I experienced life in Armenia and I love its ppl but again I expect the same here from your side but in good faith I hope we can try to be as subjective as possible. I understand there are accusations from both sides and I understand both Armenians and Azerbaijanis have their own version of ""history"" and frankly I don't care or want to engage in them. My main concern and question is ""what would you do when your government invade Armenia's Syunik region?"" I started my question by if but honestly at this point by looking at Aliyev's and Erdogan's comments over the years, the geopolitics and the fact that you guys are on a winning streak since 2020 I'd be very surprised if Azerbaijan doesn't invade Syunik within the next 3 years.

As I learned over the last few years ""territorial integrity and internationally recognized borders"" were/are important and unquestionable facts that the good people of Azerbaijan believe in and so I want to know what would you do if your government and army violates the sovereignty of Armenia. Now I don't believe it'll be an official invasion but along the line of the last two wars ""*we're retaliating over border provocations or it's anti-terror operation*"". I hope you won't mind me saying this but I think you have to be a true man of faith (or an idiot) to believe that a military operation on the scale, precision and execution of the 2020 war or the recent 2023 takeover of Karabakh was a spontaneous reaction and not the well-planned and well prepared for military operations that they were. Again I'm not interested in the morals behind these two wars themselves or who's right or wrong, these were clearly well planned operations with hard evidence of well preparedness whether these were the massive movements of troops under the guise of drills or the expedited shipments from Israel just days before.

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/09/15/azerbaijani-troops-russian-style-symbols-armenia-border/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/09/15/azerbaijani-troops-russian-style-symbols-armenia-border/)

The reason I'm mentioning the last two wars is because I've seen many here defends them as reaction to provocation which I think is an insult to any person with a moderate IQ. I don't believe that starting a war means that you're necessarily the evil one but lying about it is not helpful to say the least.

Once again I do believe (and many so including embassies in Armenia that warm=n from traveling to the southern belt) that Azerbaijan will announce ""border provocations"" with Armenia sooner or later near its borders with Syunik and/or Nakhijevan and a ""military operation"" will take place to connect the mainland AZ with its exclave and to Turkey. Such operation obviously will be disastrous to AM and likely to AZ as well. I'd imagine the deaths from both sides would make the 90s war seems like the good old days in comparison, reason being is Aliev will become ""Putin"" in a sense of ""I can't lose this bloody war"" and the Armenians will decide that ""this is it, we either continue to exist or it's the end for all of us"". Both sides are also now millions of miles better equipped than the post-soviet AM and AZ. With Turkey and Israel's support I think Syunik will fall but at a heavy cost for both and the international backlash will be severe (or maybe not). Still Aliev will become the ""Hero"" of the Turkic world in such move and cement his presidency for  a couple more decades, perhaps that alone would justify the cost. Now should Armenia prevail in defending Syunik and send Aliyev back with a bloody nose then the fallout of such defeat may threaten his family's rule of the country at best and at worst may cause ripple effect of fight over power should he fall (Sounds outlandish but the longer an autocrat rules the harder he falls like in cases of Libya post-Ghadaafi and Iraq post-Saddam).

Ooopps that was a long one, I'd like to hear your opinion about this and whether or not you support an invasion of Syunik and what do you think the outcome will be."

9/23/2023,The Hipocrasy of Switzerlands foreign policy,"Switzerland loves seeing itself as a peacemaking nation with a long humanitarian tradition. It's famous enough for diplomacy that the United Nations Office is located in Geneva and we pride ourselves in being a temporary member of the Security Council. Yet, when there is an ethnic cleansing happening where helping it doesn't benefit us politically or econimically, we look the other way. Obviously politics are selfish but the fact that the Swiss people don't even care is sickening. When Ukraine was attacked we all poured out our support but when over a hundred thousand people whose harvests we don't depend on, are being killed we don't care at all. **For those of you who don't know yet:**

  
In the country of Azerbaijan (south of Russia, west of Turkey, north of Iran) about 120'000 Armenians live. Armenia is a neighbour of Azerbaijan and the area in Azerbaijan, called Artsakh or ""Mount-Karabakh"", where 97% Armenians live has been claimed by both countries for the past three decades. Since Azerbaijan has received military and financial aid from Turkey, the only other country worlwide along with Azerbaijan denying the Armenian genocide of 1915, and Israel it has become far more powerful than Armenia. After the EU signed a deal for oil and gas with Azerbaijan and Russia began valuing Azerbaijan more than Armenia, the countries fought once again and Azerbaijan began a siege of Mount-Karabakh. This was after Armenia surrendered to Azerbaijan and accepted Mount-Karbakh as Azerbaijan territory. The Internatial Court of Justice demanded this siege to be lifted but since no country really cared and Armenia was poor, Azerbaijan kept it up for almost 10 months. Only five days ago, after people had already starved, was the corridor finally opened for some trucks of the International Red Cross. Just so the region could be bombed the day after. Both Turkish and Azerbaijan politicans are talking about invading Armenian mainland too.  
This conflict is complicated and I'm trying to keep myself short. For further information, please ask me in the comments.  
I am Swiss but I have visisted Armenia last week. Their situation is hopeless, their people defenseless. This isn't like Ukraine or Taiwan where a nation is threatened by a superpower. It doesn't take much to prevent these deaths because Azerbaijan isn't a global power. They only dare to do these things, if nobody's looking. I am dissapointed that our government isn't speaking out about it but I am even more disappointed that even though our media mentions the conflict, we Swiss people aren't speaking out about it.  


**TL;DR:** Over 100'000 People in Mount-Kararbakh are being killed and all Switzerland would have to do to stop it, is to speak out about it. But we stay silent.

##Armenia urges UN World Court to impose interim orders on Azerbaijan for ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh, demands withdrawal of Azerbaijani army from civilian settlements

**ARMENIA:** We have been warning for many months that Azerbaijan was preparing an ethnic cleansing. On September 19, Azerbaijan launched a massive attack on Nagorno-Karabakh. Then, for the first time in 9 months of blockade, Azerbaijan cynically opened the Lachin corridor for the Armenians to leave the region where they had lived for centuries.

There are no Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh now. And if this is not ethnic cleansing, then what is ethnic cleansing?

Azerbaijani representative will say that his country is ready for peace and so on. But he said the same thing 9 months ago. Then the blockade started. There was a brutal attack, because of which Armenians were forced out of the land of their ancestors.

Azerbaijan will declare that it is ready for the return of Armenians, but they said the same thing after the 2020 war. Not a single Armenian was allowed to return to the occupied territories after 2020.

Azerbaijan will promise to respect the rights and security of the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh. But They voiced similar promises before. However, this did not prevent it from violating international conventions.

Ethnic cleansing and attempts to erase the Armenian trace in the region, as it happened in Nakhijevan, can be stopped only if the interim measures of the UN World Court are applied. Nothing other than targeted and unequivocal provisional measures protecting the rights of ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh will suffice. //

##thousands of Nagorno-Karabakh refugees have left Armenia for other countries // programs are underway to assist refugees and keep them in Armenia

**PASHINYAN:** Records show that 2,500 residents of Nagorno-Karabakh have left Armenia for other countries, possibly to visit their relatives abroad. We hope this is temporary and they will return once they overcome the state of shock. *In the event* they cannot return to Nagorno-Karabakh, our policy is to create conditions for the forcibly displaced persons to remain in Armenia, to live, work and study here. Soon we will launch programs related to demographics, housing, etc.

We are in touch with international donors who have agreed to help the forcibly displaced persons. All donations must be received and processed fully transparently. 

I must also note the feedback we have received from our international partners regarding the organizational work to host the refugees. They are surprised that we were able to receive an influx of 100,000 refugees within a span of just 3 days. They described it as ""unprecedented"", and were surprised by our ability to house and assist people so quickly. Keep in mind that we did not have any plan because the depopulation of Nagorno-Karabakh was never on our table. Everything was organized within hours and days. I'd like to thank every mayor, the workers at the Humanitarian Center, Cabinet members, NGOs, and volunteers for their dedicated work, a work that's still in progress. We ask volunteers to continue to help assess the needs of refugees by making in-home visits. The state employees could not have handled this alone. //

The Government discussed various programs to support the refugees, employment for teachers, etc. A teacher from Nagorno-Karabakh who becomes a teacher in Armenia will receive a 30% bonus. 

The Government is currently transferring hundreds of dollars in emergency cash assistance, lump sum and monthly, to bank accounts created for each refugee.

4,600 refugee students will receive financial assistance to attend universities or colleges in Armenia. 13,000 lower-grade students have already enrolled in Armenia.

Refugees who worked in the medical field may not qualify for work in Armenia because Nagorno-Karabakh did not have the same standards *(minimum experience hours, study credits)* recently implemented in Armenia, so the government has decided to waive that requirement until 2025.

On Thursday the Government approved a $68 million package to provide various types of assistance over the next 6 months. Around $100 million has been allocated as of right now.

##Russian FM Lavrov about Armenia-Russia relations   

**REPORTER:** There is a crisis in AM-RU relations and a growing anti-Russian sentiment in Armenia. Are we approaching a point of no return?

**LAVROV:** The flaming of anti-Russian sentiment is being done artificially. Many NGOs have been created in Armenia over the past years. There were in addition to many that already existed. These NGOs are being created to harm the AM-RU relations and to promote Western interests in the South Caucasus through Armenia.

These attempts are somewhat successful but we are deeply convinced that the vast majority of Armenian people are interested in the development of centuries-old brotherly relations with the Russian Federation. *[""Russian Federation"" did not exist ""centuries"" ago, dipshit. But I digress.]*.

I'd like to bring to your attention that PM Pashinyan [gave an interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/174xilz/pashinyan_discloses_secrets_during_interview/
) a few days ago in which he clearly stated that Armenia is not changing its foreign vector. We hope this position will prevail despite the attempts to drag Armenia into another direction. //

##PACE urges Azerbaijan and few other members to investigate spyware abuse

The countries: Poland, Hungary, Greece, Spain and Azerbaijan.

Citing “mounting evidence” that Israeli-made Pegasus spyware has been used for illegitimate purposes by several members, the PACE has urged five governments to provide information on their use of such spyware within three months, and fully investigate all cases of abuse.

PACE also asked Israel, a PACE observer state, on how it ensures that Pegasus is not exported to countries where it could be used to violate human rights.

##PACE adopts a resolution against Azerbaijan's military aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh and the ethnic cleansing 

**Armenia's delegation:** PACE notes that there are reasonable suspicions of ethnic cleansing and that almost the entire population has left their homeland due to the threat of physical destruction and the long-standing anti-Armenian policy of the Azerbaijani government.

PACE urges the Committee of Ministers to launch relevant procedures in response to the serious breach of statutory obligations by Azerbaijan. 
In the event Azerbaijan refuses to respect its obligations, PACE could challenge Azerbaijani's mandate; Azerbaijan's membership in PACE could be suspended. //

**PASHINYAN:** This is a very important development for Armenia. It is the highest since 2018. The state assistance programs aimed at improving demographics have undoubtedly played a role here, including the reforms in the healthcare sector. 

It's also worth mentioning that we have the lowest death rate in that period. 

We have a significant reduction in stillbirths. The overall quality of medical service has improved, including thanks to higher wages and larger state subsidies to medical centers for pet-patver. There is also a new leasing program that allows medical centers to acquire modern equipment. 

We must focus on reducing deaths caused by traffic incidents. It actually declined last year but unfortunately, we witnessed several large incidents this year. Even without them, the situation would have been unacceptable. //

**INTERIOR MINISTER:** Statistics show that traffic deaths are disproportionately higher in regions with staffing [police] shortages, for example in Syunik. We expect to see a significant drop after the introduction of the new Patrol Service in the 4 remaining provinces. //

**PASHINYAN:** When we created the Patrol Service, at the time the goal was for the rollout to be ""smooth"". We didn't want them to jump right in and write lots of tickets, we wanted the emphasis to be on warning and prevention. But this issue with traffic deaths makes it clear that there should be no leniency towards violating drivers. We have Soviet-era cargo trucks that lack reflective materials for nighttime driving. We still have to work with communities to properly paint the lane dividers and install safety signs. We have a massive problem here that needs to be addressed. //

##opposition accuses Defense Ministry of shady arms deal / Latter denies & provides details 
 
The opposition activists shared a document on the internet and claimed Minister of Defense Tonoyan supplied weapons to Turkey and the Syrian terrorists, among other shady contracts.
 
**MoD responded:** yesterday, certain media outlets circulated a coordinated lie to discredit the Ministry.
 
1) The document claims the MoD used a middleman to sell weapons to Turkey which was then used by terrorists hired from Syria. This is a complete lie. The document is being presented in a way to manipulate and build a narrative.
 
2) It claims MoD gave $3.5m to a middleman with friendly ties with Minister Davit Tonoyan. This is a lie. The money was given to a foreign arms company, through the middleman, with the purpose of ensuring that Armenia continues to receive weapons. 

Moreover, the foreign arms supplier had already supplied some of the weapons, the value of which was above what we had paid. The $3.5m mentioned in the document is a fraction of the total arms deal.
 
It's strange that this document was leaked now. We gave it to another government agency for examination in 2018. *[they are possibly hinting that former NSS chief Arthur Vanetsyan obtained this document in 2018 and circulated it today as retaliation for his arrest]*
 
3) The rumor claims that certain individuals offered MoD to buy bulletproof vests from Russia for $300 but the MoD rejected it and used another seller to buy it for $1,000 apiece.
 
This is an obvious and impudent lie. The MoD purchases weapons from Russia at the below-market value, per AM-RU agreement. We did not buy the same Russian vests at a higher price.
 
In this particular case, the vests that we purchased, which came with helmets, were in very limited quantities, were purchased from the official Russian government seller, exclusively for special forces troops for complex combat activities. These vests are of higher quality and cost significantly more than what regular troops wear.
 
The MoD condemns the coordinated campaign to manipulate the public with actions that are harmful to national security and demands retraction by media outlets. We expect law enforcement to deal with document leakers.

&nbsp;
 
The Defense Ministry also accused the opposition of twisting MoD Tonoyan's words about drones.
 
**MoD:** after the 2016 April battles, [now-minister] Tonoyan gave an interview during which he spoke about the effectiveness of Israeli-made Harop drones. Yesterday a video was circulated showing strikes made by much more advanced Bayraktar drones. Tonoyan's words were twisted to claim he downplayed Bayraktar's effectiveness.
 
In reality, Tonoyan was talking about Harop drones which are easier to detect or evade due to loud engine noise, etc. Bayraktars fly at a higher altitude and are harder to detect.
 
Moreover, the Israeli Harop drones, just as in 2016 battles, were easily detected and downed during the 2020 war. The army shot ~200 such drones during this war.

##arrests & trials over ""coup & assassination plot""
 
Several arrests were made yesterday over an alleged coup and assassination attempt against PM Pashinyan. A phone call that was made between the suspects was leaked yesterday.
 
A suspect and militaryman Ashot Minasyan, who is accused of smuggling weapons from Artsakh, will remain in jail for 2 months pre-trial, after the court found his arrest justified. He was a participant in the leaked call. He denies wrongdoing.
 
Another suspect is ex-NSS chief Arthur Vanetsyan. He was also arrested and charged yesterday. The court found his pre-trial arrest unjustified and released him. He was not a participant of the leaked call, but his name was mentioned by other participants. He denies wrongdoing.
 
Another suspect ex-HHK MP Vahram Baghdasaryan was also charged. Prosecutors asked the court for pre-trial arrest. He is a party in the phone call.

##the political turmoil continues / opposition vs government
 
A Russian-Armenian public figure allied with Armenian opposition claimed that First Lady Anna Hakobyan unnecessarily interfered with the military's work in Artsakh, which resulted in disputes and the ""firing"" of a general.
 
Artsakh president's spokesman Poghosyan wrote then removed a post in which he denied the ""myths"" about Anna Hakobyan participating in Artsakh's Military Council meetings. The general [Movses Hakobyan] who was allegedly ""fired"" after the ""confrontation"" with Anna Hakobyan, had actually traveled to Armenia for COVID treatment, reads Artsakh president spokesman's post.
 
https://factor.am/309887.html
 
Aram A Catholicos has urged unity among Armenians. He urged rejection of the signed document. Praised the army that fought against ""enemies with state-of-the-art weapons"".
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034926.html
 
Pro-Kocharyan opposition activist Artur Danielyan (Adekvad gang/party) was released from jail. His office was searched and computers were confiscated. He believes it's over a Livestream he made earlier.
 
https://news.am/arm/news/613562.html
 
Opposition figures said they have information about a threat against their lives by ""armed groups allied with the government"". The police asked for more information to launch an investigation.
 
https://news.am/arm/news/613561.html
 
Opposition ARF and several of its international branches have called for the government's resignation.
 
https://news.am/arm/news/613492.html , https://news.am/arm/news/613493.html
 
The names of 51 more deceased soldiers were published, bringing the total identified to 1434. The army has the bodies of 2317 soldiers, some of whom are yet to be identified. Simultaneously, the process of exchanging bodies with Azerbaijan continues and the number is likely to rise.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034912.html , https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034918.html
 
 
Armenian withdrawal from the north-western Qarvachar region has been postponed from November 15th to November 25th. The withdrawal process has slowed down in other regions as well due to weather and de-mining activities.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034923.html , https://news.am/arm/news/613518.html
 
Healthcare Minister Torosyan met and thanked the Armenian and foreign doctors who have been helping the wounded soldiers throughout the war.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034937.html
 
The Supreme Court president has urged all the judges to remain neutral, free from government or opposition influence, and to do their duties.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034942.html
 
The opposition held a rally earlier and brought a group of soldiers, presenting them as their allies, and as being ""real fighters unlike Pashinyan's puppets who wear uniforms and make videos claiming to support Pashinyan"".
 
One of the soldiers, brought by the opposition, later came forward, saying he was duped by BHK Naira Zohrabyan. ""Our unit was told we were being taken to outposts but they brought us to [opposition rally] and presented us as frontline defenders. I didn't know what was happening. We aren't frontline soldiers. I apologize to my fellow soldiers in front lines.""
 
https://youtu.be/3ku3pVkk8g4?t=26
 
 
##Flashback October 8th / commander tells soldiers to ""leave positions, this war is a conspiracy pre-planned by the govt""
 
**Pashinyan wrote on October 8th**: A few days ago I was alerted that someone in the front lines goes around and tells soldiers that ""go, leave your positions, Pashinyan has already sold the lands, this was a conspired war. There is no point in guarding the positions. You're here to be used as cannon fodder to cover up the pre-planned conspiracy.
 
According to sources, the soldiers were even ordered to leave their positions. I ordered the NSS to investigate. One of the suspects, a Stepanakert resident, was arrested in Yerevan. Not all details are clear. There is a possibility it's a political campaign.
 
I urge all Armenians who have similar info to come forward. The traitors have no place in the ranks of our heroic generals and volunteers.
 
**NSS released details that evening:** the suspect N.M., being the deputy-commander of the communication platoon in [classified] unit, while being in front lines during his duties, decided to collude with the captain to go around and spread false information among the soldiers.
 
They told soldiers that the government - in reality- had pre-planned to give away these lands, so it doesn't make sense to continue to fight. This caused significant damage to their morale and some of them left the positions.
 
**Media writes the same day:** the arrested suspect is [Robert Kocharyan's friend] Vitaly Balasanyan's friend. He had earlier met Kocharyan, Serj Sargsyan, and Arthur Vanetsyan while in Artsakh. We don't know the content of their discussions.

##Artsakh Defense Army chief Arzumanyan speech:
 
Dear compatriots, from Sep-27 to Nov-9 we had to resist the joint aggression by Azerbaijan, Turkey, and their hired terrorists. After 44 days of heavy battles, the Armenian fighters showed acts of heroism, but unfortunately, that wasn't enough to win. The outcome has objective and subjective reasons, which will be analyzed and honest investigation will be carried out.
 
But today we have what we have. Our starting point should be not the dreams we have but the established reality, so we can achieve our dream later. For that, we need unity and a sense of personal responsibility. We need to put an end to the rumors and lies.
 
The truth is, Artsakh exists and will continue to exist. Our army exited the war with heavy wounds but will continue to do its duties more united and disciplined than ever. The army maintained its structure, and the future changes will be done not to dismantle it but to reform it to achieve unprecedented combat effectiveness.
 
Unfounded rumors are unfair to the soldiers who are, first and foremost, still serving to protect the front lines. Their duty is to protect our borders and people's right to live there. Many have sacrificed their lives to achieve this. I am confident we will be worthy of their sacrifice.

##University Network for Human Rights sends its analysis to UN's Genocide Prevention office about the ""risk of ethnic cleansings and possible genocide"" in Nagorno-Karabakh

>The ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, known as Artsakh by Armenians, is under the very real threat of ethnic cleansing and potential genocide. The risk may extend to the southern portion of Armenia as well

...

>Indicator 10.3. Widespread or systematic discriminatory or targeted practices or violence against the lives, freedom or physical and moral integrity of a protected group, even if not yet reaching the
level of elimination.

>Azerbaijan has deployed a series of mutually reinforcing measures that have made life in Nagorno-Karabakh impossible for its 120,000 inhabitants. This situation will result in the mass exodus of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh (assuming Azerbaijan lifts the blockade of the Lachin Corridor and ceases to threaten those who leave with arbitrary detention), the coerced surrender of the self-declared independent republic to subjugation under Azerbaijan, or the slaughter of the Armenians still living in Nagorno-Karabakh

...

>investigations also strongly suggest that Azerbaijani officials have condoned, facilitated, and directly perpetrated enforced disappearances tied to arbitrary detentions and the use of secret detention

...

>Resort to methods or practices of violence that dehumanize a protected group, that reveal an intention to cause humiliation, fear or terror to fragment the group, or that reveal an intention to change its identity: Azerbaijani forces filmed and/or photographed the bodies of civilians and combatants who had been extrajudicially killed or killed in action, including bodies that had been mutilated. Practices include
chopping off limbs, carving messages across torsos, exposing victims’ genitals and breasts

>Families of prisoners of war have described receiving video messages of their loved ones being forced to dance naked while in captivity.

>Azerbaijan opened a Military Trophy Park after its victory in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War featuring grotesque and degrading statues of defeated Armenians.

>Azerbaijan began producing a commemorative stamp showing a split-screen image of an Azerbaijani soldier and a man in a chemical biohazard suit standing over a map of Azerbaijan and fumigating the area of Nagorno-Karabakh.

...

>our concern that a trigger could escalate the crisis at any moment has compelled us to present this submission to you sooner rather than later. It is our hope that your expertise can enrich and inform our risk analysis, identify opportunities to mitigate key risk factors, and help alert the international community to the gravity of the threat facing Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians.

##EU releases a statement on the blockade of the Lachin corridor after a meeting of the EU Committee of Ministers:

(1) The continued movement restrictions and the humanitarian and security consequences affecting the Karabakh Armenians concern us.

(2) Partial blockade since December. No movement of food or medicine starting June. People don't have essential goods.

(3) We call for the full resumption of Red Cross activities. Its activities have been heavily hampered.

(4) Respect the Nov. 9 Trilateral Statement, the ECHR interim measures, and the World Court order. Ensure the free and secure movement along the Lachin corridor.

(5) We have taken note of Azerbaijan's readiness to supply goods via Agdam. We strongly believe the Lachin corridor must be unblocked, in line with past agreements and the World Court Order.

(6,7) We're watching the AM-AZ border. 

(8,10) Hold negotiations between AM-AZ and NK-AZ as soon as possible.

(9) We have a guy who's ready to help resolve the humanitarian issues. 

(11) AM and AZ have reaffirmed their full respect for each other's territorial integrity. Now delimit the borders. 

(12) Don't spew hatred. Commit to dialogue in good faith. Resolve humanitarian issues to trust.

(13) EU is really good, admit it.

##Armenia does not owe an explanation to Russia 

Russia had earlier warned Armenia against ratifying the Rome Statute. The Armenian government delayed the ratification but eventually decided to proceed with it. 

**KHANDANYAN, ruling party MP:** It is Armenia's sovereign decision to ratify the Rome Statute. Armenia does not owe an explanation to any party on why it joins this international mechanism. The Rome Statute is an important document. Armenia's recognition of ICC will serve as an additional security mechanism.

**REPORTER:** Is there a chance it might not pass in parliament?

**KHANDANYAN**: It needs to be discussed and voted on in parliament. It hasn't even gone through the preliminary committee process yet.

Anna Hakobyan and first ladies of other states are taking part in a humanitarian initiative to protect children. During the panel discussion, she also raised awareness of the struggles of 30,000 children of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

There are multiple reports that Armenia will also deliver humanitarian aid to Ukraine this month. The news was picked up by multiple popular Russian opposition outlets which accused Putin of bringing NATO closer to Russia (Scandinavia) and losing the remaining allies. 

They noted that Armenia refused to host CSTO military training earlier this year but will hold one with the U.S. next week.

##Armenia will acquire a 5-storey building in downtown London to upgrade its tiny embassy 

The Armenian embassy in the UK, which occupies an area size of a 2br apartment, is being evicted by the landlord. *It's complicated.* 

The government has decided to upgrade its presence by acquiring a 5-storey building worth $22 million. They want you to know that they were able to bazaar their way into an $800,000 discount.

The old area has always significantly limited the possibilities of the embassy, said the government. The new embassy will be located near the embassies of other countries, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, UK's foreign ministry building, etc.

##Maybe Kremlin enjoys being humiliated? || How Serj swindled EU || Armenia's relations with Russia & CSTO

Interview with analyst Hovsep Khurshudyan.

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan complained about Russia's inaction. Russia's foreign ministry responded sharply. 

**KHURSHUDYAN:** You know what's strange? Azerbaijan has been constantly humiliating Russia with impunity. It sent aid to Ukraine, its former ambassador called ethnic Russians ""pigs"", its new ambassador to Ukraine praised the Ukrainian army and how they are destroying Russian forces, etc. Have you heard a single complaint from Russia? It's as if they are enjoying the humiliation. 

But when Armenia takes minor steps to strengthen its sovereignty and simply brings up the fact that Russia isn't following the agreements, and when Armenia finally decides to send humanitarian aid to Ukraine, suddenly that's a major scandal for the Kremlin.

Earlier this week a guy from a private organization [unrelated to NATO] urged Armenia to join NATO. Russia's state media picked up on that and spread false claims about Armenia receiving an invitation to join NATO. The entire Russian state press has turned yellow. *""Don't you dare to join NATO.""*

This is pathological. Armenia is a tiny slave for them. A slave who must forever whine under their feet and not have any sovereignty. This is necessary so they can continue to sell parts of Armenia while simultaneously gaslighting Armenians to come and beg them for help.  

I'm happy that we've finally decided to send aid to Ukraine, to acknowledge that Russia isn't our ally anymore, and to ratify the Rome Statute. The latter isn't a step against Russia. Its purpose is to turn the war criminal Ilham Aliyev into a Milosevich.

Things Russia can't/won't do: Supply weapons, follow the AM-RU defense agreements, and be an ally.

Things Russia can do: Raise the energy prices, suppress AM-RU trade, and activate its 5th column within Armenia. 

What will happen if Armenia leaves the Russian sphere for good?

(1) The 5th column knows they'll be dealing with authorities if they try anything illegal. 

(2) The gas price could increase but at least we would have wider access to Western military tech. Armenia would become more interesting for foreign investors.

(3) Trade. Only ~30% of our actual trade is with Russia. We have the ability to increase trade with Europe. Armenia is ahead of the Association states Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine with its parameters and is actually closer to the EU than them. This is the second time Germany is urging Armenia to apply for the EU. We could replace Russia with the EU and Iran.

And it's a big ""if"" whether Russia would actually shut down trade with Armenia. They need Armenia's trade more than ever. Certain types of products are being imported to Russia via Armenia today. Armenia must use this as leverage to strengthen its sovereignty. 

**REPORTER:** Why did Pashinyan snap at Kremlin *now*?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Not now, but in September 2022, when Russia officially betrayed Armenia by ignoring its defense obligations. The topic of leaving CSTO and inviting EU monitors was placed on the agenda in 2022. Russia didn't like the presence of the EU.

Did I miss CSTO's condemnation of Azerbaijan's border attack last week? Did they even make a statement? This time Armenia didn't even bother to apply to CSTO. That's good. It's a pointless butaforie structure. But CSTO should have responded with a statement even without Armenia's application. 

Russia and Armenia must gradually learn to live apart. Russia must realize that Armenia is a sovereign state and not a puppet.  

**REPORTER:** How will the ratification of the Rome Statute affect Armenia's relations with Putin?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Forget about Putin. We need to ratify it for our own people. Putin's MOD Sergey Shoygu accidentally let it slip that the 2020 war was a ""brilliant operation with our Turkish partners"".  

Our previous leaders allowed this to happen by launching the Tatarstanization of Armenia. What was the Serj administration's response when Russia began selling $4 billion worth of weapons to Azerbaijan? What was the Kocharyan administration's response to Russia's $300 million sale of S-300 to Azerbaijan? 

Russia spat on our faces, while our leaders claimed ""It's raining"". That was our foreign policy then. Their argument was that it's actually good that Russia is selling weapons to Azerbaijan because it's better Russia than someone else, ""it's just business"". They were justifying Russia's decision to arm our enemy. A new level of self-deception was fed to the public. 

The next step was taking us to the EAEU, and signing protocols in CSTO in 2010 to prevent the deployment of third-party troops in Armenia. Armenia did not demand anything in exchange for that paragraph. Our government ignored our plea to demand the addition of the second paragraph to prohibit Russia from selling weapons to CSTO member Armenia's enemy Azerbaijan. They didn't even have the courage to demand that. 

**REPORTER:** Serj rejected the EU document and took us to Russia's EAEU bloc instead. His reasoning was that it would guarantee the security of Nagorno-Karabakh. Did it work?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** It was an attempt to fool the public. Armenia already had all sorts of defense agreements with Russia. If Russia was an ally, that should have been enough. Did our EAEU membership prevent the sale of Russian weapons to Azerbaijan? Of course not. The only thing we got was Europe recognizing Armenia as an ""occupant"". 

Europe fell for Serj's scheme and was betrayed at the last moment when he decided to join the Russian bloc instead. Prior to that, Europe was intentionally ignoring Serj's anti-democratic conduct and falsifications. They allowed Serj's dictatorship to flourish as long as they thought Serj was going to be their ally. It was dishonorable. Serj swindled them. 

This was followed by the European Parliament adopting a resolution recognizing Armenia as an occupant. So were you surprised by EU's indifference during the 2020 war? 

Thank goodness the government is attempting to correct those mistakes today by moving us away from the Russian bloc. The Russian military base on the AM-TR border should be shut down as well. We do have the ability to guard the border with Turkey. In case you didn't know, half of the Russian base soldiers are local ethnic Armenians. Possibly the majority of the AM-TR border is guarded by Armenians today.

##update: French embassy denies rumors about Macron's visit to Armenia 

Rumors were circulated by Armenian and Azerbaijani outlets claiming that Macron might visit Yerevan and Baku this weekend. He will not.

Armenian analysts (on Chibukhchyan Live) suspected that it might be an information operation by Azeri agents to spread disinformation, hype something up, and then leave Armenians disappointed. The suspicions are possibly true, except the source of the disinformation was allegedly Kremlin-backed media figures and not Azeris. 

**Ukrainian researcher:** The source of this information was the ""Aphla News"" outlet operated by Kremlin propagandists with the aim of targeting the Armenian diaspora living in the West. //

It should be noted that there is no conclusive evidence of this yet.

##Azerbaijan threatens Armenia: if you do not give me a Zangezur corridor right now, I'll take my business elsewhere and get a road via Iran instead

Context: Armenia and Azerbaijan signed an agreement on Nov. 9, 2020, to open regional communications passing through Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia would gain railway and road access to Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, while Azerbaijan would gain railway and road access to Nekhijevan and Turkey via Armenia. 

Armenia agreed to implement the project and proposed a plan to install customs to regulate the trade. Azerbaijan intentionally misinterpreted the agreement and demanded the road to be essentially a sovereign corridor instead. This was against the agreement so Armenia refused despite pressure and Azerbaijan's military attacks.

**Azerbaijani government today:** That corridor is one of the elements of the East-West transport route and could increase traffic by 5-8 million tons. It would benefit Armenia, Azerbaijan, and others. 

We have Plan B. We can build this corridor without Armenia's participation. It will be Armenia's loss. //

Azerbaijan and Iran have been discussing the construction of a new route that bypasses Armenia. It will be 5 km south of Armenia. The agreement to build the road was signed last year.

##anti-corruption: former deputy mayor of Yerevan is charged with corruption and causing $7.7 million in damages to the city in a case involving the infamous garbage collector ""Sanitek""

They let the shit pile up so much it finally hit the fan.

**Anti-Corruption Committee:** Ex-deputy mayor Vahe Nikoyan and other municipality employees acted as a group to carry out the scheme. A company had applied to become the trash collector in some districts. They didn't do their duties yet the defendants ignored it and made payments, and then extra payments, to the company. There were also violations during the tender process to choose the company. The garbage company gave a bribe to the deputy mayor's family through a property rental scheme. The events took place in 2015-2016. //

The accused are innocent until proven guilty in the court of law.

##the question of Shushi repopulation during past negotiations
 
**CivilNet's Tatul:** yesterday Putin spoke about an offer made on October 19-20 that would have stopped the war. Aliyev and Putin had agreed to stop the war if Azerbaijan settled its population in Shushi. Pashinyan was against it.
 
Army chief Onik Gasparyan said yesterday, ""On the 4th day I presented our losses and suggested to end the war within 3 days, otherwise, if the intensity of battles remained the same, we would expire our resources quickly and have more unfavorable negotiating leverage.""
 
The question is, why did Pashinyan reject Putin's offer [Azeris in Shushi] if the army gave that analysis?
 
First possibility. Most likely, Pashinyan hoped that it would be possible to defend Shushi militarily, considering its fortress nature and conviction among Armenians that it's hard to capture. Pashinyan was convinced that not only the army could defend Shushi, but also turn the tide on the Shushi outskirts [gyorbagyor gorge].
 
Second possibility. Pashinyan preferred to fight, even at the cost of casualties, rather than agree to let Azeris return to Shushi.
 
There may be other reasons. Only Pashinyan can clarify this. The topic of Azeris returning to Shushi has been an important part of past negotiations. Baku has wanted Shushi resettlement since May-1994.
 
On Dec-1997 the OSCE proposed a phased resolution which was mostly accepted by Armenia's first president Levon Ter-Petrosyan. The document said the following about Shushi: ""the negotiations should clarify the status of Karabakh, and the questions around Lachin, Shushi, and Shahumyan"". Although it doesn't directly mention the return of Azeris to Shushi, it's obvious that the ""question around Shushi"" referred to the Azeri population's return to Shushi.
 
There was also a suggestion for both sides to remove their troops from Shushi and Shahumyan. Civilians would enjoy all civil rights and connection to Azerbaijan and Karabakh.
 
On Nov-1998 a document was proposed specifically about Shushi and Shahumyan: all Azeri refugees would return to Shushi, and the Karabakh govt would ensure their full rights. The same about Armenians returning to Shahumyan.
 
In 2001 in Key West, Armenia agreed for Azeris to return to Shushi. They even discussed a new road connecting southern Fizuli to Shushi.
 
Later, in the Madrid and Kazan documents, the topic of Shushi and Shahumyan wasn't mentioned because these two documents weren't comprehensive resolution packages, but rather ""principles"" for resolution. Shushi and Shahumyan were supposed to be discussed during negotiations, based on those principles.
 
If Armenia was smart since 1997, we would have peace for decades and wouldn't lose Shushi and Hadrut today.

##former MoD official Movses Hakobyan makes accusations / Ministry of Defense response 
 
A fired/resigned general Movses Hakobyan accused PM Pashinyan of not contacting Vladimir Putin and not asking Russia for help before September 30th (war began on 27th).
 
PM's office denied the claim and published media transcripts about conversations held between Pashinyan and Putin on September 27th and 29th.
 
Hakobyan also accused the army and administration of making wrong decisions, unprofessionalism, and being unprepared.
 
""The rest of the accusations made by Hakobyan against Pashinyan during Hakobyan's press conference were just as inaccurate. We view it under the context of a deliberate false report against the PM. The latter will address it when necessary,"" said PM's office
 
&nbsp;
 
Hakobyan made several other claims:  
 
He didn't like that Pashinyan fired him as the head of General Staff. He considers the new head Artsak Davtyan to be incompetent; Hakobyan had offered another replacement instead of Davtyan. He views the day when Davtyan was appointed as the ""beginning of the crumbling of the army"".
 
He claims there was little or no retreat in locations where the regular army defended the borders.
 
Claims there were big problems during war preparations.
 
Claims the government stopped the army replenishment on the 3rd day and instructed volunteers to go to front lines without proper equipment. ""This led to 1,500 troops routing by the 5th day of the war.""
 
Claims Iskander weapon was used but won't say when.
 
Claims Polye-21 weapon was imported which jammed Bayraktars for 4 days but Turkey found a workaround by tweaking control.
 
Claims Artsakh president Arayik Harutyunyan is correct about NSS forces refusing to help to protect north-eastern borders, but agrees with the soldiers' decision not to help, saying they weren't prepared for trench warfare.

 
&nbsp;
 
Hakobyan refused to take questions from the Azatutyun media outlet, calling them bad for Armenia.
 
Hakobyan's nephew is Armen Grigoryan, who is Pashinyan's Security Council secretary. ""In the past, when I was a public official, Armen was leading a campaign of an opposition [anti-Serj, presumably] politician. I couldn't change his mind at the time. He is an adult, I don't want to interfere with his decisions,"" said Hakobyan.

&nbsp;
 
The Ministry of Defense released a statement accusing Hakobyan of making statements some of which are false, while others containing top-secret information including about Armenia's international arms contracts, ""revelation of which puts national security at risk"".
 

**MoD statement:** // Hakobyan, who served as MoD's head of Logistics Department for a brief period, who had placed his signature under international weapon contracts that were formed as a result of agreements between governments of Armenia and other states, is now attempting to create the impression that the weapons which were effective during this war were purchased only while he was in charge.
 
That is false. Even if his signature is under some documents, that doesn't mean the negotiations to obtain those weapons started under his command. Moreover, some of the weapons mentioned by Hakobyan are being purchased regularly and aren't one-time contracts.
 
Hakobyan is making extremely dangerous statements by revealing the armed forces' structure and peculiarities of military units. This is top secret information, the revelation of which is a felony per Code 23.
 
Hakobyan criticized the decision to purchase Su-30 jets, calling it an ineffective decision. When making such claims, one should always keep in mind that the Defense Ministry of Armenia makes purchases not only for Artsakh security but also the security of the Republic of Armenia, against possible enemies who possess many modern fighter jets. Hakobyan had the opportunity to ask MoD whether the jets were used during this war, but he didn't. 
 
Hakobyan lied about Su-30sm jets not being equipped with missiles. The process was carried out before the war and concluded during the war. *[the jets were purchased very recently and the army earlier said they needed some time to train pilots and bring them to fighting state]*
 
Hakobyan claims that OSA air defense units purchased by Armenia weren't used and they were ineffective, and that had we purchased TOR units instead, we could resist the Turkish drones better. 

This claim is also further from the truth. First, we had TOR and OSA units but they were both destroyed by enemy drones, regardless of how modern they were. The problem is, the Bayraktar drones used against us were manufactured in recent months so the tools against these drones were still in the process of making.
 
Hakobyan incorrectly claims OSA air defense units weren't used. In reality, OSAs shot 62 enemy drones [Israeli-made ones, presumably]. Hakobyan should have remembered that it was this OSA weapon that shot Israeli-made Hermes-900 in July. Hakobyan focuses exclusively on OSAs yet we have other air defense tools, too, that are being continuously resupplied.
 
Hakobyan lied about the army mobilization process stopping on the 3rd day of the war. This is a complete lie and doesn't bring honor to a military man. Thousands of citizens can confirm that they were drafted later, appeared in local military offices, underwent training, and went to the front lines.
 
Moreover, in parallel with the proper replenishment of the troops, completely new military units were formed consisted of reservists. This was also recorded and presented by the media.
 
It's unacceptable for Hakobyan to claim that ""100% of what MoD said during the war were false"". Being a high ranking military official during the war, he never complained during the war. The MoD gave information in a way not to harm the ongoing military actions.
 
Hakobyan tries to deny catching COVID during the war, yet there are documents proving that he did. *[it was reported that Hakobyan had an issue with the first lady so he left Artsakh. Artsakh official later claimed he left Artsakh due to COVID.]*
 
Lastly, during his press conference, Hakobyan made statements about our international military cooperation agreements that are completely unacceptable and false, and there are documents that prove his claims are false. Hakobyan's motives to deny obvious facts are unclear.
 
The fact that Hakobyan no longer works in the system doesn't mean he should create new problems for the MoD that's already busy working 24/7.
 
MoD acknowledges that there were issues during the war, and is analyzing them in detail. Former GCS Movses Hakobyan bears some of the responsibility for these issues. //
 
&nbsp;
 
The SIS is investigating the claims made by Hakobyan. He was questioned for 40 minutes.
 
LHK party suggests the creation of a fact-finding Parliamentary group, led by the ruling party, to examine how the war was handled.

##November 19 timeline
 
**COVID stats:** +3,796 tested. +1,520 infected. +8,319 healed. +31 deaths. 31,243 active. 475,956 tested.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1035327.html
 
**9:00 Healthcare Minister Torosyan about COVID and soldiers:** the healthcare system remains overloaded due to COVID. However, we've been able to provide sufficient care to almost everyone. The death rate has been 1.5%; it's significantly lower than in some countries with 4-10%.
 
Many international doctors visited Armenia for COVID and soldier treatment. Some are still here. We agreed with the WHO to send a new COVID team. 

There are talks about the 3rd virus wave. Our doctors have been struggling for 8 months.

Some residents believe rumors and rush to purchase unnecessary antibiotics and ""COVID medicine"". This could lead to a shortage for those who actually need it. Fortunately, we have no issues with importing or locally producing more supplies.
 
36 medical centers have been able to provide aid to 100% of the wounded soldiers. Ambulance vehicles and helicopters worked around the clock during the war to transport the wounded to Armenia. 15% are in serious/critical condition. Around 1% of wounded soldiers died in hospitals. All hospitals are controlled by the govt under the military emergency law.
 
We're entering the rehabilitation phase. A new center with 250 beds will be built. Other centers will maximize their utilization. It'll be funded by the govt and diasporan aid. The govt will dedicate $5.2m every year for continuous care.  
 
We're currently building a new prosthesis center for soldiers who lost limbs. We'll build prosthesis in Armenia and make it available quickly.
 
We received large quantities of medical aid during the war, thank you. Nowadays the best help would be for diasporan experts to visit Armenia and help with their experience.
 
The increase in the Healthcare budget for 2021 will be small due to COVID economics, but it's still larger than a few years ago.

**12:19:** All Armenia Fund will hold the annual charity telethon in the US on November 26th. A phone-thon will be held in Europe on Nov 19-22.
 
Himnadram director Haykak Arshamyan dismissed rumors by former regime allied about wasting charity funds on salary bonuses. ""It's simple manipulation. The Fund money isn't used on salaries or bonuses. There is a contract that clearly defines how the money should be spent. Finance Ministry will soon publish the report and we'll place it on our website.""
 
""We cannot purchase weapons. Our funds are spent on healthcare, social welfare, so the govt can save money on those programs and [use its resources to buy weapons instead].""
 
Himnadram is cooperating with Artsakh and its regional branches to identify the top priorities. The first package is for Artsakh residents who need humanitarian aid, and the restoration of Artsakh infrastructure. The second package is for soldiers who need medical aid, therapy, mental health support.
 
The number of individual donors has significantly increased. 260,000 in the US alone, a similar number in Armenia. $60m out of $170m was collected in Armenia. When Himnadram encouraged monthly recurring donations, some 2000 people signed up within a week.

Global freedom faces a dire threat. Around the world, the enemies of liberal democracy—a form of self-government in which human rights are recognized and every individual is entitled to equal treatment under law—are accelerating their attacks. Authoritarian regimes have become more effective at co-opting or circumventing the norms and institutions meant to support basic liberties, and at providing aid to others who wish to do the same. In countries with long-established democracies, internal forces have exploited the shortcomings in their systems, distorting national politics to promote hatred, violence, and unbridled power. Those countries that have struggled in the space between democracy and authoritarianism, meanwhile, are increasingly tilting toward the latter. The global order is nearing a tipping point, and if democracy’s defenders do not work together to help guarantee freedom for all people, the authoritarian model will prevail.

Freedom scores (higher=better):

Armenia: 54/100

Nagorno-Karabakh: 37/100

Turkey: 32/100

Russia: 12/100

Azerbaijan: 9/100

12) Reforming electoral laws [opposition and the govt had agreed to lower the passing threshold to allow more opposition parties to enter Parliament, etc.]

13) Introduction of the Institute of Specialized Judges as the first step in establishing an anti-corruption courts. Launching the process to confiscate illegally embezzled property.

14) Conducting regular consultations with representatives of the Armenian political and civil community.

15) Consultations with diasporan institutes and individuals. 

The goal is to ensure the democratic stability of Armenia and to create guarantees that nothing threatens the formation of power in Armenia through the free will of the people. For this, I'll make changes to the government team. 

We will need 6 months to launch the aforementioned tasks. In June 2021, I will report to you the progress, and based on the public response, we will decide on what to do next.

**11:42 COVID stats:** +4,109 tested. +1,589 infected (down). +1,726 healed. +28 deaths.  38,082 active (down). 

**HealthMin Torosyan:** the percentage of positive tests and the absolute numbers are declining, but the healthcare system is still under stress. 

We still have 375 patients waiting for beds, 25 of whom are in serious condition. We will likely hospitalize them sometime today. A few days ago the waiting list was 800. The trend can change again with the resumption of schools. 

Our main issue right now is oxygen supplies. Without it, the medication is ineffective. We'll soon receive more oxygen stations, followed by four large stations in December. We had purchased many oxygen stations during the first wave but today's large numbers, partly a result of the war, were outside of our predications. 

We're negotiating over vaccines. There are agreements. They will likely arrive in mid-Spring.

We have no shortage of COVID test kits. New test labs are opening; two in the past week alone.

**14:05 Armenia Fund (Himnadram) report:** hundreds of thousands have donated. The aid was provided to Artsakh and Armenia from the first day of the war. 

Diesel generators, emergency vehicles, medical products, basic consumer products, heating devices, portable gas stoves, mobile fuel stations, beds, etc. were purchased during the war. Simultaneously, 100 tons of aid was coordinated.

Himnadram will help Armenia's budget to pay for social welfare, healthcare, infrastructure repair, etc. The documents are ready. Tens of thousands of Artsakh refugees were aided.

International independent auditors will examine the finances.

&nbsp;

During a Parliamentary session, the Deputy PM Mher Grigoryan confirmed that Himnadram has transferred some of the funds for humanitarian work. 

In response, former regime's HHK MP Armen Ashotyan, without evidence, claimed the money is being stolen. 

[**Context**: The former regime is mad because they were caught stealing Himnadram's donations in 2018. After the 2018 revolution, the Pashinyan administration busted HHK's Himnadram director with stealing the funds and using them on gambling. The director confessed and returned part of the stolen money. Himnadram then underwent a complete change in administration which raised the trust towards the fund. Now the former regime is sabotaging the diaspora's donation efforts for political gain.]

**18:21 Police:** body of the 27-year-old Garnik Petrosyan was found under Kievyan Bridge on November 13th. A medical examination was carried out and an investigation was launched. 

The examination revealed that Petrosyan was among the rioters who broke into the govt building and caused destruction on November 10th. A felony case was launched against him and he was arrested shortly afterward.

On November 13th he was charged with multiple felony counts. The same day, at 8 pm, his 3-day detention period had expired so he was released from the police station. The same day, prosecutors asked the court to arrest him for 2 months before his trial.

Petrosyan was questioned until 9 pm. The tragic incident happened at 10:04 pm. Social media spread rumors that he was allegedly murdered and it wasn't a suicide by jumping from the bridge. 

Investigation revealed a witness who was walking nearby and saw how a man grabbed a flag pole and climbed at the center of the bridge at around 10 pm.

##interview with ex-PM Aram Sargsyan || Nagorno-Karabakh ex-president Arayik had purchased tickets to attend Western-back negotiations; pro-Russia forces organized a coup

**Context:** Nagorno-Karabakh's opposition leader Samvel Babayan has so far revealed that, with the permission of President Arayik Harutyunyan, he was holding negotiations with Azerbaijan, and that Azerbaijan had agreed for Nagorno-Karabakh to have autonomy and its own national guard. According to Babayan, the pro-Russian former regime did not support this because they believed Russia could help them freeze the conflict so they could try to eventually gain *full* independence. To that end, the former regime removed Arayik from power, appointed their strongly pro-Russian man as president, and rejected Babayan's negotiations efforts that would have secured ""merely"" autonomy and guards. Babayan believes the former regime derailed the efforts under the orders of Russia. Babayan and Azerbaijan did not want to use Russia as a mediator.

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** Despite the ongoing forced exodus and the ethnic cleansing, this is not the end of Nagorno-Karabakh. Kosovo's Albanians had also left the region. There were 1.5 million of them. They eventually returned home. In 1999 the UN established 4 pillars (legal, security, democracy, economy) and established influence over the region.

Why didn't this happen in Nagorno-Karabakh? Because we had Russian peacekeepers instead of international, and no steps were taken to reach out to the UN's genocide prevention office despite my letters to Ruben Vardanyan and Arayik Harutyunyan [Nagorno-Karabakh leaders].

Arayik Harutyunyan had purchased tickets and was preparing to attend the Sophia negotiations hosted by the West. This was supported by Pashinyan who had ""lowered the bar"" and had been urging Nagorno-Karabakh representatives to accept being one level below an ""equal party"".

After the replacement of Arayik Harutyunyan [by pro-Russian forces], U.S. mediator Bono no longer organized a new meeting because they believed the new regime was only going to follow the Kremlin's orders. Russia did everything possible to derail the Western efforts, leading us to the war. They perhaps calculated that Armenia would get involved so Azerbaijan could forcefully take the ""Zangezur corridor"", to be controlled by Russia.

**REPORTER:** Why did the regime in Nagorno-Karabakh prefer depopulation over the Western platform?

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** Russia gave them reassurances that Nagorno-Karabakh would remain Armenian. This is why they held a maximalist stance until the end. I used to be friends with Arkadiy Ghukasyan and have spent many hours with Bako Sahakyan [the pro-Russian regime in Nagorno-Karabakh]. None of them obviously wanted this outcome. They were simply convinced that Russia wouldn't betray them so they appointed their ARF colleague.

**REPORTER:** Why did the regime trust Russia if Russia couldn't even open the Lachin corridor for 10 months or defend villages?

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** Those should have been enough to distrust Russia, but they joined Russia to criticize Armenia for everything. Every excuse was made to justify Russia's inaction. Who are the street protesters blaming today? Armenia, of course. 

**REPORTER:** Why didn't Armenia intervene in Nagorno-Karabakh?

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** Synchronous work was necessary between the governments in Yerevan and Stepanakert. If the Nagorno-Karabakh government adopted a maximalist stance, did they first ensure that Armenia would intervene to help in the event their plan backfired? Was Armenia supposed to lose Syunik, too?

**REPORTER:** Will AM-AZ sign an agreement during the upcoming meeting hosted by the West?

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** They could sign an agreement recognizing borders under the 1991 agreement. This would address 70% of the issues. This would allow Armenia to develop its economy. The U.S. envoy brought an economic package with them. They are negotiating with the government to build semiconductors, memory chips, and capsular nuclear plants in Armenia. There is also a military element in the package. //

##around half of the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh have been forced to flee to Armenia due to unlivable conditions created by Azerbaijan

54,000 refugees entered Armenia as of Wednesday afternoon. Around half of them have been registered while the other half chose not to because they went straight to their families already residing in Armenia. 

The registered refugees will be given food stamps and eventually housing in nearby settlements in Gegharkunik, Vayots Dzor, and Syunik.

The government urges the unregistered refugees to also contact authorities so they can receive other forms of assistance.

##Azerbaijan has agreed to an international observer mission in Nagorno-Karabakh, we expect them to abide by that: says U.S. State Department while Azerbaijan insists there is ""no need"" to send observers 

**STATE DEPT:** Aliyev has said there will be no further military action and that he would accept an international observer mission. We expect him to abide by that. Blinken spoke with Aliyev and underscored the urgency of no further hostilities and that there be unconditional protection and freedom of movement for civilians and unhindered humanitarian access.

**REPORTER:** Can you describe what the monitoring mission will look like? Have you been able to test the waters with both Yerevan and Baku?

**STATE DEPT:** The exact mechanism is something that remains in discussion with our partners so I don’t want to preview what it might look like before we finish those conversations.

**AZERBAIJAN:** We will allow the entry of an Azerbaijan-based UN Coordinator, but there is no need for a broader monitoring mission.

**GERMANY:** Nobody truly understands what's happening in Nagorno-Karabakh. Thousands of residents are afraid for their lives. They see the road to Armenia as the only solution. The numbers are growing.

We are working with our partners to send an international mission to Nagorno-Karabakh. If Azerbaijan allows it, it will show they are serious about ensuring the safety and well-being of the population. In Nagorno-Karabakh, there is currently a lack of almost everything necessary for a dignified life: food, medicine, and hygiene items. //

U.S. Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri Kim and USAID chief Samantha Power have arrived in Azerbaijan to discuss a ""stable and dignified peace"" between Armenians and Azeris.

##Armenia takes first official step to downgrade ties to Russia-led CSTO military bloc: source

According to Factor.am sources, Armenia will not appoint a new ambassador to CSTO. The ambassador was recalled last month. At the time many believed it was part of the ongoing diplomatic reshuffling process. 

Despite the contractual obligations, CSTO refused to provide military assistance to Armenia when Azerbaijan invaded Armenia proper in 2021 and 2022. Yerevan also accused CSTO of refusing to acknowledge that Armenia proper was invaded. 

Pashinyan has since refused to host CSTO exercises in Armenia, and refused to invite CSTO's border observers to Armenia: *""If you don't even acknowledge where the border is, what are you going to monitor?""*

In contrast, the EU has openly acknowledged and condemned the invasion of Armenia proper. Pashinyan subsequently invited EU observers to monitor the borders. Their mission was extended.

Vardanyan was [attempting to enter](https://youtu.be/1sGN0PPMbeY?t=67) Armenia by crossing the checkpoint illegally installed by Azerbaijan on the Lachin corridor several months ago. He was taken to Baku.

Armenia has contacted the European Court of Human Rights to request information from Azerbaijan and ""to protect Vardanyan's rights"".

**RUSSIA:** We can't bail him out because he is no longer a Russian citizen. //

**MARGARITA SIMONYAN:** It is terrifying to imagine what fate awaits Vardanyan in Azerbaijan. And Vardanyan, a world-class billionaire, an employer of George Clooney and others, did it all voluntarily. He left his comfortable life and Russian citizenship behind to help Karabakh. [After the war] everyone called and begged Vardanyan to return. They offered him assistance to return. But he preferred to remain where his people were. //

##ex-mayor Hayk Marutyan has agreed to join the pro-Russian former regime and a party of fugitives to become Yerevan mayor and later remove Pashinyan from power

Marutyan will need 33 Council votes to become Yerevan mayor. For that, he needs the support of the former regime (Tevanyan) and a party of fugitives (Dog).

The pro-Russian former regime wants Marutyan to help them remove Pashinyan. Marutyan has agreed that Pashinyan's removal will be their next step. Not through the streets, but through elections.

The party of fugitives wants its members to be assigned to supervisory roles. Marutyan promises to assign them as long as they pass through the necessary competition process. He also promises to create a new monitoring commission and appoint Dog's people to lead it.

The council will hold a vote to elect a mayor in a few days.

##IMF suspends $280M assistance programme to Georgia after its refusal to impose U.S. sanctions on former chief prosecutor

Georgia's central bank wants to ""shield"" the ex-Prosecutor General Otar Partskhaladze from sanctions imposed by the U.S. State Department.

The central bank administration argues that a court order is necessary before it can impose the sanctions. Some bank officials resigned in protest.

Currently, candidates for school director are required to present a plan of action on how to develop the school, but this process is flawed and often results in candidates copy-pasting another school's plans which may not be suited for their school.
 
The new law will regulate this process. The candidate will have to meet students and parent councils to receive approval for the proposed plan. Upon election as a director, their job assessment will be done by checking the progress towards the plan. The director can receive a vote of no-confidence if fails.
 
The Ministry expects better long-term results for schools and improved efficiency in governance.
 
The directors will need to present a 5-year plan of development, analysis of the current situation, revealing weak and strong points, resource assessment, setting goals, plan of action, risk assessment, budget management, etc.

1/7/2022,"Armenia, coerced into becoming a Putin puppet state. What do you guys think about the geopolitical situation?","As a Belgian who loves both Georgia and Armenia, it's sad to see how Armenia seems to have no other choice than to become a puppet state of Putin. Armenia can't bend towards the West without risking a full on invasion, as the West is unable and seemingly unwilling to defend Armenia against Turkish and Azeri acts of aggression. Armenia cannot risk to lose Russia as an ally, as it would mean the death sentence for Armenia as an independent country. So the only way for Armenia to survive, seems to be assisting a dictator when he is actively suppressing the will of the Kazakh people. They legitimately protest against their corrupt and authoritarian leader, but are forced to remain in a dictatorship because it suits Russia better. The same has happened in Belarus, which would have ousted Lukashenko if Putin did not intervene. It might even have been closer to something of a democracy by now. The Kazakhs don't stand any chance now. I see how Turkish people suffer under Erdogan, how Russian people suffer under Putin and how Armenians suffer from both. One would almost wish that Armenia was geographically positioned in the center of the European Union. Things would have been way easier. What do you think of this situation? Are there illogical inconsistenties in my geopolitical view?"

Now, my family and I have never been to Armenia (which is where our ancestors are from). We were going to go in 2019, but my grandpa passed. Before he passed, he pulled me aside and told me to go to Armenia as soon as I can. 2020-2022 COVID happened and cases were bad there. Now, were thinking of going in October of this year but im so scared to book and pick a flight because im scared that will be my last time alive. I am dyinggggg to see Armenia, at least once. And i know itll be memorable with my family. The flight is NOT direct. So i could go from Toronto (where I live) to France (air france) about a 7 hr flight, where we would wait for 3 hrs and then take another flight to Armenia which is like 3 hours. Ive googled air france and ive read that it is a safe plane and all but i remember they had this one major crash and ive been scared of that plane ever since. 

Any advice? I do not want to regret not going to see the motherland. I want to go. "

**Is he not allowed to enter Azerbaijan?**

Back in 2015 when Borussia Dortmund had to face Gabala in Azerbaijan, UEFA told him that he would get a special visa if he would want to go. We can only assume this would have applied again this year. He decided not to go to Azerbaijan himself.

**Why wouldn't he want to go to Azerbaijan to play in the Finals of the Europa League?**

Multiple reasons come to mind. First and foremost, his safety cannot be guaranteed. Armenia and Azerbaijan have a complicated relationship (read: hateful) due to a conflict in the early 90's concerning a territory which was part of Azerbaijan but ethnically Armenian. The Armenians of the region tried to secede through a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Nagorno-Karabakh_independence_referendum), but the government of Azerbaijan refused to recognize this referendum and rescinded the autonomy of the region, after which war broke out. At the end of the active fighting, Armenians controlled the territory and some surrounding lowlands which used to be inhabited by Azerbaijanis. [Here's a map of the current situation.](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oorlog_in_Nagorno-Karabach#/media/File:Az-qa-location-fr.svg) A lot of bad things happened during the war, including more than 5 massacres against Armenians and one big massacre against Azerbaijanis. All of this contributed to the toxic situation we have at the present time.

Due to this conflict, [hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Armenian_sentiment_in_Azerbaijan#Post-1994_era) of Armenians is widespread in Azerbaijan. Regular Armenians are not allowed to enter the country at all. This policy goes as far as detaining Russian and Estonian citizens with Armenian sounding surnames for hours and  refusing to let them enter the country. [Here is an example of a Russian citizen being deported because of their surname ending in -yan.](https://www.kadamov.com/2018/05/15/azerbaijan-again-deported-citizen-of-russia-because-of-armenian-last-name/) For the record, such a policy does not exist in Armenia; Azerbaijanis are allowed to enter without any problems.

A case which symbolizes the ubiquity of Armenophobia in Azerbaijan is the murder of Gurgen Margaryan. Back in 2004, Gurgen (an Armenian soldier) was in Hungary to participate in the NATO Partnership for Peace Program. While there, an Azerbaijani participant of the same program [axed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramil_Safarov#Budapest_murder) him to death in his sleep. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Hungary.

 In 2012 however, Hungary agreed to extradite him in order to sit out the rest of his sentence in an Azerbaijani jail. When he arrived at the airport in Baku he was instead pardoned immediately by the president. He received a hero's welcome including back pay for the 8 years he served in a Hungarian prison and he was promoted to the rank of major and on top of it all he received an appartment from the government [(source)](https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2060913.html). People at the highest offices in Azerbaijan reacted positively to all of this, with the Commissioner for Human Rights in Azerbaijan being quoted to say ""Ramil Safarov must set an example of patriotism for the Azerbaijani youth""[(source)](https://books.google.nl/books?id=DGx22yH4VBEC&pg=PA628&lpg=PA628&dq=elmira+suleymanova+ramil+safarov&source=bl&ots=CDwAycd2zE&sig=ACfU3U1-A5uv_8wUrHlsT0o8olxJXe685Q&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjF5I350pDiAhXQaFAKHbtkARMQ6AEwB3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=elmira%20suleymanova%20ramil%20safarov&f=false). [Here](http://budapest.sumgait.info/azerbaijani-response.htm) are some more responses of Azerbaijani officials. I hope you can understand why he wouldn't want to go to a country which glorifies the murder of a sleeping Armenian to such an extent.

**Conclusion**

Only Mkhitaryan himself knows why we will or won't go, but I believe I have shown you plenty of reasons for him not to go. Whether it is solidarity with the other Armenians not allowed to enter the country, or the response to/active fostering of Anti-Armenian sentiment by their government, I personally believe he shouldn't go. I hope this gives enough information on the decision that he will have to make."

5/10/2021,Foreigner here with a question: why do people blame Pashinyan for the losses in Nagorno-Karabakh?,"On coming into leadership in 2018 (off the back of an impactful revolution), was he supposed to ramp up military spending in anticipation of a potential resurgence of conflict in N-K? As far as I can tell, Azerbaijan were way to far ahead in the ""arms race"" for Armenia to catch up (unless you were willing to spend an exorbitant amount of money). Would the electorate even be pleased with military spending considering the myriad other issues I'm sure Armenia still has to contend with?

As for his decision to concede some of the territory of N-K -- what's the alternative? He continues to send soldiers to their deaths, all on the slim possibility that they can escape Turkish drones and hold the territory. The battle was lost; he saved lives by capitulating. How would any other leader handle this differently, considering the resources at hand?"
4/17/2023,Need information about churches located in Kessab asap!,"Hey guys, I am a descendant of Syrian-Armenians from my father's side, who moved to Armenia from Kessab in 1947. Recently I've been doing a lot of work in order to dig up some information, but sadly all I can find here in Armenia are the records of the immigration of my great-grandfather's family. All of them were born in Kessab and moved to Armenia as adults. So, I assume that churches should have records of births, marriages and deaths of my relatives. The last paternal ancestor of mine that I know is my great-great-grandfather who was born in Kessab and was buried there as well. Can someone please provide me contacts of Armenian churches in Kessab as I couldn't find any? Also, I'd like to mention that I am a direct descendant and I do have all the documented proofs of relation (aside from the fact that I hold the same last-name).

**Demanding End to U.S. Assistance for Azerbaijan**

**Washington, D.C. –** Today, the bipartisan co-chairs of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues U.S. Representatives Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.), Gus M. Bilirakis (R-Fla.), Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), and David G. Valadao (R-Calif.) introduced a resolution condemning Azerbaijan’s unprovoked military attacks on Armenia and Artsakh and demanding the Biden administration immediately withhold further assistance to Azerbaijan.

“We strongly condemn the deadly attacks by Azeri forces in sovereign Armenian territory. This egregious escalation of Azeri violence shows just how emboldened the Aliyev regime has become when its unprovoked aggression is met by deafening silence and false equivocations from the international community – empowering Azerbaijan to continue and expand its attacks. We call on the Biden administration and State Department to unequivocally condemn Azerbaijan’s actions and cease all assistance to the Aliyev regime immediately. And we stand firmly with the people of Armenia and Artsakh in support of their territorial integrity, and their right to peace and freedom,” **Schiff, Pallone, Bilirakis, Speier and Valadao said in a statement.**

On September 13th, Azerbaijan launched an unprovoked assault on sovereign Armenian territory with intensive shelling and drone attacks on the villages of Karmir Shuka and Taghavard in Artsakh, and the Armenian border cities of Vardenis, Jermuk, Goris, and Tatev – reportedly resulting in the deaths of at least 105 Armenian soldiers.

The attacks come nearly two years after Azerbaijan launched a massive and unprovoked military assault on the Nagorno-Karabakh region in September 2020, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Armenian civilians and soldiers, the displacement of tens of thousands more civilians, and the ongoing detention of more than 100 prisoners of war. Azerbaijan’s aggression has continued unabated in the years since, despite them signing a November 2020 ceasefire agreement with Armenia to end the Nagorno-Karabakh war.

Despite Azerbaijan’s ongoing and well-documented offensive uses of force against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, the State Department has continued to provide military assistance to Azerbaijan by waiving Section 907 of the *Freedom Support Act*.

Specifically, the resolution:

* Condemns Azerbaijan for its September 13, 2022 unprovoked military attack on Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and calls for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire;
* Urges President Biden to immediately cease all assistance to Azerbaijan pursuant to Section 907 of the *Freedom Support Act* and for the Administration to make clear to President Aliyev that further attacks on Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh will result in sanctions or other measures;
* Reaffirms the United States’ decisive support of Armenia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and its firm opposition against Azerbaijan’s military aggression and blatant violations of international laws and norms; and
* Supports U.S. and international humanitarian assistance programs to meet the urgent needs of victims of Azerbaijani aggression in both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.

##interview with Ruben Rubinyan, Armenia's special envoy for dialogue with Turkey  

[Read the Friday digest for context](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/vparca/jul12022_news_sending_stray_dogs_to_guard_borders/).

##... when?

The sooner the better. Hopefully this summer. 

##... who will be allowed to cross the Armenia-Turkey border?

Anyone who is not a citizen of Armenia and Turkey. The issue of including or excluding dual citizens will be discussed later. There are many tourists who would like to cross from Armenia to Turkey, or vice versa, via land. A tourist in Yerevan could decide to visit Van before leaving. A tourist in Kars could want to visit Gyumri before leaving. There are many diasporan Armenians who might want to do this.

##... how and where will the border crossing take place?

The technical details will be discussed soon, now that a political agreement is reached. We have our preferences on where the crossings should be organized.

##... about cargo transfers. Today we import Turkish goods via Georgia and other countries. Turkey was a top-5 trade partner of Armenia. 

There will be a direct cargo transfer between Armenia and Turkey. We're talking about cargo jets or passenger jets carrying cargo. Logically, Turkey and Armenia would recognize each other's product barcodes.

##... have you considered the risks associated with possible economic ""expansionism""?

Obviously. Every country can use tools to protect itself against economic expansionism. Today almost every country has open borders with its neighbors. 

##... the meetings were first held in Moscow, but have since been moved to Vienna. Is Moscow ""out"" as a mediator?

There is no mediator. Vienna is just a city where Armenia and Turkey meet. Moscow kickstarted the process, and we're grateful for that.

##... Erdogan recently said it's not necessary to involve 3rd countries to normalize AM-TR relations 

If Turkey wants to hold these meetings in Turkey or Armenia, instead of Vienna, that means they want this process to be truly bilateral. In that case, it's strange that certain Turkish officials publicly announce that they are ""coordinating"" the Armenia-Turkey efforts with Armenia-Azerbaijan efforts. 

We offered Turkey to open the land border for officials with diplomatic passports. It would be a small step with a big symbolic and practical significance. If Turkey wants the meetings to be held in Yerevan or Ankara, it would be logical for them to agree to this. 

##... during the discussions, has the Turkish envoy ever promoted Azerbaijan's position?

No. These are two separate processes. They have not made such remarks during the face-to-face talks. Only some Turkish officials, outside of these talks, have spoken about Turkey ""coordinating"" this with Azerbaijan.

##... do you feel international support during this process?

Yes. We've received positive support from global players to promote this process.

##... the street opposition has been accusing you of ""Turkifying"" Armenia and not defending our interests 

I was following them at first but have since lost interest. Their claims should at least be somewhat backed up by facts. As we've said, there have not been any preconditions during these talks.

##... the opposition claims you are betraying the Genocide recognition

They need to back it up with facts. Turkish envoy hasn't even asked us to ease the international pressure on them. 

##... are you giving a ""corridor""?

This is probably the 1,000th time we've announced that no ""corridor"" was/is being discussed. 

##... about opposition's complaints about ""Turkish expansionism""

In 1920 Dashnaks asked Turkey for weapons to fight against the Bolsheviks. Was that a ""Turkification"" of Armenia? When the Kocharyan-ARF alliance launched the process that would later become the ""Soccer Diplomacy"" under Serj, was that a ""Turkification""? When the Serj administration signed the Zurich protocols and conducted the Soccer Diplomacy, was that ""Turkification""? So when FM Ararat Mirzoyan attends Turkey for a forum that's considered ""Turkification"", but not when Serj visits Turkey. Their entire career is built on fluffing up a non-issue and fighting against it.

##who will be the mayor of Ani, Shirak?

Municipal elections will be held later this year. Ani municipality was enlarged to include 17 settlements. The main competitors are expected to be QP, ARF, and HHK.

The incumbent is HHK Artak Gevorgyan, who has decided to run for reelection. After the 2018 revolution and the subsequent anti-corruption movements across Armenia, the residents of Ani also launched a campaign to remove their mayor, accusing him of corruption and bribery. Authorities launched an investigation and pressed criminal charges. Gevorgyan refused to resign amid the protests, but the residents didn't allow him to return to his office. The standoff lasted 2 years. The protests resumed in June 2021 after the residents claimed the mayor was abusing administrative resources to assist the Kocharyan-ARF alliance.

QP will nominate Arman Saribekyan to challenge the embattled incumbent. Saribekyan is the manager of HayPost branches in several locations. 

ARF has not named its candidate yet.

##Nikol Pashinyan wins the defamation lawsuit filed against him by embattled Constitutional Court judge Hrayr Tovmasyan 

A few years ago Pashinyan claimed that after the revolution, judge Tovmasyan (ex-HHK MP) offered his ""services"" during a private meeting. Tovmasyan denied offering ""services"" and sued Pashinyan for alleged defamation. As ""evidence"", Pashinyan showed a pen and claimed it was a symbolic gift from Tovmasyan.

The lower court had sided with Tovmasyan, but the Appeals court overruled it. 

Pashinyan will not have to apologize. Tovmasyan will have to pay him $20 as compensation for registration fees.

##Armenia celebrated the Constitution Day 

**Reporter:** What day is today?

**Random citizen:** Tuesday.

**Reporter:** Have you read the Constitution?

**Random citizen:** No.

The Constitution was adopted in 1995 and amended in 2005 and 2015. Today the president issued medals and promotions to several officials at NSS, police, justice ministry, IRS, etc.

##... NGOs and lawyers met on Tuesday [for 6 hours](https://youtu.be/71kFIQkf0PY) to discuss the upcoming Constitutional reforms

**Yeghishe Kirakosyan:** When you have a clear connection between various layers of society and the experts involved in the reforms, you end up having an inclusive reform process. I'm glad that today we have a transparent reform process. We've seen that closed processes don't lead to anything good.

##... Reform Council member Yeghoryan [shares details](https://youtu.be/nCQsYLA-Ew8) about previous constitutional reforms and why they were made:

About the 1995 Constitution. The reform panel spent 3 years consulting with international experts, but some suggestions were ignored. The emphasis was placed on the French model. Certain articles were at the time included for specific individuals. For example, the president would need to be a resident of Armenia for at least 10 years. This was written specifically for Levon Ter-Petrosyan. My father [also a Reform Council member at the time] wanted the president to be born and raised in Armenia. 

My father wanted to promote the institute of parties. He believed that [Levon's] HHsH had turned into a giant and it would destroy the entire political system in Armenia. He attempted to reform the Constitution in a way to allow blocs to be formed to defeat party totalitarianism. This is why they added the article about MP's ability to vote independently from the party.

Certain parts of the Constitution worked well until 2000. That's why they decided to amend it in 2005. The main purpose was to strengthen president Kocharyan's powers. They told fairy tales about it becoming a ""semi-presidential"" system. They destroyed Article 47's checks and balances, giving more power to the Executive. So if the parliament didn't give ""confidence"" to the government, the parliament would be dissolved. 

With the amendments, Kocharyan strengthened his powers so he could overcome the parliament, which was a threat to him starting 1999, even though the main opponents were already dead. To justify the power-grabbing amendments, they copied human rights-related articled and claimed that was the main purpose of the referendum.

##Pashinyan about the Constitution and parliamentary vs presidential system: 

Congratulations on Constitution Day. The non-amendable articles have formed the national vision of our Republic, defining it as a sovereign, democratic, social, and legal state, where the power belongs to the People, who exercise this power through free elections and referendums.

You are aware that a [Constitutional Reforms Council](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/su72bl/news_digest_feb162022_documentary_about_terrorist/) and an expert body were formed. By the end of this year, they will present a draft concept of necessary reforms. 

The Constitution needs to constantly develop and improve. At the same time, I believe we should maintain the parliamentary system of government because the events of 2021 have shown that this system is capable of withstanding shocks and provides the tools for public discourse and participation.

I congratulate you again. I hope that the law will become, if not the only, then at least a decisive factor in regulating our public and civil relations. //

##only days left until the collapse of the Pashinyan regime

After it became clear the street protests had failed to pick up steam, the protest leaders were asked to comment on why Pashinyan hasn't yet resigned despite their claims that the administration's days were numbered thanks to a ""paralyzed city"" and ""control over the streets"". The opposition responded, ""the struggle continues"".

**Pashinyan's chief of staff:** Last month, one of the opposition leaders used his network in Los Angeles to circulate rumors that the government had decided to resign. Here is a story regarding that MP.

On June 2nd, one of my friends in the US, who is a business owner, wrote that the opposition is using its network in L.A. to claim that there is a 100% chance the government will soon resign and that it has been confirmed that the power will be transferred to the street opposition.

My friend also told me that many similar business owners, who had made large investments in Armenia and were happy with the Pashinyan administration, were concerned about their investments amid the reports of resignation. 

I told them that if they trusted the reports from the opposition, that means they aren't truly ""good"" businessmen because they can't analyze a situation properly. Finita la comedia. //

##Azerbaijan is concerned that the Caspian Sea, at least parts of it, could dry out in the near future and cause major problems

Azeri scientists met to discuss ecological issues relating to the Caspian Sea. They are concerned about the oil industry's impact. There are geological hazards associated with seabed deformation.

The water levels fluctuate dramatically. It was 2 meters higher a century ago. There was a 1.5m drop in the 1930s, followed by a 2.7 rise in the 80s-90s.

Starting 2005, the levels have been dropping by 10cm annually. If the trend continues, within the next 30 years the northern parts will become like the Aral Sea, they fear.

They believe the drop in water levels will cause significant problems for port operators and wildlife.

##Armenian soccer player Sargis Adamyan joins FC Köln

The 29yo attacker is moving from Hoffenheim to Koln (German league). The contract is valid until 2026. 

**Koln boss:** We are very pleased with the transfer. Sargis is a great player and a great person who is down-to-earth and loyal. His aggressive sprint-intensive work against the ball, and one-on-ones, are his key traits. He can play in almost every attacking position. // >!You better pay him good then.!< 

Sargis was born in Yerevan and moved to Germany with family at the age of 5. He has since played in several Bundesliga teams.

In FC Hoffenheim he played 53 times, scored 11 goals, and made 5 goal assists.

When he was loaned to Belgium's Club Brugge (current champions), he played 16 times and scored 6 goals.

**FM Ghazaryan:** The cause of every third death is hunger and malnutrition. We only have a reserve of flour and bread for a few more days. 

Families are separated. Hospitals cannot function normally. Land cannot be cultivated because of fuel shortage.

Those who can cultivate their land are regularly attacked by Azerbaijani soldiers who seek to prevent any kind of economic activity to further aggravate hunger.

Leading international experts define the situation as genocide. Azerbaijan is using the famine as a tool to exterminate Armenians. This is a humanitarian catastrophe. The world must show political will. It is necessary to take immediate measures to end the blockade, otherwise, it will be too late.

(1) Adopt a UN Security Council resolution demanding Azerbaijan open the Lachin corridor.

(2) Sanction Azerbaijani leadership.

(3) Send humanitarian aid via air or land.

We call on the free and progressive world to prevent the genocide. //

##UN Security Council members should take measures to prevent a new explosion in the South Caucasus: PM Pashinyan 

**PASHINYAN:** The military-political situation has significantly worsened over the past week. Azerbaijan is accumulating troops along the Nagorno-Karabakh contact line and the AM-AZ border. The rhetoric of anti-Armenian hatred has intensified in the Azerbaijani press. The policy of encroachment on the sovereign territory of Armenia continues.

Azerbaijan continues to illegally block the Lachin Corridor. The humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh has reached its peak. 

It is obvious that Azerbaijan plans to launch a new military provocation against Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. To justify such provocation, false theses are put into circulation.

The international community and member states of the UN Security Council should take serious measures to prevent a new explosion in our region.

To address the rights and security of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, the NK-AZ dialogue within the framework of the international mechanism, and the unblocking of the Lachin Corridor are essential.

At the same time, I emphasize the commitment of Armenia towards the agreements reached earlier. Armenia is ready and wants to sign a peace treaty normalizing relations with Azerbaijan. //

##interview with Nagorno-Karabakh's main opposition figure Samvel Babayan: president's resignation, Agdam road, NK-AZ negotiation document

Read the [Monday report](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16ag0hi/nagornokarabakh_oppo_leader_samvel_babayan_says/) if you missed the bombshell revelations made by Babayan about the transition of power, the Agdam road, and the document he sent to Azerbaijan.

**REPORTER:** What effect will Arayik's resignation have on your political activities? There has been a shift in balance.

**BABAYAN:** Russian FSB's 5th department is tasked with the activities in Nagorno-Karabakh. They decide whether Arayik leaves, who becomes the next leader, etc. There is no big politics here. They are simply changing the actor with Arayik's resignation. 

Earlier they deployed Ruben Vardanyan to help Arayik with governance. It only made us more isolated. This clan doesn't want to admit their actions have harmed us so they're trying to change the president instead. Now they have a replacement who is also part of the former regime.

This will lead to major problems for Nagorno-Karabakh. They are cooling the negotiation process instead of activating it to resolve the issues. They'd rather negotiate about minor issues relating to trucks here and there.

This is a crime against the people and it won't resolve anything. We must have a more comprehensive negotiation document, we must negotiate ourselves, and this must be done immediately. 

But the clan in power was told [by Russia] that they are good agents and must continue to govern. It's not the Russian state per se that's doing this, it's the 5th department of the FSB, which is responsible for activities in ex-Soviet republics. All the decisions are made by the FSB and implemented by their agents here. 

Russia has reassured Azerbaijan that the Agdam road will open in a few days from now. These are not politicians. They are criminals. They are direct agents of a foreign power and therefore must be dealt with. 

**REPORTER:** By FSB's 5th department, do you mean the pro-Russian ""5th column""?

**BABAYAN:** No, no, no. It's an actual FSB department.

**REPORTER:** Did they replace Arayik with someone else to [prevent you from having the opportunity to come to power]?

**BABAYAN:** No. Arayik was unable to carry out his duties. Russia had demanded Nagorno-Karabakh to allow Azerbaijani trucks to enter from Agdam, followed by the opening of Lachin. Russia believed this would lower the tensions. Their plan is to take incremental steps here and there to drag this conflict down as long as possible ""until the good days"".

However, some political forces were publicly against Arayik opening the Agdam road. ARF and Ruben Vardanyan installed road barricades on the Agdam road. But these forces later met Arayik's replacement who told them that ""we have no choice but to open the Agdam road and hold negotiations with Azeris in Yevlakh [Azerbaijan]"".

Remember how they were calling those a ""red line""? Today it's a ""green line"". Why did they agree? Because everyone has already successfully received their chairs in the government. 

The opposition parties in Armenia must come clean and publicly admit that their puppets in Nagorno-Karabakh have agreed to the Agdam road and Yevlakh negotiations. They should stop calling me a traitor [for wanting to negotiate with Azerbaijan directly]. The real traitors are them and their puppets.

**REPORTER:** What is the outcome of this political change in Nagorno-Karabakh? 

**BABAYAN:** The current frozen state in Nagorno-Karabakh doesn't allow Armenia to sign a peace treaty with Azerbaijan and establish relations with Turkey. Constant border clashes. Constant threat of Azerbaijani troop accumulation on borders. Constant tension. They think they can drag this long enough until they see ""better days"", but in reality, they will drag it long enough until Russia improves relations with Azerbaijan and decides to gift the entire Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan, just as they have done throughout our history. 

That's why I'm against the strategy of delaying things. I urge people to understand the severity of the issue and stand up to these foreign agents. This conflict can be resolved. They have instead further complicated it. 

**REPORTER:** There are certain reports that the future of several politicians is in danger. There are circles who do not want you to come to power under any circumstances. Are you afraid of being assassinated?

**BABAYAN:** My entire life has been one risky journey. If I go, I'm going to take them with me. I will put them down right inside their houses. That's why they understand they need to behave. The monkeys who claim I'm organizing a bloody coup against the regime are mistaken. The public must take to the streets and boycott the [""transfer of power"" on September 8th]. I'm not a presidential candidate myself because their passport department refused to certify me. It'll be litigated in court.

Their replacement guy Shahramanyan has the support of 22 MPs right now. That's the minimum required to be elected as president. I think there is a chance he might not receive all 22 and there will be a second vote.

They are lying to the public that ""freezing"" the conflict will help. It won't. They might bring a few trucks here and there with the help of Russia, but pretty soon Azerbaijan won't agree to these activities and Russia's attempts to further freeze the conflict. We must negotiate peace right now.

**REPORTER:** Lavrov's plan envisages the subjugation of Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan with very limited cultural autonomy. Would the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh agree to live under those conditions?

**BABAYAN:** As I've said in my previous interviews, Lavrov's plan is intentionally made terrible so Nagorno-Karabakh wouldn't agree to it. It's a distraction, an attempt to delay the peace process. 

**REPORTER:** Did you secretly send your negotiation package to Azerbaijan without consulting with others?

**BABAYAN:** There have been accusations that I submitted my plan to Azerbaijan independently, without authorization. Do you know who is complaining about it? Ruben Vardanyan, the guy who landed in Nagorno-Karabakh with a ""parachute"". He doesn't understand that I know this country and the conflict much better than him. 

Vardanyan called for me to be ""punished"" for sending the documents to Azerbaijan. Listen, foreign agent, you are the one who must be punished for being a spy and leading us into isolation. You must answer for it. 

I had President Arayik's authorization to send the documents to Azerbaijan. We haven't received a response to some of the paragraphs yet.

We must not under any circumstances allow the Russian plan of ""freezing"" the situation. If we choose direct negotiations with Azerbaijan instead, it is possible to receive the maximum possible autonomy. I can officially declare that right now. 

I've already explained why the clan is against this. The illiterate [Russian] agents are following orders [from Moscow] instead. They don't understand what they are doing.

**REPORTER:** So you sent your document to Azerbaijan separately, without the knowledge of other political parties?

**BABAYAN:** I've been working on it over the past 3 years, since the war. We've discussed it during Security Council meetings, with the Foreign Ministry, etc. For a while, they ignored my plan. President Arayik eventually agreed to discuss and send that package to Azerbaijan. 

**REPORTER:** What are the chances that *this* was the reason why they replaced Arayik? His cooperation with you...

**BABAYAN:** No. Arayik's removal has nothing to do with my negotiation plan. On August 16th a group of businessmen with Nagorno-Karabakh origins, with the participation of Rusian FSB's 5th department, decided to remove Arayik. The idiot deserves it. 

The clan understands that they can't play the same games with me if I'm the president, so they are working against me. We have too many foreign agents. I'm going to launch and conclude this process until the end. We will negotiate with Azerbaijan to find solutions. 

**REPORTER:** Why aren't there 40,000 people outside of your window with demands to appoint you as the leader and overrule your ""passport rejection""?

**BABAYAN:** The clan has raped and plundered the country for 23 years. They are obviously afraid of facing accountability if I come to power. They don't care about Nagorno-Karabakh. They each own a mansion in Yerevan. Maintain the crisis here to be able to overthrow the government in Armenia by claiming they surrendered Nagorno-Karabakh. That's their plan.

##why is Armenia delaying the appointment of a representative to the Russian bloc CSTO?

**KHANDANYAN, ruling party MP:** There is a technical procedure to appoint a candidate. I don't know who and when will be appointed. //

Context: Armenia recalled its representative to the Russia-led military bloc to appoint him as an ambassador elsewhere. The representative was not recalled ""for consultations"", indicating that it might be a regular diplomatic reshuffling rather than a political gesture against Russia.

##... why did Armenia-Russia relations worsen suddenly?

**KHANDANYAN:** There has been no substantive change in the recent period. Since 2022 Armenia has voiced about Russia's inaction in the Lachin corridor and the insufficient response to the invasion of Armenia proper. We did not receive the response we were expecting from CSTO and Russia.

##Pashinyan goes apeshit after learning how tiny Armenia's embassy was in the UK

We learned on [Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16bxdj6/letter_sent_to_uns_genocide_prevention_office/) that Armenia is buying a $22 million 5-storey building in downtown London to upgrade its embassy.

**PASHINYAN:** We are very grateful to the [local Armenian organization that was essentially donating the area for the current embassy] but we've been wanting to upgrade the embassy for quite some time now. Those who have visited the embassy, and based on the photos I've seen, no self-respecting country can operate an embassy in such conditions. 

We have this issue in many places. Our embassy is a single pew with the flag next to it. I have instructed to ensure that Armenia has proper embassies everywhere. This is mandatory if we want the diplomatic work to be effective. 

It's impossible to understand how our embassy in the UK was in this condition all these years. Missing windows, leaky roofs, and holes in the floor are unacceptable from now on.
 
The new embassy building in London will be the property of the Republic of Armenia. There were negotiations around another property deal that didn't go through, so we went with this option. 

We paid attention to the selection of the district, the street name, its prestige among business and diplomatic communities, etc. It matters because it defines whether [important figures] will accept our invitation to visit the embassy or not, and the impression they will form about Armenia and our diplomatic services. 

If you think $22 million is too much, remember the famous asatsvatsq: ""We are not rich enough to buy cheap things."" Having a Republic is an expensive luxury. //

Azerbaijan has charged an activist with espionage after she allegedly sent information to Armenian intel agents disguised as a Telegram user wanting to meet. The activist denies knowingly sending info to Armenian agents, but she admits that someone who claimed to be Russian had asked her to photograph and send certain information.

This scheme was earlier used by Azeri intel to gather info about Armenia. 

The activist was one of the people who shut down the Lachin corridor in December 2022. Some of these activists, who were in reality paid agents sent by the Azerbaijani government, later complained that the government refused to pay them for the time spent blocking the corridor.

##small sellers in Armenia complain that Russia's ""Amazon"" is driving them out of business  

Wildberries is Russia's largest online retailer. It's popular in ex-Soviet republics. It has operated in Armenia since 2018 and established local warehouses in 2022-2023 to simplify logistics and expedite delivery.

Small sellers in Armenia complain about being outpriced by the giant. They held a protest in front of the gov't building on Thursday with demands to shut down the giant's physical facilities in Armenia. 

Wildberries has admitted that a ""technical glitch"" had caused certain items in Armenia to be sold at a steep discount. Local small sellers aren't satisfied. They see a threat in the consumers' ability to purchase cheaper goods online.

**REPORTER:** Can you explain how a product imported by Wildberries from Russia to Armenia is so much cheaper than locally sold prices?

**KEROBYAN:** Last year we created conditions to ensure the IRS treats every business equally. When the Armenian consumer buys something from Wildberries, the company now pays VAT to Armenia's IRS. 
Many of our smaller businesses don't pay this VAT, which actually puts Wildberries at a disadvantage. 

Products from Wildberries are cheaper because it is a very big retailer. This is expected. It's the economy of scale. They get the products at a discount price because they buy them in bulk.

**REPORTER:** Are you going to solve this problem?

**KEROBYAN:** We are studying the complaints submitted by several local businesses. We'll see if there are anti-competitive practices. The businesses should contact the Competition Protection Committee directly.

**REPORTER:** But how can the products imported by Wildberries be so much cheaper?

**KEROBYAN:** Wildberries buys and imports them in bulk. They often buy them directly from the factory, whereas small sellers buy them from a reseller who is a reseller.

##first-ever satellite made in Armenia will fly to space with the help of SpaceX: PHOTO/VIDEO

Armenia-based Bazoomq space research laboratory is working on a CubeSat-style satellite called Hayasat-1. It's a joint project with the Center for Scientific Innovation and Education (led by a diasporan) to train satellite engineers in Armenia. 

It will be tested this month and released in October through Falcon-9. The knowledge will allow the team to work on larger projects later. 

The 1 kg satellite will spin the planet every 90 minutes. The mission will last 6 months. It will collect, send, and receive data.

Right now the goal is to learn how the process works and establish a framework of cooperation with the government because they need to go through certain approval processes, etc. They want to create an ecosystem to allow other startups to flourish.

This particular satellite won't have a camera but the future ones could. The developers asked the minister to fix the unreliable power grid in Yerevan because frequent power outages could hinder their work. *[will this shit finally convince the government to upgrade the grid?]* In any case, the company said they will soon install uninterruptible power supply devices.

The company will also build its own ""clean room"" with ISO standards. They are currently renting it from the Physics Institute. 

The minister said as part of the new space strategy they could increase funding and launch joint projects with private firms.

Construction company RenShen presented the $212 million project to the government for approval. It's expected to create 10,000 jobs. There will be 4 and 5 star hotels as well.

**PASHINYAN:** It will be in place of the HayPost [post office] building on 22 Saryan St. Modern construction standards will be introduced in Armenia. Since our independence, there has never been a complex of this scale. It will help Armenia raise the *""we are open for business""* flag. //

##... who is the developer?

**VAHAN KEROBYAN:** The World Trade Services Association was founded in New York in 1969. It's an active international business community that allows local businesses to find international investors and partners. Armenia-based Renshen became a member of the Association in 2021. 

There are 310 similar World Trade Centers around the world. These buildings quickly become the ""go-to place"" of the city. The buildings will take 123,000 m^2. 

**MHER GRIGORYAN:** Armenia is the only country in the region without a World Trade Center. Being the last means we can have the best quality and technology. 

##... who will build the complex?

Armenia-based Renshen has invited the international architectural giant ""Norman Foster"" who has developed the Apple Park in California, Germany's Reichstag Building, New York's skyscraper Hearst Tower, the City Hall of Southwark (London), Millennium Bridge in London, Bilbao Metro, and many more.  
 
##... who will own the complex?

50% investors, 30% HayPost, 20% Government. 

The company will buy HayPost's shares within the next 5 years. The revenue will help develop HayPost. It will have a new modern sorting facility to handle more parcels.

##Pashinyan visited Syunik's Shurnukh border village yesterday

It was an unannounced visit, presumably to prevent activists from closing the road like last time. He visited several houses and met residents before traveling through the village.

##Pashinyan visits Meghri / bodyguard and car attacked by activists

Today he continued the Syunik trip by visiting Meghri. While meeting the locals, a group of 40-50 protesters arrived and expressed displeasure with his visit and began chanting ""traitor leave"". One of them jumped on Pashinyan's [vehicle](https://i.imgur.com/6CiFql5.jpg). The bodyguard was attacked and had his [clothes ripped](https://youtu.be/fGzOVGh3Ht4). Threats were made.

One of the organizers was [identified](https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/211905) as Mkhitar Zakaryan, Meghri's former HHK mayor, who was [recently charged with embezzlement and is facing 2-6 years in prison](https://www.azatutyun.am/a/31111605.html).

His brother Mher Zakaryan was also reportedly in the group. He brought the local ""ML Hotel"" workers to the protest, including a waitress named Armine, who gave interviews to outlets about Pashinyan being a traitor.

One of the protesters was against giving Azerbaijan a [railway access](https://youtu.be/VsH78VKsmHA) in Syunik in exchange for Armenia receiving railway access to Iran through Nakhijevan.

After the attack, Pashinyan apologized to the rest of the gathered residents ""for the scene"", and said it will be investigated. Prosecutors asked the local police to investigate the attack; a felony case was launched over ""hooliganism and attack on state official"". No arrests were made as of the afternoon.   

Premier's spokeswoman later said, ""the incident was organized by circles familiar to you and have nothing to do with the people of Agarak and Meghri.""

##Pashinyan continued the Syunik trip in Kapan

He met a group of residents ""without provocateurs"".

Video: 
https://www.facebook.com/100003511952042/videos/3682602775200085/

He paid a visit to a local military station and ""thanked the soldiers for their service.""

https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/211923


##Pashinyan concludes the trip with a meeting with local officials

... during which he criticized Ilham Aliyev's recent ""contradictory"" and militaristic rhetoric about the ""Zangezur corridor"", saying there should be a response to it. 

**Pashinyan:** Our MFA responded yesterday. It is a provocation that needs to be countered on various platforms. As I've said again, there is no word of any 'corridor' in the November 9 statement. It's about unblocking regional communications. January 11's Moscow meeting clarified what exactly should happen with the regional communication routes. 

If Azerbaijan talks about Zangezur Corridor, then we can talk about Nakhijevan Corridor and North-Azerbaijan Corridor. Azerbaijan can only receive a 'corridor' similar to the one that Armenia can receive.

My assessment is that the Azerbaijani government wants to intentionally suspend the [trade unblocking] process with these provocative messages and to keep the blockade on Armenia.

##Pashinyan reads Serj's 2010 law that defines Syunik borders 

*Context: the former regime passed a law in 2010 that defined Syunik's borders. They claim it was only about internal borders and should not have been used by Pashinyan today to clarify the new Armenia-Azerbaijan borders. Pashinyan, in turn, insisted that the law also defined international borders. Today he cited the 2010 bill.*

**Pashinyan:** Regarding Syunik borders. A decision was made to bring the border line in line with the CSTO military bloc's definition of the international border so we could install Russian troops. The Armenian-Russian military-political alliance only applies to Armenian state borders. 

These borders were defined by Armenia, as I've said before. The law passed in 2010 defined the Syunik administrative borders. It directly describes where Shurnukh village is.

Let me read part of the 2010 law: *""The description of RA Syunik province's Shunukh village administrative borders. Shurnukh is located in the province's eastern part. In north's A-B section it borders the state borders (Republic of Azerbaijan).""* [the emphasis is the Republic of Azerbaijan]

The next paragraph, *""Shurnukh state borders (Republic of Azerbaijan), borderline A-B. In A-B section the border is the state border between the Republic of Armenia and Republic of Azerbaijan.""*

Next paragraph of the law, about Syunik's Vorotan village, *""In B-G section the border is the state border between Republic of Armenia and Republic of Azerbaijan.""* 

This is very important to emphasize because, in 2010, Armenia passed a law to describe its own territories. This is where the CSTO military law applies. 

Please note that the law does not mention that this border matches the border between Armenia and Artakh, it says Armenia and Azerbaijan. This is what lead to today's status quo in Syunik.


Large-scale army reforms have already begun in cooperation with Russia. We must have a strong army that can be a worthy ally and be capable of protecting the borders. No one can stop us on this journey. Armenia also has obligations as part of the alliance.

We are launching housing construction in Shurnukh. Since our independence, no new houses had been built in Shurnukh and Tavush's Chinari. 

We will also discuss mining industry reforms to ensure that Armenian citizens can feel that part of that national wealth goes to them.

##Azerbaijani MFA ""backtracks"" on land claims against Armenia

Every now and then, after sniffing a bad batch, the shipman makes territorial claims against Armenia's southern region, regarding a ""century-old dream"" of connecting Azerbaijan to Turkey via Zangezur.

Armenian MFA criticized Aliyev for one such remark. Azeri MFA responded saying Aliyev did not threaten the territorial integrity of Armenia, but rather it was ""a response in the event Armenia threatens Azerbaijan's territorial integrity."" 

Aliyev's concern is Armenia strengthening its army ""to the point it can become a threat."" He said he won't let that happen.

##Turkey-Russia-United States-Ukraine-Armenia kerfuffle

Turkey plans to sell drones to Ukraine. The president of Ukraine recently visited Turkey for discussions about eastern Ukraine. 

In turn, Russia sanctioned Turkey by severely restricting the flow of Russian tourists to the country.

Turkish MFA responded saying the sale of drones to Ukraine ""is not directed against Russia."" He offered Russia to also purchase the drones. ""We have good relations with both and we continue the purchase of Russian S-400 missile systems.""

The U.S. criticized Turkey for the purchase of Russian S-400 missiles. There are concerns that their installation, which would also mean the placement of Russian agents in the area, could be used to monitor American F-35 jets to find their weak spots in stealth technology. The U.S. suspended the sale of jets to Turkey a year ago.

Turkey pushed back on U.S. criticism over the purchase of Russian weapons, saying ""Turkey will make independent decisions.""

Joe Biden is expected to make an announcement on April 24th, regarding the Armenian Genocide. Turkish MFA said the recognition of the Genocide would further damage the TR-US relations.

It also goes into a good deal of detail into the 2001 document in Key West which Heydar agreed to there, but refused after returning home. An amount of detail I had never seen, and which I am fairly confident Tatul has access to knowing about.

So I'm curious what you guys think of that peace deal. It would have recognized Nagorno-Karabakh, and a narrow Lachin corridor, as well as an 8m wide strip of land along the Arax/Aras river for Azerbaijan to freely use in southern Armenia - with Armenian connections across it. Azeris would also move back to Shushi, and there would be an Azeri corridor from Shushi to Fizuli.

Do you think in retrospect that the past 20 years of massive military spending, closed borders, thousands of Azeri deaths, the Aliyev power being given this distraction, Russian troops in Azerbaijan, and whatever else has happened was worth it? Or would you rather Azerbaijan had just taken the deal back then? I'm just curious, that's all.

Here's what Tatul wrote about the deal in more detail:

> The corridor mechanism for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was documented in Key West in 2001. According to the proposals for the exchange of territories, which were acceptable to the Armenian parties, and Azerbaijan withdrew from the agreements at the last moment, three corridors were envisaged:

> 1. Lachin corridor, through which NKAO was connected to the Republic of Armenia, and it, in fact, became an Armenian territory, as by document NKAO became a sovereign part of Armenia.

> 2. Meghri corridor. The corridor to be given to Azerbaijan along the Araks coast, which would be about 40 kilometers long and 8 meters wide, would not become the property of Azerbaijan. However, at the same time, Azerbaijan would not pay any transit tax to Armenia to use the corridor freely.

> Initially, the option of connecting Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan with a 40-kilometer overpass, overpassing elevated road, was discussed, but it was too expensive. An 8-meter-wide road along the Araks coast was proposed, which would become an overpass when meeting settlements in the Meghri region and then descend to the ground again. This minimized the possibility of contact between the Azeris and the Armenians of Meghri from Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan and back.

> The construction of overpasses near the Armenian settlements, that is, the sovereign passage from the ground to the air, solved another problem - the land connection between Armenia and Iran. It is true that, by and large, the territory of Armenia was narrowing by 8 meters, and besides, Armenia was losing the opportunity to use the entire 40-kilometer-long Araks River, but on the other hand, Armenia could have more than one bridge over the overpasses connecting Armenia and Iran. as it is done today on a single bridge in the Norduz-Karchevan section, built in 1995.

> 3. From Fizuli to Shushi corridor. The issue of refugees and displaced persons has always been on the negotiating table, especially in the Key West version, and the focus was on the possibility of the return of Azeri refugees to Shushi. The Armenian side did not object in principle. However, the topic of serious discussion was not only their security, but also the question of how the Azeris of Shushi will connect with Azerbaijan. Here, too, the idea of ​​a corridor came to the rescue, which is to create an opportunity for Azeris to have free communication with Azerbaijan. That corridor or road could be from Fizuli to Shushi (after the 44-day war, Azerbaijan is building this road), from Aghdam to Shushi or from Shushi to Lachin, then a turn along the Hakkari coast to the Ghubatlu and Araks valleys."

2/12/2023,What do you believe about the Armenian genocide?,"What is your belief about the truth and nature of the alleged Armenian genocide which occurred from 1915 to 1920 or so?

I am an American and I’m surprised I have never learned about it in school. Apparently the Armenian community was one of the wealthiest and most influential in the Ottoman Empire. Either because they believed the Armenians would side with Russia during the war, or they just wanted them gone, the Young Turk junta killed more than a million Armenians: by shooting, death marches, drowning and poisoning accompanied by rape, pillage and other crimes. It was almost he genghis  khan level of brutality. 

To this day Turkey denies the crimes, even though there’s ample evidence for them.. especially the absent Armenians.

For what it’s worth I don’t think Islam caused or even had anything to do with the crimes. For the record, all the Young Turk leadership had been educated in Europe, pushed for European ideas, and was hostile toward traditional Islamic mores in Turkey.

7/17/2019,Armenian Genocide Denial from... The Huffington Post?!,"Allow me to introduce to you the target of today’s writing. Bruce Fein is an American attorney, and has made a name for himself as a conservative political pundit. Fein was an associate deputy attorney general under the Reagan administration, and has had his writings published in The Washington Times, The Huffington Post, and Slate.com, among others. Thinktanks he has worked for include the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the Turkish Coalition of America.


He’s also one of America’s most prominent deniers of the Armenian Genocide, never bothering to hide this rather repugnant behavior. Major publications in the United States have run his inane tracts on the subject in op-ed sections in rather shocking indifference to the insult these pseudohistorical rants have for the memory of Armenian Genocide victims. But come on, it can’t be that bad? These are pretty respected news websites; would they really publish genocide denial articles in the 21st century? Well, let’s take a gander to exactly what Mr. Fein says...



“Armenian crimes against humanity and war crimes against the Ottoman Turkish and Kurdish populations of eastern and southern Anatolia during World War I and its aftermath have been forgotten amidst congressional preoccupation with placating the vocal and richly financed Armenian lobby.”



Oh boy, we start off with a classic method of genocide denial: claiming that the targeted groups where “the real violent ones” who laid bloodshed to the land in mindless rebellion and hostility. This is a red herring. If we were to allow Fein to write the history books, you’d think that the Ottoman Empire was a peaceful state who were only defending themselves against bloodthirsty hoards, ignoring that the Ottomans where the perpetrators of some of the worst war crimes of WW1.



“Justin McCarthy of the University of Louisville concluded that a staggering 2.5 million Anatolian Muslims died in World War I and the Turkish War of Independence.”



Yes, many Ottomans died in the first War World. It’s tragic and perhaps deserves more Western attention, but you’re using the death of those Turks to shield away from the very subject that you yourself brought up. There’s a reason that those deaths are rarely ever directly compared to the Armenian Genocide, as the context between the two are night and day. Not to mention that Justin McCarthy himself is an Armenian Genocide denier, and therefore not a reasonable person to quote in such an article.



“In parts of Europe, disbelief in the Armenian genocide allegation is a crime on par with Holocaust denial. But the Holocaust was proven before the Nuremburg Tribunal with the trappings of due process. Armenians, in contrast, have forgone bringing their genocide allegation before the International Court of Justice because it is unsupported by historical facts.”



Seeing as how there was no tribunal into the American Indian Genocide, I guess that was an okay thing, no? And there was a movement to bring Ottoman war criminals to trial by the Paris Peace Conference, which brought up targeted crimes against the Armenian people in their drafts. These court hearings did not go through as a result of political pressure.



 “To paraphrase Mark Twain, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and the number of Armenians who are claimed by Armenians and their echo chambers to have died in an alleged World War I genocide.”



I’m sure Twain wouldn’t appreciate his unexpected and unreasoned appearance here. Moving on…



“But the best contemporary estimates by Armenians or their sympathizers were 300,000-750,000…”



Contemporary estimates where actually higher than that. The New York Times stated in October 1915 that a million Armenians had died. Le Petite Parisien gave 1.5 million deaths in 1919. The Sydney Morning Herald reported a million dead in a 1921 article. Fein is choosing to ignore and cherry-pick data from newspaper archives to suggest that recent death toll estimates are a new invention.



“Further, not a single one of those deaths necessarily falls within the definition of genocide in the authoritative Genocide Convention of 1948.  It requires proof that the accused was responsible for the physical destruction of a group in whole or in substantial part specifically because of their race, nationality, religion, or ethnicity.  A political or military motivation for a death falls outside the definition.”



There’s a glut of evidence that they were targeted because of their ethnicity, with the deliberate aim of extermination. Fein’s quote also ignores that political and military motivations can and do overlap with ethnic discrimination, as has been shown countless times throughout history.



“To make their case more convincing, Armenians hiked the number of deaths.  They also altered their story line from having died as belligerents against the Turks to having perished like unarmed helpless lambs.”



Most Armenians who died where not belligerents against the Turks, countless civilians and refugees were sent to extermination centers such as the Deir ez-Zor camps and the Ras al-Ayn Camps. There are also testimonies of other horrors including forced labor, rapes, sexual mutilation, death marches, mass burnings, women and children being drowned at sea, and even lethal human experimentation. It’s not okay to do those things to anyone, even to alleged belligerents.


These graphic crimes are, of course, not mentioned once in either of Fein’s articles. To him all the Armenians were bad news, their stories of suffering and hardship not worthy to be recalled or properly preserved. To him these are events that deserve to obscured and forgotten by mankind. However, we must ask ourselves what we lose if we willingly allow history to leave our collective memories, when we let a most dark and tragic side of humanity get whitewashed? If we let ourselves get distracted with falsehoods to the extent that they become “reality”, then what is we really see with our waking eyes other than a pathetic illusion?


Masochists can enjoy themselves by reading Fein’s articles here:

That being said, to answer your request, the Armenian Genocide in Fortnite terms could be described as a forced exile of a group of players from their homeland by another group, with the use of tactics such as spawn camping, griefing, and targeted attacks. The Armenian players were outnumbered and outgunned, and many were unable to defend themselves against the more powerful and organized opposing group. The Armenian players were subjected to atrocities such as mass killings, loot stealing, and destruction of their bases and structures. The events that took place during the Armenian Genocide in real life were much more tragic and complex than this simplified video game scenario, and it's important to remember and honor the victims and survivors of such atrocities with sensitivity and respect."

No matter how many documents you present and how many proofs you give, the Turks will reject the genocide just for this reason.

Since 1991, the Ukrainian state has badly mismanaged the country. The majority of industries were shut down and sold for scrap metal by unscrupulous oligarchs, including the financier of the fascist battalions like Azov, Aidar, etc (Igor Kolomoysky).

This state has done nothing but loot the treasury and make life worse for the people. Why should any Ukrainian risk their lives for such a state?

The average wage in Russia is 4x greater than the average wage in Ukraine. Russia annexing Ukraine would objectively make life far better for most Ukrainians.

Not only is Ukraine extremely corrupt, it also has a massive neo-Nazi problem. These far-right groups commit crimes against civilians like tying them up to lampposts and assassinating anti-fascist journalists like Oles Buzina. Nobody is ever punished for these atrocities.

There's nothing more sickening to me than to see Westerners in this subreddit cheer on this war like it's some kind of football game, without any concern for the lives at stake. They treat us like combat units in some sick kind of strategy video game like Hearts of Iron, ramming the same units against entrenched lines again and again.

They're not the ones dying or risking their lives or having lifelong PTSD so it doesn't matter how many Ukrainians are killed for ""independence"" and ""territorial integrity"".

In fact, Ukrainians lived best when we were united with Russia as part of the USSR. Ukraine manufactured spaceship parts, advanced machinery, and was the breadbasket of the USSR. It was also the most economically developed and prosperous part of the USSR.

There was never any discrimination against Ukrainians in the Soviet Union. 2 General Secretaries of the USSR were from Ukraine - Khruschev and Brezhnev. Ukraine thrived until the late 80s when Gorbachev liberalized the food production system. 

What will we get as part of the EU? Nothing. Other countries that joined the EU are in desperate poverty today. See Bulgaria, Greece, etc. The EU serves the most powerful countries, i.e. Germany, which will flood the Ukrainian market with goods that will put the rest of Ukraine out of business.

Would the Azerbaijanis even go for it if it was done on a 1:1 basis? It seems like a decent compromise in that the Armenian part of Karabakh does not seem to contain any notable old Azeri settlements - I think they are less tied to it than they are to say Shushi, it solves the Armenian problem for them, and gets them something they aren’t going to otherwise get - a united country.

The benefit for Armenia is a historic Armenian land with a large Armenian population joins the country. Neither country gets a net gain or loss of land if it is 1:1.

##Freedom House condemns Azerbaijan's aggression, urges U.S. and democratic states to pressure Azerbaijan and protect Armenia's territorial integrity 

**F.H. President Abramowitz:** The Azerbaijani armed forces must immediately cease their deadly attacks on Armenian territory and commit to the ongoing peace process.

We welcome the commitment by French president Emmanuel Macron to hold discussions at the UN Security Council, and urge democratic governments to consider additional steps to protect Armenia’s territorial integrity. //

4) strike or significantly tighten the waiver provision of Section 907.

##Azeri opposition figure to Aliyev regime: if Armenians are ill-equipped and hungry as you say, how come we lost so many soldiers within just a few hours of fighting?

**Ali Kerimli:** Every Azeri wants to know. How come we lost so many soldiers while fighting against the ""hungry"" enemy for a few hours? What does it take for our army to lose fewer battles? 

They need modern and precise weapons, while professional soldiers should be retrained. They must be properly prepared. Do not spare ammunition during the exercises. 

There must be a plan; adventurous commanders should not be allowed to sacrifice soldiers. 

Since 50 of the 29 shaheeds are officers *[outdated data]*, that means the theory that we had sent unprepared soldiers cannot be true.

So how did our army, while fighting against a demoralized, ill-equipped, and poor enemy, sustain so many casualties within just a few hours? Can we assume we have 3-4 times as many wounded? So many losses, yet nothing was gained. The authorities cannot ignore these issues by being silent. We expect an explanation from Aliyev. //

##Armenian opposition figure: in some directions, our soldiers were not brought to combat readiness prior to the attack 

**Reporter:** Do you see any frontline improvement since last year? Last year, after the deployment in new areas, in many locations we had no soldiers yet. Shepherds would occasionally encounter an enemy on the border. 

**PU MP Tigran Abrahamyan:** Yes, certain problems have been addressed in several directions. Our soldiers displayed heroism in multiple directions. The problem is that several bases were not brought to combat state prior to the attack. These soldiers were not deployed to the frontlines despite information about a possible attack. Some of the soldiers were asleep. It doesn't matter now if it was due to poor intel or poor command. If you see enemy accumulations, you should be ready. Even if the army leadership doesn't send an order, local commanders have the authority to bring them to combat readiness. 

**Reporter:** We had a similar problem in April 2016, about the troops not being fully ready. At the time, the explanation was that although it was known that the enemy could attack at any moment, it was dragged for so long that the forces let their guard down. If that ""any moment"" starts to look ""permanent"", can you keep your forces in special regimes for so long? 

**Abrahamyan:** In vulnerable times, various regimes can be used. In 2016 the intel told us that diversionary activities are possible in various directions. The command took steps in those directions. It's another thing that the intel failed to uncover the true scale of the planned ""diversionary activities"".

##Azerbaijan has not captured any settlements, the battles were near positions: Parliament Speaker 

**Reporter:** Yesterday Pashinyan announced that Azerbaijan invaded 10 km^2 during the aggression, in addition to the ~40 km^2 they had invaded last year. Does this include settlements?

**Speaker Simonyan:** The territories do not include any settlements. The main battles were near the positions. There were positional changes. Our soldiers were able to recapture some of the lost positions, while in other places Azeri managed to succeed. //

##... battles and territorial changes 

Azeri forces invaded a territory near the border village Nerkin Hand. Since the enemy is too close to the village, women and children had to be evacuated. Male residents remain in the village, armed with rifles. 

---

**Reporter:** What's the status in Ishkhanasar direction? The media reported that some positions were lost. Were we able to recover any?

**Goris mayor:** Yes, there were some losses, there were some gains, a few meters back and forth. The most important thing is to fight and stand for our territorial integrity. We need to strike preemptively. //

---

**Ex-Premier Aram Sargsyan:** Had Armenia possessed modern weapons, the battles would have been in the territory of Azerbaijan by now. Our soldiers displayed heroism. After Azeri groups attempted to infiltrate the border - you've seen [one of the videos](https://youtu.be/RCypI9xQ8DQ?t=4) - our forces took measures to stop them. Azeris then used artillery. Armenia responded with artillery fire as well; they've done an excellent job with it, ask anyone who was present on the border. Azeris, after realizing they weren't succeeding, began using GRAD missiles. We responded with GRAD fire, damaging an Azeri military base. Seeing they are unable to win in an equal fight, they ramped up the use of drones and other modern weapons.

Pashinyan [revealed on Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/xdigh2/sep132022_military_aggression_by_azerbaijan/) that after becoming Premier, the military gave him a list of weapons worth $12 billion, to which he agreed. After the 2020 war, I encouraged them to acquire 120 drones worth $100 million from India. On Tuesday Pashinyan revealed why that wasn't possible. He brought up 4 reasons, with which agree, but he didn't reveal the 5th and most important reason. There are countries that are willing to sell us modern weapons and anti-drone weapons. Even the U.S., during the 2020 war, had agreed to sell us radiolocation stations. But Russia, whom Pashinyan mentioned under reason-2 without giving its name, had threatened Armenia that if it buys weapons from the U.S., they won't deliver artillery shells to Armenia. There are also weapons that the West won't sell to us unless we leave CSTO. //

**France's UN Security Council rep.:** France is concerned over the actions taking place on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border. Several areas in the territory of Armenia have been fired at, civilian infrastructures were damaged. This is the heaviest fighting since 2020. 

France, together with its partners, is trying to encourage respect for the ceasefire. President Macron spoke with Prime Minister Pashinyan and President Aliyev. The terms of the 2020 November trilateral statement must be maintained. 

We are calling on Azerbaijan to pull back troops to initial positions, the territorial integrity of Armenia must be preserved. The parties must discuss demarcation and delimitation issues and prevention of violence. //

Pelosi will be accompanied by Representative Jackie Speier. She is expected to meet Pashinyan and other government officials. 

>It will be the speaker’s latest dramatic foreign trip following her contentious arrival in Taiwan last month.

##Iran will apply ""special resistance"" if Azerbaijan attempts to endanger the Iran-Armenian state border 

**Iran's embassy to Armenia:** As we saw in the news reports covering the meetings between [the leaders of Iran, Turkey, and Russia], Iran opposes the violation of territorial integrity and borders of neighboring countries and will display special resistance to any scenario which would endanger the Iran-Armenia border.

This principled position was repeated during the recent phone calls with the representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan. //

##there is no document whatsoever about surrendering Nagorno Karabakh: president of Nagorno Karabakh Harutyunyan to concerned residents 

Context in [Tuesday news](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/xebtjo/sep142022_western_officials_call_for_sanctions/). Pashinyan accused Armenia-based opposition of intentionally distorting his words to claim he will soon sign an unfavorable document to surrender Nagorno Karabakh or give Azerbaijan a ""corridor"". Karabakh administration contacted Pashinyan to clarify it was a misunderstanding. They sent a delegation to Yerevan today.

**Nagorno Karabakh President Harutyunyan:** The leadership of Armenia keeps me informed in detail about all the international discussions on the Artsakh [Nagorno Karabakh] issue. Joint consultations are held regularly. We have an agreement that any document would need to take into account the Artsakh authorities' opinion. Under this context, there is not even a process to draft such a document. //

---

**Ioannesian, Informed Citizens NGO:** During last night's opposition protest in front of parliament, Pashinyan invited me and several other public figures and analysts for a meeting. We held a constructive and honest discussion on various topics. 

I'd like to emphasize that there was no mention of signing any ""document"" or anything. Pashinyan could have formulated his words better in parliament, but certain media outlets took them out of context and exaggerated it. We all know what happened next. 

[Conspiracy theorist blogger Vardan Ghukasyan] made up a claim and helped spread it. It's truly sad that our society's media literacy is so low that [Vardan Ghokasyan] is the news source. //

---

Armenia-based opposition parties continued to accuse Pashinyan of ""treason"" on Thursday. They held a protest yesterday, during which there were attempts to take down the gates in front of the parliament building.

**Ruling MP Papoyan:** The false claims [about a ""document""] circulated after Pashinyan's Wednesday speech was a media terror and needs a legal evaluation. Only an enemy collaborator can do such a thing. It was clearly meant to weaken our soldiers' morale. We have been informed that certain people contacted provincial settlements yesterday and told them that a treacherous document is going to be signed within the next 5 minutes, *""come to Yerevan, fight here""*. This was an attempt to open the second front against Armenia, at a time when our soldiers were fighting well, and fulfilling their duties. I believe our public needs better media literacy so it can repel the manipulations. //

**Oppo MP Gegham Manukyan:** People who gathered in front of the parliament building yesterday were not sent there by us. Thousands of people are concerned about their country. They forced Pashinyan to clarify his words about signing a document, and yet they still haven't denied it fully. //

**Ruling MP Vahagn Alexanyan:** Here is the timeline of events yesterday. Our soldiers were able to score a series of successes on the battlefield - modest successes but nevertheless successes. This was followed by Pashinyan declaring in Parliament that Armenia will not give a Syunik corridor to Azerbaijan. The opposition, which is being controlled and financed by centers located outside of Armenia, proceeded to launch a disinformation terror campaign to open a second front against our soldiers. They cut a minute-long clip from Pashinyan's speech and presented it out of context to claim ""a document is about to be signed"". They hired a few actors to upload videos in which they cry, but when you look at them closely, there is not a single drop of tear, because even here the opposition embezzled the funds that were meant to hire decent actors. Glory to our soldiers for standing strong. //

Things eventually got heated in parliament. A confrontation erupted between the ruling and opposition parties. The opposition said it will proceed with an impeachment process that they have been planning for several weeks. The ruling party MP said the impeachment will fail because the ruling MPs won't vote in favor.

A ruling party MP suggested for the opposition to send its supporters to defend the borders instead of carrying out a ""coup"", and urged for the gathered able-bodied men to be drafted immediately. The opposition criticized the MP. When asked to comment, the authorities denied any plans to draft the protesters.

##U.S. is rotating its diplomats between Ukraine, Armenia, and Russia  

U.S. ambassador Lynne Tracy will end her duties in Armenia, as announced in June. She is headed to Russia.

Kristina Kvien, the ~~deputy ambassador~~ chargé d'affaires to Ukraine, will be the new ambassador to Armenia.

Tracy speaks Russian. US officials point out that Russia *does* want to maintain diplomatic relations with the US and could be motivated to accept Tracy without delaying the process to ensure their ambassador in Washington maintains access.

##VIDEO: head of Russian ""Wagner"" mercenary group boasting about armament reserves while convincing prisoners to join the fight in Ukraine 

**Yevgeny Prigozhin to prisoners:** This war is difficult. The war in Chechnya doesn't even get close to this. We've used twice as many shells as what was used in Stalingrad. 

Do not retreat. Anyone who retreats will be shot. Those who move forward tend to survive. Those who retreat and display timidity end up in a mess.

Do not surrender. During the training, you will be taught about the two grenades that you will carry on you. 

Do not consume substances. 

Do not loot and rape.

You must be between the ages of 22-50. If you're older but in a good shape, we will check your strength. Being in good physical shape is extremely important. 

The first group of recruited prisoners, from St. Petersbourg, fought with us in June in the Ugledarsk power plant. Of the 40 people who entered enemy trenches, 3 died and 7 were wounded heroically. 

We will administer a polygraph test and ask questions to understand how reliable you are. I will speak with you for a few minutes, then you will be questioned for 2-3 years by others. 

We only need shock troops. You will be treated as equals, or sometimes even better than those who've been fighting with us for years. 

We have fire support units that will secure our offense. We have various types of jets, MLRS, tanks, and everything necessary to advance effectively.   

After fighting for 6 months, you will receive an amnesty and go home. Those who decide to stay with us, can stay. There is no option to return to prison. If you join and change your mind, you will be dubbed as a ""deserter"" and executed. 

If you die fighting, you will be buried in the place stated in your will. You will be buried in the alley of heroes in your city. If nothing is specified, you will be buried near the Wagner chapel in Goryachi Kluch. //

##Armenia has a new Prosecutor General 

Arthur Davtyan's term has ended. He has been replaced by Anna Vardapetyan, who took oath during the Parliament session today. 

Davtyan made several controversial proposals weeks prior to his scheduled departure. He suggested *(and received a rejection from the ruling party)* legalizing capital punishment for treason-related crimes, and called for tougher social media oversight to combat the online sale of narcotics and other crimes.

##Constitutional Court has two new judges; update on ""March 1st""  

As [reported earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/vogg80/jun302022_news_artsakh_will_build_a_large_hydro/), Serj-era judge Arevik Petrosyan's term will end in December. It's the Government's turn to nominate a judge.

The Government has nominated a prominent pro-Western lawyer Seda Safaryan. She became publically famous after representing ""March 1st"" victims against the Kocharyan regime. Safaryan joined the pro-Western Babajanyan-Shirinyan alliance to run against Pashinyan's QP party during the 2021 parliamentary elections.

**MP:** Can you update us on the March 1 situation? The charges were dropped from [Kocharyan & co] because they were charged under an article that was written ""poorly"", as others have claimed.

**Candidate Seda Safaryan:** It wasn't necessarily about the article being weak. It was also because certain charges were not pressed. I don't know why the prosecutor decided to press only ""toppling the constitution"" charges. But Armenia has a new Prosecutor General today, so the March 1st approach could change. The March 1st case is not closed. There is a pending case in the Cassations Court. Another case is being investigated by the Investigative Committee separately. //

Serj-era judge Ashot Khachatryan's term is also ending. It was the President's turn to nominate a judge. He nominated Hovakim Hovakimyan. 

The Parliament voted to approve both judges. Two reporters from Kocharyan-affiliated media outlets were escorted out of Parliament building for ""disrupting the voting process"", after they got into a verbal argument with MPs during the secret-ballot voting process. One of the MPs, overseeing the voting process, had to suspend her activities and leave the room. The Parliament speaker Alen Simonyan criticized the reporters for the disruption and asked the security agents to escort the reporters out. Not long ago the Parliament approved new rules of conduct, allowing security services to remove reporters who break ethics rules or disrupt activities.

9/28/2023,Stop Demonizing the West without good reason,"As the title suggests. Goddamn it people. This sub can be unusually bipolar at times and it takes away from the content of the posts here.

First of all the West (US and EU) has no 'innate' obligations towards Armenia. It's not part of a military alliance with Armenia. It's not part of an economic alliance with Armenia. Stop expecting them to be superman, God or Gandalf. There are a lot of atrocities out there in the world that we do jack shit to alleviate or stop. Same with the West. You can't save everyone. And despite this the West sees value in Armenia and now has vested interest and seeks a stake. 

That being said: 

How many times do Armenians have to be told that we and only we through hard work, taking responsibility and getting serious, and rational intelligent thinking, planning and project execution can save ourselves. There is no more crying or relying on outside partners. No more. Please use mindfulness or impromptu cognitive therapy to find that impulse or behavior within you and extinguish it. No more. 

Secondly. Do you think it was Russia that stopped the Azeris in 21' and 22' from attacking (and conquering) Southern Armenia for their bloody corridor? NO, it was the diplomatic pressure from the West and the red lines of iran. From the sending of Pelosi, the decision to send the Kansas national guard in September when the chance of war is highest, and the West's repeat behind closed doors warnings that Azerbaijan not pursue a military option in NK, while standing by Armenia's territorial integrity. See the French decision to create a syunik consulate. You can't look at this and say the West doesn't care. No, the West has interests here.

Unfortunately for us, Ru gave Az the green light in NK. The US cannot militarily enter a region with russian armed forces, but it is trying its best to pressure azerbaijan into accepting international observers. 

Not all of us here live in Armenia. Some of us live in Western countries. Europe. UK. The United States. Even Australia or New Zealand. The goals of these diasporas are to see to that western and armenian interests align and to facilitate this process. 

Demonizing the West isn't helping. Equating the West with Russia isn't helping. Moreover, the West is helping because of its interests. Each nation has perceived (and real) interests that they pursue. We should all get with the program. Nations usually, though not always, act in what they calculate to be their best interests, which are not always Armenia's interests. 

That's just the way it is. But we make due with what we can."
7/24/2023,The Treaty of Lausanne: Empowering Turkiye's Territorial Integrity,"Welcome to **TIME PRINTER** where we explore the remarkable events of **TIME**.

Today we will highlight one of the most discussed and criticized International Agreements in the ongoing world, the **Treaty of Lausanne**. 

With any international agreement in the world, it lasts only for 100 years. By **2023**, **Turkiye** will be free from the tie of this agreement, and it will positively impact on the overall development of **Turkiye**.

The Treaty of Lausanne was signed on July 24, 1923. This international treaty recognized the boundaries of the newly established modern state of **Turkiye**.

After **Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's** armies defeated the **Greek** invaders and drove them out of **Anatolia**, a treaty was signed at **Mudanya** on October 11, 1922. 

When **the British** saw their allies defeated and realized that the **Italians** and **French** were also not willing to oppose **Turkey's** liberation movement, they ended their occupation of **Istanbul** and **the Straits**. 

As a result, **Turkish** troops entered Istanbul on October 19, 1922. This Turkish victory led to the downfall of the **Lloyd George** government and the calling of the peace treaty by **Britain**. 

**Ismet Inonu**, the leader of the victorious Turkish national forces, led the Turkish delegation at the peace talks in **Lausanne**. The countries represented at the talks were **Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Greece, Romania,** and **Serbo-Croatia**. Later, **Russia, Belgium**, and **Portugal** joined the negotiations to discuss the Turkish straits and financial matters related to the former **Ottoman Empire**. **The United States** attended the talks as an observer.

The negotiations began on November 21, 1922 and lasted over eight months. Turkey wanted its borders, Turkish straits, and capitulations recognized. Borders were accepted with special conditions for **Iskenderun** and **Mosul**. Iskenderun joined Turkey in 1939, but Mosul became part of **Iraq**. 

Turkey gained control of the straits with rules for international traffic and **Black Sea** countries, agreed in the **Montreux Treaty** on July 20, 1936. The Turkish War of National Liberation was fought by a devastated nation against the most powerful imperial states of the time, Britain and France, and their allies Italy and Greece. 

This victory became a source of inspiration for many other nations in their struggle against Western imperialism and independence for years to come.

10/9/2023,"[opinion] The current Palestinian-Israeli conflict is bad for Armenian geopolitics, even worse if Iran gets actively involved.","As we know, recently the US and Iran were taking very small steps in repairing damages, this is obvious on getting back on the nuclear talks and US releasing Iranian money in exchange for prisoners I believe, I remember Israel strongly criticizing these a few times, fast forward to the Hamas attacks on Israel, Israel, as you'd guess, is back at lobbying with the ""see? I told you so"" rhetoric on US, and US seems to be taking the bait. What does this mean for us? well, even without Iranian involvement Israel is going to try hard to get the US back at complete Iran annihilation page, and if Iran decides it wants to support Palestinians by getting involved now, it would pretty much guarantee the escalation of US-Israeli and Iranian relations to absolute ""destroy them at any cost"" levels, and if that happens, which I predict it will, given Israel in the context, Azerbaijan is going to be viewed as the main ally and main proxy against Iran, in many ways this leverage will guaranteed unwavering support to Azerbaijan, against Iran, at a direct cost of Armenia and/or Armenian interests, I worry that they would even give up protecting Armenia's territorial integrity given it assures the destruction of Iran, as long as they are hurting Iran in the many ways that they can, be it ethnic conflict internally or full on war with Azerbaijan and Turkey, maybe both.   


In my opinion, the best outcome for Armenia is for Iran to get a more sensible government that is not keen on being an arch nemesis of Israel, or vice versa with an Israeli government not keen on destroying Palestine, nevertheless a better, more democratic Iranian government   
would be a much better outcome.

9/20/2022,S.05 - Statement on the recent Azerbaijani hostilities in Armenia [DEBATE],"## Statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the recent Azerbaijani hostilities in Armenia

Madam Speaker, thank you for scheduling time for this statement.

Madam Speaker, I wish to update the House on recent news in Armenia.

On Monday, Azerbaijani troops opened fire on Armenian soldiers in border clashes, which Armenian sources which we have no reason to doubt claim has left 105 people dead, and which as yet show little sign of ceasing. This conflict is understood to be ethnically motivated, stemming from tensions around the Armenian-majority Nagorno-Karabakh region inside Azerbaijan, and the latest in a long pattern of hostilities since the Armenian Genocide over 100 years ago. The Turkish Government has signalled support for this act. This is not the first time hostilities like this have flared up, with the last conflict taking place only in 2020. If left unchecked, this conflict could lead to another full-scale war in the region, potentially backed by Turkey, especially given recent worrying statements President Erdoğan has made relating to Armenians. Such a conflict would be a disaster, and this is why I have decided to take action now.

It is clear to me that Azerbaijan is the clear aggressor in the present conflict, and as such today I have taken the decision to act under the powers in the Autonomous Sanctions Act 2021 to put sanctions on Azerbaijan, and to pave the way for further sanctions against businesses and individuals who seek to harm the territorial integrity of Armenia as a result of these recent conflicts.

This cannot continue. I will be supporting any efforts towards peace and reconciliation that Armenia and Azerbaijan make, and will use all the soft power resources I can to stop this from escalating into a full scale war.

Do you guys ever think Armenia and Turkey will come to terms with each other and be neutral? Is there a possibility we won’t be as hostile to each other? Of course we won’t fully forgive each other because of our histories, but is it possible? And also, do you wish relations between Armenia and Turkey were more peaceful? Of course there isn’t a solid answer because we can’t see the future, but we can theorize. I’m interested in your opinions"
10/9/2020,Some historic perspective on why there are so many hostilities between Azerbaijan and Armenia.,"The root of our (Azerbaijani and Armenian) national identities can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th century Ottoman empire. As the Ottoman empire was transitioning from a semi feudal empire to a nation state based imperial model, the rights of minorities all throughout the empire had deteriorated. Furthermore, this transformed the identity of the Ottoman empire from a predominantly Muslim force, to a state led by pan-turcik idealism. In these circumstances the national identity of Armenians was forged, in opposition to the dominant pan-turkic imperialism. Both of these political philosophies would make their way from Anatolia to caucasia influencing, both turkic and armenian populations there. Eventually the goal of the Armenians was to establish a state for the preservation of their peoples and culture, whilst the goal of the Azerbaijani people became the creation of a turkic state based on the young turk model (and possible further integration with the ottoman state). So in that respect both Nations stood as a roadblock for each other's national goals. This would colmenite in the first Armenian-Azerbaijani war, where armenians were defeated by the azerbaijanis with the help of turks. At the time, the only thing that Soviet Union did was to put a pause to the conflict, which flared up right after the dissolution of the USSR. This time due to the Kemalist doctrine of non-intervention Azerbaijan was left alone, while the Armenia could now enjoy the support of Russia which ended up winning the war for them. The overall reason why the conflict started up again is that Turkey is re-emerging from the isolationist policies of Ataturk and re-embracing it's past colonial legacy. The recent emergence of Turkey has shifted the power back to the side of Azerbaijan, which is why the war has started again."

5/26/2023,aliyev will gladly sign a peace agreement and then violate it in every possible way,"`Let's forget about the 120k Armenians in Artsakh who will be ethnically cleansed and focus on Armenia throughout this post.`

There are two kinds of people, let's start with the first and most naive one. They believe that ""aliyev will sign a peace agreement and peace there will be"". There are so many problems with this approach, that i don't know where to begin. First of all, there is an ethnic hatred, which has been cultivated for 30-40 years in azerbaijan, you think the majority of their people wants to live in a good faith with us? Think again. Secondly, there is turkey, which also wants it's share of concessions from Armenia, mostly the so-called ""Zangezur corridor"", and also dropping the Armenian Genocide issue. The most effective method of achieving these goals is through sheer force and the tool is azerbaijan. The third reason is Russia. Russia also wants the aforementioned corridor and wants to keep Armenia  in it's firm grips. Finally and most importantly **aliyev doesn't want peace, he will lose his power**. All his power is based around the hatred and hostilities towards Armenians and Armenia. The moment it stops, he has nothing to offer to his people. Expect the inner economical, social, political and ethnic problems to undermine his power. I don't think he would like that. How is he gonna boost his popularity among the population without ""killing eremenis and restoring historical azerbaijani lands""?

There is the second kind which thinks - ""hmm, okay, aliyev doesn't want peace, so it won't sign an agreement anyway, so why worry?"". Wrong. aliyev will sign an agreement that has beneficial clauses for him and will simply ignore the ones it doesn't like. It will become the second ""November 9th agreement"" where Armenia made everything it agreed to and more, while azeris refused to do number of things. So how do you like it now with that agreement? It will be like that, only this time it will touch Armenia to a greater extent.

The key takeaway is, there will be no peace anyway, no need to sign another capitulation right away."

After laying the ground work of starving Artsakh and claiming cease fire violations on the daily....I would look at the resignation of the Artsakh government as a great timing to overrun Artsakh militarily and claim it was to save the Azeri-Armenian population from themselves and stamp out the terrorists that continually  shoot at our troops....for once and for all.   Russia gave the greenlight to show Pashinyan who is boss still (Rome statute and recent comments by Pashinyan the final straw if one needed).   If I were the psychotic despot I may grab a few meters of Armenia proper as well...you know for the safety of my troops.   I would not do a full scale invasion of Armenia though.  Losing Artsakh will weaken Pashinyan (which my Russian partners want) where if I invade Armenia I risk strengthening him at home and internationally.  It would also cause unneeded complications internationally and with Iran next door and further Armenian support abroad.   The international community I am betting will call my blitz of Artsakh a fait accompli and broadly demand that Azerbaijan not violate their Azeri-Armenian citizens human rights...and then gladly wash their hands of the whole distraction.   I have my lands back, I can solve my Armenian problem at my leisure, I have my revenge and I have put a stake in the heart of Pashinyan for my Russian comrades."

The two neighboring states had formal governmental relations between 1918 and 1921, during their brief independence from the collapsed Russian Empire, as the First Republic of Armenia and the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan; these relations existed from the period after the Russian Revolution until they were occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union, becoming the constituent republics of Soviet Armenia and Soviet Azerbaijan. The two wars waged by the countries in the past century—one from 1918 to 1921 and another from 1988 to 1994—have strained relations. In the wake of ongoing hostilities, the social memory of Soviet-era cohabitation is widely repressed (censored and stigmatized).

Number 1 the constant hostility and young soldiers dying everyday on the border is over.
Number 2 we no longer have to be tied down to Russia. 

Russia will always try to create a very confusing conflict for Armenia in order to keep Armenia on a leash. They probably knew this day would come and they are already in the process of taking the next step to ensure Armenia remains under russian control. So it probably good to no creat any long term deals.

Zangezur corridor will probably be offered with some very good incentive but Armenians of the future like our grand children or great grandchildren will face a similar conflict because of it which will lead to loss of more land. If Armenia wants to thrive it needs to be friendly with everyone but not attached to anyone. 

In my opinion Armenia should become such a great nation future generations of world leaders including Turks are interested in maintaining good relationships with us."

4/3/2016,Azerbaijan Declares Unilateral Ceasefire after Hostilities with Armenia,
10/10/2023,Aliyev Didn't Anticipate This Outcome?,"Hey everyone, I just had this thought after reading some posts and diving into various treaties. I want to emphasize that this might seem a bit unconventional, and it's not an attempt to sugarcoat the negatives. 

I've been pondering whether Aliyev may have inadvertently undermined his own goals, particularly in the context of the 2023 war. It might sound a bit far-fetched, but hear me out.

Aliyev and his father had a longstanding vision of a united corridor to Nakhchivan. Numerous discussions revolved around the idea of the Lachine Corridor and Karabakh's sovereignty in exchange for the opportunity to establish a Zangezur corridor. When the 2020 war began, he agreed to halt hostilities (again, with an eye on the Zangezur corridor). Yet, he could have continued his pursuit back in 2020 to reclaim what he considered Azerbaijan's lands. Why stop?

Fast forward three years, and nothing materialized. Frustrated, he proceeds with the closure of the Lachine Corridor and cold nights, he eventually resorted to threatening Armenia by attacking Stepanakert (while, in the meantime, Russia aimed to punish Armenia for its Westernization).

Here's where things took an unexpected turn, in my opinion. When Artsakh decided to dissolve, they not only dissolved but also they all decided to leave. Aliyev couldn't act while they were fleeing without significant consequences. My hunch is that he wanted to keep those Armenians within his reach, forming a controlled type of Armenian diaspora, perhaps as potential bargaining chips for the future. However, now he seems to have lost that leverage over Armenia.

Regarding his pursuit of the Zangezur corridor, attacking Armenia at this point has significant legal repercussions. But his dream remains unfulfilled. Dictators, especially those like Aliyev, often have self-serving ambitions. He might try to sell the idea of the Zangezur corridor as beneficial for Azerbaijan or as a unifying move, but it's essential to remember that it often boils down to personal interests and, in his case, potentially his own pockets. Businessmen and politicians typically prioritize their own gains, and Aliyev seems to encompass all those roles and more.

As per the following statement on the last treaty:

""9. All economic and transport connections in the region shall be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia shall guarantee the security of transport connections between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to arrange unobstructed movement of persons, vehicles, and cargo in both directions. The Border Guard Service of the Russian Federal Security Service shall be responsible for overseeing the transport connections.""

It's worth noting that in this treaty, there's no explicit mention of a corridor. Instead, it emphasizes unblocking economic and transport connections, with Armenia guaranteeing security for these connections. This arrangement may indeed have more to do with ensuring his own interests than anything else, considering the lack of corridor-specific language.

Was in my mind and had to let it out."
4/11/2016,[EVENT] Armenia commences full mobilization in order to defend against any hostilities,"After Turkey's preparations to invade, the Armenian government quickly negotiated peace with Turkey. However, Turkey's military remains large and powerful. Despite the peace treaty with Turkey, uneasiness persists. The Armenian nation continues to fear an invasion by the Turkish military, especially because of the history of relations between the two countries. As a result of the massive threat that the Turkish military poses to the existence of the Armenian state, the Armenian military has decided to fully mobilize in order to best protect the nation. Immediately after the threat of an invasion formed, all 210,000 troops in the reserve personnel of the [Armenian Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Armenia) were called into action, raising the total of active personnel to 284,177 troops. This number includes personnel deployed in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Lebanon, who have already been withdrawn to Armenia. It also includes Armenian soldiers serving under the army of Armenia’s unrecognized neighbor Nagorno-Karabakh. Furthermore, after the near invasion, many patriotic Armenians flooded to the recruitment offices, with new recruits joining the army rapidly. However, the leadership of the Armenian Ministry of Defense was still unsatisfied, and decided to conscript every man and woman possible.The Armenian prime minister Hayk Petrosyan took to Republic Square of the Armenian capital Yerevan to announce the conscription with a well-prepared speech. *""On this dark moment of history, our small but proud nation finds itself closer to obliteration than ever, as it seems that the Turkish may be preparing to complete what they began over 100 years ago, with the Armenian Genocide. We must defend our motherland at all costs. As a result, I call upon as many possible able bodied Armenians, whether man or women, to take up arms, and defend our glorious motherland Hayastan. Although we are greatly outnumbered, I believe we can and will prevail. This is not the first time we, Armenia, have fought against overwhelming odds. Time and time again our people have fought off invaders, if we have to we will do it again. We shall not let this become the last chapter in Armenian history.”* After the prime minister finished his speech, a loud cry of Long Live Hayastan was heard throughout city. The Armenian people were ready to serve their motherland in the time of great need. The many volunteers in addition to the civilians conscripted by the government added 178,380 soldiers to the Armenian military, making the total number of troops serving under Armenia [467,071 soldiers](https://www.google.com/search?q=45%2C580+%2B+7%2C000+%2B+21%2C363+%2B+210%2C000+%2B+70+%2B+131+%2B+33&oq=45%2C580+%2B+7%2C000+%2B+21%2C363+%2B+210%2C000+%2B+70+%2B+131+%2B+33&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.40815j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=45%2C580+%2B+7%2C000+%2B+21%2C363+%2B+4%2C748+%2B+210%2C000+%2B+(2%2C973%2C000+*+0.06)). Armenia expects to have the 260,000 troops with current or previous military training to be ready to serve within 1-2 month, and additional new 178,380 soldiers to be fully prepared within 6 months. Armenia calls on Nagorno-Karabakh do the same, and defend against unexpected hostilities from Azerbaijan with its own military forces in case a conflict does occur, as it plans to use some Armenian forces currently in Nagorno-Karabakh for defense against a Turkish invasion. While the chances with of a Turkish conflict build, Armenia would like to remind Azerbaijan that if such a conflict does break out with Turkey, it would like Azerbaijan to stay neutral, and that if they do become involved, their oil pipelines and refineries will become the target of Armenia’s various missiles that are capable of quickly destroying them. Armenia is well-stocked, and its [1,223,395 firearms](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/armenia) fully satisfy all possible needs. Finally, in addition to all the Armenian soldiers being mobilized, Russia's [3,000 troops garrisoned in the 102nd military base in Armenia and its additional 2,000 troops in Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Armenia#Russia) will also be assuming defensive positions with the Armenian army.

10/7/2023,Why ARF (Dashnaktsutyun) serves Russias interest in Armenia and since when they become a poppet organization sabotaging the government effort to fortify independence of Armenia?,"ChatGPT 4.0  


>Your question seems to assume certain positions regarding the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), also known as Dashnaktsutyun, and its role in Armenian politics in relation to Russia. Here's a brief overview based on the information available up to my last update in January 2022:  
>  
>**Historical Context**:  
  
>  
>The ARF has been an influential political party in Armenia since the late 19th century. Historically, the party played significant roles during the Armenian Genocide, the First Republic of Armenia (1918-1920), and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.  
>  
>Russia and Armenia have a long and complex history. Armenia, being a small landlocked nation surrounded by often-hostile neighbors, has viewed Russia as a strategic partner for security and economic reasons.  
>  
>**Allegations of Serving Russian Interests**:  
  
>  
>There have been accusations and opinions suggesting that various Armenian political parties, including the ARF, are serving Russia's interests. Some of these claims argue that certain parties undermine efforts to fortify Armenian independence in favor of closer ties with Russia.  
>  
>It's essential to approach such allegations with caution and understand that political dynamics are multifaceted. I cannot conclusively state the ARF's motivations or whether they intentionally sabotage the Armenian government's efforts, but it's a topic of debate in Armenian political discourse.  
>  
>**Reasons for Close Ties with Russia**:  
  
>  
>Armenia's security concerns, particularly regarding Azerbaijan and Turkey, make Russia a vital ally. Russia has a military base in Armenia and is a significant supplier of arms to the country.  
>  
>Economically, Russia is one of Armenia's largest trade partners and investors.  
>  
>**Certainty & Sources**:  
  
>  
>My certainty level on this topic is moderate based on historical events and the geopolitical realities of the region up to 2022. However, political motivations can be subjective, and interpretations can vary.  
>  
>For a comprehensive analysis, you might want to refer to sources like [Radio Free Europe](https://www.rferl.org/) and academic journals that specialize in Caucasian studies.  
>  
>**Opinion**: Political parties, including the ARF, often have a mix of motivations and goals. While the ARF might prioritize close ties with Russia due to historical and strategic reasons, it's an oversimplification to label any party as merely a ""puppet"" organization. It's essential to evaluate their actions and stances in a broader context.

>The ARF (Armenian Revolutionary Federation), also known as Dashnaktsutyun, is a political party that has been active in Armenian politics for over 130 years. The ARF has a long history of cooperation with Russia, dating back to the late 19th century. This cooperation was based on a shared interest in opposing the Ottoman Empire, which was a common enemy of both Russia and the Armenians.  
>  
>After the Armenian Genocide and the establishment of the Soviet Union, the ARF was banned in Armenia, but it continued to operate in the Armenian diaspora. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the ARF was legalized in Armenia and became a major political force.  
>  
>The ARF's relationship with Russia has been complex over the years. On the one hand, the ARF has benefited from Russian support on a number of occasions, such as during the Nagorno-Karabakh War in the early 1990s. On the other hand, the ARF has also been critical of Russia's role in the region, particularly in recent years.  
>  
>In recent years, the ARF has been accused by some of serving Russia's interests in Armenia. This is partly due to the fact that the ARF has been a strong supporter of the Armenian government's close ties with Russia. The ARF has also been critical of Western efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Armenia.  
>  
>Some analysts argue that the ARF has become a poppet organization of Russia, sabotaging the government's efforts to fortify the independence of Armenia. They point to the ARF's support for the Armenian government's decision to join the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union in 2015 as evidence of this. The Eurasian Economic Union is seen by many as a tool of Russian influence in the region.  
>  
>Other analysts argue that the ARF is simply acting in what it believes to be the best interests of Armenia. They argue that the ARF believes that Armenia needs to maintain close ties with Russia in order to ensure its security and prosperity.  
>  
>It is important to note that the ARF is a diverse organization with a range of views on Russia. Not all members of the ARF agree with the party's current policies towards Russia. However, the ARF's leadership has been increasingly supportive of Russia in recent years.  
>  
>It is also important to note that the ARF is not the only political party in Armenia that has close ties with Russia. The ruling Republican Party of Armenia is also close to Russia. In fact, the Republican Party has been accused by some of being more beholden to Russia than the ARF.  
>  
>Ultimately, whether or not the ARF is serving Russia's interests in Armenia is a matter of opinion. There is no doubt that the ARF has been a strong supporter of the Armenian government's close ties with Russia. However, the ARF also has a long history of fighting for Armenian independence. It is possible that the ARF believes that close ties with Russia are necessary to ensure Armenia's security and prosperity.

**Pashinyan's first Facebook video.**

Dear compatriots, sisters and brothers. I have made an extremely difficult decision for myself and for all of us. I have signed a statement with the Presidents of Russia and Azerbaijan on ending the Karabakh war at 01:00. The text of the statement that has already been published is unspeakably painful for me personally and for our people.
 
I made that decision as a result of an in-depth analysis of the military situation and the assessment of the people who know the situation best. Also based on the belief that this is the best possible solution to the current situation. I will give a detailed message about all this in the coming days.
 
This is not a victory, but there is no defeat until you recognize yourself as being defeated. We will never recognize ourselves as being defeated and this should be the beginning of our era of national unification and rebirth. We need to analyze the years of our independence in order to plan our future and not repeat the mistakes of the past.
 
I kneel before all our martyrs. I bow to all our soldiers, officers, generals, volunteers who have defended and are defending the homeland with their lives. They selflessly saved the Artsakh population. We fought to the end. And we will win. Artsakh is standing.
 
Long live Armenia. Long live Artsakh.

&nbsp;

**Artsakh President Arayik Harutyunyan:**

Dear Compatriots. All day we have been discussing with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan our actions to stop the hostilities. I held discussions beforehand with the Artsakh Parliament and received their overwhelming approval.
 
Given the current dire situation, in order to avoid further heavy casualties and the complete loss of Artsakh, I agreed to end the war an hour earlier. As for the signed trilateral statement, I will talk about it in detail later.
 
I extend my deepest condolences and pride to the relatives of our martyrs and to all the people. We will still have time to have a dialogue with the relatives of the fallen heroes and our military about what to do. I pay tribute to all the people who made even a small contribution to the hard work of defending the Homeland.

&nbsp;

**What exactly is the agreement about?**

Karabakh used to be much smaller in the 1980s. Azerbaijan tried to invade it but failed. Armenians captured 7 adjacent territories as a buffer zone. Today's agreement returns those territories to Azerbaijan, plus some (still unclear). Just as in the 1980s, Karabakh doesn't officially get de-jure independence but Armenians get to continue to live there. 

Official text of the document from http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/64384

> Statement by President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia and President of the Russian Federation

> November 10, 202011:45

> We, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan and President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, state the following:

> 1\. A complete ceasefire and termination of all hostilities in the area of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is declared starting 12:00 am (midnight) Moscow time on November 10, 2020. The Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia, hereinafter referred to as the “Parties,” shall stop in their current positions.

> 2\. The Agdam District shall be returned to the Republic of Azerbaijan by November 20, 2020.

> 4\. The peacemaking forces of the Russian Federation shall be deployed concurrently with the withdrawal of the Armenian troops. The peacemaking forces of the Russian Federation will be deployed for five years, a term to be automatically extended for subsequent five-year terms unless either Party notifies about its intention to terminate this clause six months before the expiration of the current term.

> 5\. For more efficient monitoring of the Parties’ fulfilment of the agreements, a peacemaking centre shall be established to oversee the ceasefire.

> 6\. The Republic of Armenia shall return the Kalbajar District to the Republic of Azerbaijan by November 15, 2020, and the Lachin District by December 1, 2020.

> As agreed by the Parties, within the next three years, a plan will be outlined for the construction of a new route via the Lachin Corridor, to provide a connection between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, and the Russian peacemaking forces shall be subsequently relocated to protect the route.

> The Republic of Azerbaijan shall guarantee the security of persons, vehicles and cargo moving along the Lachin Corridor in both directions.

> 7\. Internally displaced persons and refugees shall return to the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent areas under the supervision of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

**Vladimir Putin**

""This creates conditions for a long-term peace agreement. An agreement that is fair to Armenians and Azeris.""

&nbsp;

**Pashinyan's second Facebook Live, after the riots in the government building.**

Right now I can't say a lot while the ceasefire is being established in order not to endanger peoples' lives. If I say a few things, it will become clear for many of you about what had been happening in the past month.
 
Today, those who are breaking the government building windows, are stubbing our soldiers from behind. One of the opposition politicians who demands my resignation, who is a General, routed from his Shosh positions on Sunday and returned to Armenia. Today he claims ""we stand with the army.""
 
I'm convinced that many of the angry protesters have good intentions and are honest. There are many of them. Some of them are families of fallen soldiers. I bow to them.
 
Today I was briefed that among the [riot provokers] there were groups of oligarchs. These are the people who stole from the soldier for 20 years, who stole from the army for 20 years, who paid no taxes for 20 years. Today they speak about ""treason"".
 
What business do they have in Yerevan? Haven't they heard the calls by the Artsakh president to come to an aid? What are they doing in Yerevan with a camouflage outfit? Now is the right opportunity for them to defend what they plundered, apparently.
 
Do you know why the rioters were able to freely break into the government building? Because every policeman and riot police are defending the front lines. My son is also in the front lines, and so is my wife. And I'm proud of that.
 
I understand that you expect substantive and detailed explanations. But why can't I give it to you right now? because there is a problem with information dissonance, every sentence during martial law and war has an impact on activities on front lines. The Facebook posts reach the front lines and the enemy positions very quickly. That's why I can't reveal many details today.
 
But I want you to understand one thing. The decision [agreement] was made by analyzing the military situation and consulting with experts who know the situation the best. Our glorious army fought against terrorists, NATO's second army, and Azerbaijan. 

Why couldn't we sign a better agreement? Because for 25 years we [refers to the former regime] made toasts for our soldiers and drank from bottles while knowing that the bottles were purchased with money stolen from the same soldier. We gave soldiers leftover food and weapons from 1980s while hoping all along that a war would not happen by stretching the negotiations just a bit longer.
 
Okay. You hoped there wouldn't be a war for 5,6, 15 years. But for how long? It would have to happen sooner or later. And I learned about its inevitability when I became PM and familiarized myself with what I inherited on the negotiating table. There was no longer an option to delay things. All options were exhausted.
 
And I did what I could do prepare us for the past 2.5 years. Our army has been fighting with honor for 44 days. I kneel before all martyrs and their families. I apologize to them for not being able to do better.
The agreement was signed not only based on the current situation but also on what could happen if the war continued. 

Don't fall for the actions of the hooligans, some of whom have felony cases against them and have stolen 80 billion. That stolen money is more than what All Armenia Fund has collected. 
That money could have been used for weapons, technology, drone, science, etc. And today these oligarchs incite riots so they can restore their right to plunder.
 
I admit that we haven't been able to recover enough stolen funds in the past 2.5 years because we tried to act legally.
 
I regret being unable to give you more details about the agreement because the situation is still unstable on the front lines. We cannot cause harm right now. I understand your emotions but we'll have an opportunity to speak in more detail. No one will escape justice, including me, if I'm guilty.
 
I urge all Armenians not to fall for provocations. More details will be given next week. I want you to know that I and the whole governmental apparatus did everything possible to avoid this outcome. Why did we fail? We will discuss that in detail and reveal the context soon.
 
All the organizers of today's riots will be held accountable. We cannot allow chaos. Some of them went to a front line briefly, took a Facebook photo, then escaped and came back when the battles began. Don't join them.
 
I serve all of you. Have no doubt that I acted in your best interest all along.

&nbsp;

Sometime during this time, the rioters heavily beat up Pashinyan's teammate and the third guy in command, the Speaker of the Parliament Ararat Mirzoyan.

Soldiers from Artsakh release a message urging for rioters to go home.

&nbsp;

**Pashinyan:** to all the citizens who are not affiliated with the violent rioters, please go home. To anyone who believes us and me, please prepare for a struggle. Have no doubt that there was no conspiracy against you. In these difficult times, we must stand together against the thieves and plunderers.

[the beaten] Ararat Mirzoyan is the type of man who accepted the agreement with tears in his eyes. Everyone in our team did. And some animals attack Mirzoyan and his child? An animal who probably couldn't beat anyone without repercussions for 2 years so they found an opportunity. They won't get away with this.
 
To anyone who understands what's happening, I call for you to prepare for revenge. Yes, we didn't deal properly with these corrupt oligarchs in time. All those HHK, BHK thieves, that traitor who left the position and routed.
 
Who is breaking into the govt building today? The [lists ex-oligarchs] who plundered and now they think their time has arrived? They are wrong. It's the time for citizen's revenge. Do the traitors think they can leave the burden of them selling the country on us? Not a chance.
 
We will go after the riot organizers, one by one. We'll go after specifically the corrupt segment of ARF (Dashnaks), too. We will organize a rally soon. And those who sold the country for money, those who think they can slip away under this chaos, are mistaken. Your mansions will be returned to people. We wrote a new asset forfeiture law that went into effect in September.
 
If you're against the criminal bandits, speak up. We have governors who are protecting borders while suffering from pneumonia and COVID, while today's chubby rioters weren't going there to substitute them. This is the story.

##Nagorno-Karabakh presidential adviser and ex-FM Davit Babayan was ""sacrificed"" to prevent the arrest of other officials

**TATUL HAKOBYAN, journalist:** I spoke with several Nagorno-Karabakh state officials who safely entered Armenia to understand the circumstances surrounding Davit Babayan's handover to Azerbaijani authorities in Shushi.

On September 28, Davit Babayan wrote that Azerbaijan was demanding his surrender, otherwise, there would be consequences for other individuals and Nagorno-Karabakh. He agreed to surrender. 

We also know that President Shahramanyan, after signing the decree to dissolve Nagorno-Karabakh, departed from Stepanakert to [Azeri-controlled] Shushi to meet Ali Nakhiyev, the head of Azerbaijani state security agency. In that meeting, they discussed the safe transfer of Nagorno-Karabakh's former leaders to Armenia [they weren't arrested at the time].

In order to agree to discuss it, Azerbaijan first demanded the handover of Davit Babayan. This is what Davit Babayan was referring to when he said his refusal would lead to consequences for many people. He was referring to other leaders.

President Shahramanyan's office vehicle drove Davit Babayan to Shushi, handed him over, and returned to Stepanakert. 

Shahramanyan and dozens of other Nagorno-Karabakh officials have been able to enter Armenia.

##Vladimir Putin about the arrest of Ruben Vardanyan and other Nagorno-Karabakh leaders by Azerbaijan 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan has arrested several members of the Nagorno-Karabakh administration, including Ruben Vardanyan, who is well-known here in Russia. Can we...

**PUTIN:** Vardanyan had renounced his Russian citizenship.

**REPORTER:** Can we urge the Azerbaijani government to show clemency?

**PUTIN:** We always have, and continue to do so. I spoke with Aliyev. We have also spoken in the past about Nagorno-Karabakh. Aliyev has always reassured me that he would ensure the rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians there. But there are no more Armenians left there. They all left. You know that everyone has left. There are no Armenians left there. Maybe a thousand. That's it. There is no one left there.  

As for the arrest of ex-leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh, I won't go into details but as far as I can tell, they aren't even welcome in Yerevan. I hope the Azerbaijani government will, after all, make a humanitarian gesture now that the territorial issues have been resolved. //

[video,](https://youtu.be/s1RqsaAhxG4?t=9)



##Vladimir Putin about the Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations and the 2020 war

**PUTIN:** After the fall of the USSR, ethnic clashes began between Armenians and Azeris. It started in Azerbaijan's Sumgayit and spread to Nagorno-Karabakh. 

Armenia, and not Nagorno-Karabakh, ended up controlling 20% of Azerbaijan's territories: Nagorno-Karabakh and the 7 surrounding regions. It continued for several decades. 

Over the past 15 years, we offered Armenians to make a compromise by returning 5 of the surrounding regions to Azerbaijan. This would maintain a land connection between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. 

But our friends from Nagorno-Karabakh repeatedly rejected the proposal, saying it would make them too vulnerable. We explained to them that Azerbaijan was growing stronger with the help of oil and gas, and that they should go for a compromise solution while there is still a chance. 

We even offered them to pass a UN Security Council resolution and ensure the safety of the Lachin corridor and the Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh. But they rejected the offer. They said they preferred to ""fight"", which led to the 2020 war. *[Armenians agreed to return the 5 regions but Azerbaijan rejected the idea and every time demanded more and more. Putin does not mention this.]*

During the 2020 war, I offered Armenia a ceasefire that would have stopped the Azerbaijani army. We already had an agreement with Azerbaijan, but Armenia rejected it. *[Pashinyan later revealed that Russia wanted to establish a corridor through Armenia's Syunik province and place it under the control of Russian peacekeepers, not to be confused with Russian border agents. Pashinyan said he was firmly against the ceasefire-for-corridor offer. This was around October 19.]*

Armenia said they'd rather continue to fight. In the end, we reached an agreement with Azerbaijan that they would stop after capturing Shushi. //

##Putin about Pashinyan 

**MARGARITA SIMONYAN:** Every normal Armenian understands that Pashinyan was brought to power to surrender Nagorno-Karabakh.

**PUTIN:** I disagree. He had no intentions of surrendering Nagorno-Karabakh. He even announced that Karabakh was part of Armenia. He was the first-ever Armenian leader to do so. Of course his position changed later. In my view he sincerely wanted to maintain the situation under control, there was no attempt to intentionally surrender anything.

##U.S. State Department about the ""secret"" meeting in Istanbul and the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh

**QUESTION:** Tell us about the secret meeting in Istanbul *[Context: US-EU-RU met to discuss the lifting of the blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh]*.

**STATE DEPT:** It wasn't really a ""secret"" meeting. We engage with stakeholders and interlocutors in the region quite regularly. We met in Istanbul to discuss urgent humanitarian issues around Nagorno-Karabakh.

**QUESTION:** Was it a meeting of Minsk Group co-chairs? 

**STATE DEPT:** It was – it took place at the working level.

**QUESTION:** Who initiated that? 

**STATE DEPT:** Can't go into specifics.

**QUESTION:** This is the first high-level meeting between U.S. and Russian officials since the war in Ukraine.

**STATE DEPT:** Again, it was a meeting that took place at the working level with a specific topic on the issue of humanitarian needs in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. That was the scope and the context of this meeting. Do not overinterpret this to mean anything else.

**QUESTION:** I wonder how frustrated are you that two days after that meeting, the dominos started falling? *[Azerbaijan attacked Nagorno-Karabakh]*

**STATE DEPT:** We’re concerned by the situation after the recent hostilities, and it has resulted in over 100,000 ethnic Armenians fleeing the Nagorno-Karabakh region into Armenia, and we’re closely monitoring the situation on the ground.

##European Parliament condemns Azerbaijan's violent seizure of Nagorno-Karabakh and calls for sanctions against Aliyev regime

The European Parliament adopted a resolution (Yes - 491, No - 9) strongly condemning the September 19 invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh. The MEPs called it a ""gross violation of international law and human rights"".

MEPs said the situation amounts to ethnic cleansing after 101,000 people were ""forced to flee"" their homeland. 

Parliament calls on the EU to adopt targeted sanctions against the government officials in Azerbaijan.

Parliament also calls on the EU to reduce its dependency on Azeri gas imports and to stop it completely in the event of another attack.

Parliament also condemns Hungary for blocking an earlier statement by EU Member States.

##Azerbaijan says its refusal to take part in the Granada meeting doesn't mean they are rejecting the Brussels platform as a whole

Azerbaijan said it will join the future AM-EU-AZ meetings.

Today's meeting in Granada took place without Azerbaijan. AM-EU-FR-GR discussed the events in the South Caucasus. The participants released a statement in support of Armenia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

There was also a meeting between Zelensky and Pashinyan. Zelenskty wrote, ""During our first-ever meeting, Armenian Prime Minister  Nikol Pashinyan and I focused on the security situation in the South Caucasus. Ukraine is interested in the region’s stability and friendly relations with its nations. We also discussed our bilateral cooperation and interregional economic projects.""

##Azerbaijan to Armenia: you misunderstood, we don't want THAT type of ""corridor""

**ELCHIN AMIRBEKOV (Aliyev office):** Armenians likely misunderstood us. We have no claim on these territories [of trade route]. We recognize it as the sovereign territory of Armenia. 

Another question is how the Armenians will ensure the security of this corridor. According to the Nov. 9 Statement, Russian border agents were supposed to ensure the safety of [Azeri] traffic [passing through Armenia]. However, it appears Armenians are reviewing that commitment because they no longer wish to grant that role to Russian border agents. //

##... ""corridor"" context

During the 2020 war, there was an attempt to convince Armenia to surrender the control of a narrow strip of land in southern Armenia to Russian peacekeepers, according to PM Pashinyan. It would be used as a corridor by Azerbaijan and Turkey, controlled by Russia. Armenia rejected the idea.

Under the 2020 ceasefire agreement, Armenia agreed to allow Russian border agents (who are already present in many parts of Armenia) to monitor the trade flow and safety. The plan was to install customs checkpoints and have them work jointly with Armenian agents.

However, Azerbaijan demanded only Russian border agents to be present on the trade route. Armenia said that would be the same as losing control over the land, and called it an attack on its sovereignty. Armenia said its agents must be present and have control over the trade route. Azerbaijan launched a military aggression and invaded parts of Armenia. Armenia did not change its position. 

To meet the terms under the Nov. 9 ceasefire agreement, Armenia agrees (according to NatSec Armen Grigoryan) for Russian border agents to use cameras and other modern tech to jointly monitor the trade route alongside their Armenian counterparts who would be on the ground. On the other side, Azerbaijan has broken almost every commitment under the Nov. 9 agreement.

##European Court of Human Rights rules in favor of Armenia in lawsuits brought by Azerbaijanis

⚖️ Gurbanov v. Armenia: The plaintiff's relative was a soldier who infiltrated into Armenian positions and killed 3 unsuspecting unarmed soldiers before being shot. Armenia returned his body to Azerbaijan. Armenia did not violate any laws in the process, did not unreasonably delay the return of the body, and there was no discrimination.

⚖️ Guliyev and Asgarov v. Armenia: The plaintiffs' relatives were Azeri saboteurs who infiltrated and murdered an Armenian teenager (civilian). They were caught by the Armenian army. Armenia did not deprive them of the ability to contact their families, said the Court. They were treated like other prisoners.

⚖️ Ghazaryan v. Azerbaijan: Azerbaijan arrested the plaintiff in 2018 and released in 2020. The Court has found that he was illegally tortured in Azerbaijan. His rights to liberty and personal integrity were also violated.

⚖️ Aliyev v. Armenia, Allahverdiyev v. Armenia, Hakobyan v. Azerbaijan, Ohanyan v. Azerbaijan: The plaintiffs claimed the defendant countries violated their property rights during the 2016 April war. The Court said it lacks jurisdiction over the alleged violations.

##update: Russia authorizes the entry of Armenian cognac

Earlier we learned that dozens of Armenian trucks were stuck in the checkpoint. An Armenian official said politics wasn't in play, and that it was likely caused by legitimate issues relating to counterfeit bottles. The trucks were allowed to proceed today after Russian agents took samples for inspection. Trucks moving other types of goods have not reported entry problems.

In my honest opinion, even though most nationalistic Armenians would probably object but they should just make up with Turks and join the NATO, Georgia is already planning to do so. All the problems in the area originates from Russia, Russia destroyed the peoples of Caucasus, put people against each other, committed genocide on Circassians and created anti-Christian feelings in the area that contributed in many Christian genocides in Ottoman Empire, today we are still experiencing the consequences of those days.

**Armenia Caucus Co-Chairs Issue Statement on Azerbaijani Attacks on Armenia**

WASHINGTON, DC – Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues Co-Chairs Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. (NJ-06), Gus M. Bilirakis (FL-12), Jackie Speier (CA-14), David G. Valadao (CA-21), and Adam B. Schiff (CA-28) issued the following statement on Azerbaijani attacks on Armenia:

“We strongly condemn the escalation of hostilities by Azerbaijani forces in southern Armenia. Yet again, President Aliyev is employing the same deadly attacks on sovereign Armenian territory to seek justification for his continued hostility and assaults since the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War and to force Armenia to capitulate to his unreasonable territorial demands. World leaders should not stand idly by and make false equivocations between the two sides. There is only one aggressor in this conflict that must be stopped. We urge the Biden Administration to take immediate action to halt Azerbaijan’s aggressions and finally hold Aliyev accountable for his destabilizing actions.”

I know there's tensions between the countries politically, especially since the am-az war last year. Should I expect any (incidental) hostility in eastern Turkey with the Armenian license plate? 

I'm an open minded person, i have Turkish friends and I'm not the type to judge or hold a grunt against an entire country. I think i will meet mainly hospitality and friendliness like in most countries I've traveled. I'm just curious to hear from people who actually live in Turkey what kind of attitude to expect when seeing an Armenian license plate. 

Thanks a lot in advance"

**04:33:** The Security Council, headed by Premier Pashinyan and President Khachaturyan, has summoned a meeting to discuss the attack. It was decided to contact Russia to activate the AM-RU Mutual Assistance agreement, and to contact the CSTO and UN Security Council.

This new aggression follows Baku’s serious breaches of the ceasefire on the Nagorno Karabakh line of contact in March and August.

##the parliament adopted a resolution addressing the border attack 

**Resolution:** 
We condemn the attack and express our full support to the Armenian Armed Forces, and call on our countrymen, regardless of political views, to unite around our military. 

Armenia is demanding the CSTO urgently take actions stemming from obligations assumed under the treaty to help preserve the territorial integrity of Armenia. 

We appeal to Russia to swiftly implement obligations enshrined in bilateral treaties.

The international community must condemn Azerbaijan in a strong and targeted manner for this aggression, which is a violation of the UN Charter prohibiting the use of force against territorial integrity. 

We expect from the UN Security Council an urgent discussion and action. //

##Pashinyan presented details and answered questions in Parliament 

**Pashinyan:** Last night Azerbaijan launched an attack on Armenia in 4 directions, and later added 2-3 more directions. They claim it was a response to a ""provocation"" by Armenia, but that is a total lie. I will shortly present the context behind this attack.

The defense ministry has confirmed 49 deaths but that number is expected to rise once they confirm and verify the information. They don't report information unless it's verified. 

Our soldiers fought heroically. Our sovereignty is built on their shoulders. As long as we have people like them, Armenia will have sovereignty. Armenia must be proud of its children. 

The battles are not as intense anymore, but the attacks continue in 1-2 directions. 

We summoned a Security Council meeting after the attack and made a decision to contact CSTO. We've also contacted Russia based on the 1997 Mutual Assitance agreement, and the UN Security Council.

At night I spoke with the heads of Russia, France, and Iran, and representatives of the US and EU. 

[source,](https://youtu.be/N93TmjLifcc?t=4921)

##Pashinyan presents the context behind Azerbaijan's aggression: 

**1) Nagorno Karabakh negotiation process.** 

In March 2022, Azerbaijan presented its 5-point document for peace. We responded positively, adding that it's necessary to supplement those 5 points with certain points that were missing. We agreed to use those principles to launch peace talks. 

At first, it appeared we had an understanding, but especially during the latest Brussels meeting it became clear that Azerbaijan refuses to discuss the principles proposed by us, which include:

a) Upholding the tripartite agreements reached earlier.

b) Nagorno Karabakh people's security and rights, and a status for Nagorno Karabakh that stems from people's rights and securities.

Azerbaijan's response was that they don't want to discuss Nagorno Karabakh with Armenia, because the conflict is ""resolved"" or ""it's an internal issue"".

As we've stated before, Armenia has no territorial claims against Azerbaijan and we're ready to discuss mutual recognition of each other's territorial integrity. It doesn't end there, however, because certain things need clarification. What do we mean by ""territorial integrity""? Will this include the Republic of Armenia territories that Azerbaijan occupied in the 1990s and May 2021? Azerbaijan did not give a clear response to this. 

**2) Azerbaijan expects Armenia to recognize Nagorno Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan.** 

If let's say these two issues are hypothetically addressed, does that means Azerbaijan will have no territorial claims against Armenia? During political discussions and statements, they officially claim that Azerbaijan will have no territorial claims, but when the discussions switch to border demarcation, it becomes clear that Azerbaijan intends to use the demarcation to raise certain issues based on their own illegal interpretations. Azeri politicians often talk about how even Yerevan and Syunik belong to Azerbaijan. 

If those were just simple interviews and empty statements, we would have ignored them, but facts point to this being part of Azerbaijan's official policy. 

As for the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, they claim the conflict no longer exists, therefore they have no reason to discuss it with Armenia, and that they can discuss it with international organizations and possibly with ""Karabakh Armenian representatives within the Constitution of Azerbaijan"", as they formulate.

**3) Unblocking communication routes.** 

As you already know, Azerbaijan is distorting the Nov. 9 agreement to demand a ""corridor"" through Armenia. Our stance was/is that we don't plan to give a ""corridor"" to anyone, but we are not against unblocking roads passing through Armenia. That would even be beneficial for Armenia. 

Every country in the region, including Armenia and Azerbaijan, must be able to use the unblocked roads in South Caucasus. That's what the Nov. 9 agreement states. As you already know, Russia's representative has confirmed that the agreement is for each state to maintain sovereignty over its roads. 

**4) Azerbaijan feels threatened by the strengthening of the Armenian army.**

Azerbaijan has stated after the war that in the event they see that the Armenian army is ""becoming dangerous"" and gaining strength, they will conduct a ""preemptive strike"", even though we have repeatedly stated that the goal of our military reforms is not to occupy Azeri lands, but to defend our territorial integrity.

There is already a process to reform the Armenian army. Azerbaijan is attempting to hinder this process.

##Pashinyan about the pro-Armenian parts of the 9 November 2020 ceasefire agreement: 

Under the heavy psychological state in 2020, the Nov. 9 ceasefire agreement was presented by my critics very negatively within Armenia. It wasn't perfect, but it contains 3 extremely important institutional statements:

a) It records the existence of the ""Nagorno Karabakh"" subject, and Azerbaijan's signature is on that document.

b) Nagorno Karabakh has a border (LoC) with Azerbaijan, it has Russian peacekeepers whose role is to protect the LoC and the people who live within the borders.

c) There is a Lachin corridor that guarantees a connection between Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh. Azerbaijan has no right to decide who gets to enter Nagorno Karabakh through this corridor.

[source,](https://youtu.be/N93TmjLifcc?t=6219)


##Pashinyan about Armenia's economy and the Peace Agenda:

Despite the global challenges, Armenia has seen economic successes. A few days ago the international [Economic Freedom Index was published](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/xa6l2u/sep92022_armenia_overtakes_georgia_in_fraser/), placing Armenia #11 among the 165 countries. 

Another goal of Azerbaijan's aggression is to break Armenia's economic development. A better economy means a stronger country. 

Armenia will develop rapidly under peaceful conditions. This is why we have adopted the Peace Agenda, and this is why Azerbaijan is against it. So when both Armenia and Azerbaijan publicly claim they want peace, you can guess which one is being dishonest about it.

Armenia must continue with the efforts to achieve peace in the region. We must develop our armed forces and strengthen our sovereignty. 

Besides strengthening our army, we must also clarify the mechanism and obligations within the framework of the security agreements with our partners. 

[source,](https://youtu.be/N93TmjLifcc?t=6491)



##Pashinyan: certain countries don't want Armenia to acquire weapons from others 

**MP:** Is there a country that's against Armenia purchasing weapons for self-defense? The emphasis is on weapons specifically for defense. This aggression will last a while so we are required to defend ourselves. This must be done simultaneously with peace talks.

**Pashinyan:** We must have a cold and direct conversation today. Normally I would refrain from saying this, but I will be maximally transparent today. 

At first, we must recognize that our will to defend ourselves is very important. As for weapons acquisition, this topic consists of 4 components: financial, political, technical, and transport.

a) Financial. We have the necessary financial resources to acquire weapons. That's what I meant while discussing Armenia's recent favorable economic stats. 

b) Political. Obviously not every country is ready to sell weapons to Armenia, but some are ready, while others are not ready to accept the fact that Armenia can buy a weapon from a state that's willing to sell the weapon. This ""lack of readiness"" by them has security ramifications.  

c) Technical. Certain countries [likely refers to Russia] want to sell weapons to Armenia, but they don't have the necessary arsenal. Their defense industry is fully booked for the years to come, including for internal consumption. Besides that, they don't want to lose the international market so they want to fulfill their obligations first.

d) Transport. Armenia has no sea access and cannot simply import weapons after paying for them. Very often the transport issues are equally or worse than the other aforementioned issues, for objective and subjective reasons. 

Does Armenia have the financial means to acquire weapons? Yes, we do.

Do we work on overcoming the political challenges? Day and night, without exaggeration.

##has Azerbaijan presented any evidence of the so-called ""provocation"" by Armenia? 

**MP:** Azerbaijan was making false allegations before the attack. Have they provided any evidence, even a falsified one, that it was Armenia who provoked this? After all, they have high-tech and surveillance drones with cameras. Has the international community demanded for Azerbaijan provide evidence? 

**Pashinyan:** Azerbaijan has always publicly admitted that they have an aggressive policy and plan to use force. Last year we proposed the mirrored withdrawal of troops from certain regions, but they rejected it. We also proposed for CSTO to send a monitoring mission on the AM-AZ border. 

##Pashinyan about the value of a ""peace agreement""

We will not sign a peace agreement that's in name only. A compromise does not always lead to peace. Just because we sign something that doesn't mean there will be actual peace. 

Let's say we recognize Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Will Azerbaijan return the territories it occupied in 2021 and 1990s? Let's say we demarcate borders and sign a peace agreement. Who will guarantee there won't be similar border aggression? An agreement without guarantees is just a paper. 

A peace agreement must be accompanied by conditions that ensure the peaceful co-existence of peoples of this region. 

There are plenty of historical examples of when ""peace"" agreements were signed, followed by wars. Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is one of them. We don't need one like that because it's not a true peace agreement. 

After the 2020 war, I received a barrage of criticism about ""what have you done to stop the war"", yet not once have I been asked ""what have you done to win the war"".

##Pashinyan about military reforms

**MP:** Are we investing enough to develop our military-industrial complex?

**Pashinyan:** This may sound strange but I don't always know which information has been published so far. One of the latest reforms envisages a raise for soldiers, not by 20%-30%, but by 3x. 

This year we raised the science funding by 83%. In 2019-2020 we doubled the funding for the military industry. 

Having proper institutions is an important component. You can fund a loose group of engineers but achieve no results due to a lack of institutional processes. This is why the state requires manufacturers to pass through various stages.

Today, the funding provided by the government is more than our military industry can absorb. Anyone who tells you otherwise is misleading you. ""Absorb"" includes passing through quality checks and going through certain procedures. Science is not a construction project to tell them ""start now and finish next year"". Even if the researchers fail to achieve the outcome, they gain valuable knowledge and experience that can be used elsewhere in the future. 

**MP:** Regarding army reforms. I've had the opportunity to meet many officers and they reported already feeling the results of certain reforms. I think the worthy response given by our soldiers last night is a testament. 

**Pashinyan:** Continuing on salaries. In 2019 we gave a significant raise to our servicemen. In 2020 we doubled and tripled the salary for certain titles. This is a continuous policy. But the problem is that it takes over 2 years to reform the army. It requires many years. The most important thing is to have a plan.

That plan has to take into account the geopolitical developments happening on the global scale. We know where to start and where to end, but choosing the path is what's complicated. //

##Central Bank revises economic outlook, now expects a whopping 12.9% growth in 2022

10/14/2023,Will azerbaijan be able to get rid of corruption?,"As far as i know, azerbaijan was a broken state in its eraly days, no one bought its oil, surrounded by 3 hostile nations of north, west and south(russia, armenia and Iran) and with a civil war broking out between armenian minority and azerbaijan, with an all-out support from armenia and armenian diaspora, azerbaijan got under arms embargo, while azerbaijan's cloest ally, turkey was in its worst days of its half a centry

Which limited azerbaijan's abality to fight back the armenians

With completion of gas pipelines from geogrians soil, azerbaijan found a new opertunity made by its own empty hands, abality to export oil and gas to turkey, and from turkey to europe, it simplyent an economic boom and Azerbaijan being the most growing economy from 2001 to 2011, with azerbaijani gdp in 2011 being 12 times more than what it was in 2001

The new geowth and money, alongside with turkish growth in military and economic capacity combined with Israeli help, meant azerbaijan was able to create more powerful army and finally beat armenians in 2020 and 2023.

But all this time, there was one problem, azerbaijan was in war for last 33 years and its people did not risk to vote for other parties(just like any other democratic nation in war time), so now in 2023 there is not really any powerful opposition group in azerbaijani politics

I belive eventually there eill be new leftust psrties in azerbaijani which will create a competition if elections, therefor making azerbaijan more democratic with numerous parties

The main quasstion of this theread is, will azerbaijan be able to beat its biggest enemy? I mean courruption ofcourse, giving aliyevs high public support since 2020 victory, he has the avality to perform better against corruption"
10/2/2019,It’s time we officially recognize Armenian genocide,"Turkey has been lately very hostile to our interests diplomatically. They had stayed as a staunch supporter of Pakistani foreign policy interests over the last few years. I don’t see the situation improving as long as Erdogan is in power. 

Armenia on the other hand has actually supported our interests in Kashmir (very few countries do this). Historically India also has hosted multiple Armenian Christians and Jews and these communities has been friendly to us. 

Armenian genocide is a very sensitive subject to Armenian people world wide. Millions of Armenians were slaughtered and displaced by Turkish forces and Turkey to this day has not apologized or even recognized that this has happened. 

India should use this opportunity to officially recognize the genocide. Armenia and Armenian people would see this as a gesture of friendship. Now, for folks saying that Turkey would cut diplomatic or economic relationship with us for that - no. A lot of countries have already recognized this. Plus embargoing a nation like India would not work that well in this day and age of globalization. The best they could do is protest."

9/20/2023,"""BREAKING: Azerbaijan launches full-scale attack on Artsakh."" A second active Armenian Genocide is imminent.","Azerbaijan is bombing Stepanakert, the capital of the Armenian breakaway republic of Artsakh, with a population if 120,000 with 30,000 of those being children. They are doing this with the explicit backing of Turkey (a NATO member), with drones and other weapons systems sold to them by Israel.

The aim of these attacks is to destroy the Artsakh self-defence forces and dismantle the self-governing institutions of Artsakh. This would effectively force the Armenian population out of the territory.

And before anybody bangs on about how Armenia is part of CSTO, Russia turned their back on their former colonial holding that is Armenia to go fuck up in Ukraine, but Azerbaijan has been actively laundering Russian oil and gas to export to the EU and US to bypass sanctions.

Russia brokered a ceasefire after the 2020 war with Azerbaijan and their ""peacekeeper"" forces have done FUCK ALL to maintain this and sat by as Azerbaijan cut off the Lachin Corridor that was the only road providing aid to Artsakh from the Republic of Armenia. They will continue to do fuck all, not only because they are stuck in Ukraine losing soldiers and armour, but because Russia needs Azerbaijan to launder their oil and gas...while the EU and US will only wag their finger at Azerbaijan while they benefit from this laundered gas.

This offensive comes amidst a 9 month blockade that has deprived Artsakh of basic necessities like food and medicine, via the Lachin Corridor. Fuel shortages have severely hampered ambulances and cars, leaving civilians unable to locate their children and to transport them to bomb shelters.

On top of all of this, in the lead-up, the Azeri government established s military park dehumanising Armenians, created a war logo, a postage stamp depicting the extermination of Armenians...and the empty words of the EU and US, carrying on as if they didn't think this was expected?

The Azeris have been explicit, even bragging, about their intention to ethnically cleanse the Armenian population of Artsakh (Karabakh). This isn't some minor border scuffle, this is an operation to exterminate thousands of lives on ethnic grounds. It had been openly discussing these plans for months, even issuing explicit threats to the Republic of Armenia and Artsakh through various diplomatic channels and pro-government experts.

This is just the start, Azerbaijan has made it clear that not only do they intend to commit genocide in Artsakh, but that they intend on taking the province of Syunik, from the Republic of Armenia to connect the Azeri province of Nakhchivan that is cut off from Azerbaijan by the Armenian province.

Iran is on the southern border of Syunik and Azerbaijan, they have been trading and sending aid to Armenia. They are one of the few friends Armenia has, most likely given that Turkey and Azerbaijan are hostil to Iran."
1/3/2023,What do Turkish people think about Armenians?,"Okay, I bet it is a pretty sensitive question, but I want to clarify that one.

My name is Ada, I am trans girl and an ethnic Western and Karabakh Armenian with quite significant amount of Turkish blood. A lot of people from my family think that Turkey and Armenia will never ever be together and are mortal enemies, but by being in Istanbul, honestly, I didn't encounter any hostility, more friendly attitude. So:

What do you personally think about Armenians, Armenian culture and the country itself."
10/8/2023,"Now all of a sudden the whole world is supposed to stand with israel, send aid, weapons, support, condemnation etc ?","While israel themselves stood by and watched while Armenian civilians were beheaded old men, woman didn't matter. The azerbayjani military beheaded civilians in their own homes while others were applauding and laughing. This is recorded. Destruction of homes Churches even graves, assassinations, execution of civilians woman children elderly, kidnappings, etc all recorded on camera committed by azerbayjanis and their military. 

Did israel say anything? The slightest condemnation? No, actually they delivered more and more weapons to azerbayjan and even helped azerbayjan with massive cyber terror against Armenia. Probably helped them with military advisors and wouldn't be surprised if they had a hand in bringing over those syrian terrorists to help azerbayjanis kill Armenians.

But now they expect the whole world to go crazy over an attack by those israel themselves have build a prison around and bombed the living daylight out of? Now those are according to israel dangerous terrorists that wants to kill civilians and anybody that doesn't stand with israel are a terrorist supporter, right? 

What would israel say if somebody start to send them advanced weapons, support etc? They would go crazy and call you a nazi that have no right to live, that must be stopped at any cost.

Also have in mind azerbayjanis have massacered Armenians many times, even in Kharabakh, before 1990. These massacres have been happening for at least hundred years. Armenians of Kharabakh finally managed to resist and defend themselves and their historical lands. But israel is making sure that they also finally will be massacred.They have no problem with it. No terrorism in that right?

But now, when people they have kept prisioned for years, bombarded, inprisioned, kidnapped, deprived of food water and medicine (same tactics as aliyev) are making resistance and fighting back attacking them, then that is terrorism! That is cold blooded murderers that must be stopped at any price and the whole world should of course support israel.

NOW, that's what I call a nasty hypocrite.

Btw, US is already (within 24h of the clashes starting) on the way sending massive aid package to israel. But Christian Armenians in Artsakh terrorized starved ethnically cleansed for months and months and months children woman elderly, infront of their eyes we got ""The US urges both parties to end hostilities"".

5/14/2023,Two soldiers killed in new Azerbaijan-Armenia clash ahead of peace talks,"Troops from Azerbaijan and Armenia exchanged fire with weapons including mortars and drones on their joint border on Friday, killing one soldier from each side two days before top-level talks on a long-term peace deal.

It was the second straight day of exchanges of fire - ahead of Sunday's planned meeting in Brussels between Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azeri President Ilham Aliyev.

One Azeri soldier died in Thursday's hostilities.

The two ex-Soviet states have fought two wars in 30 years focusing on the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated mainly by ethnic Armenians.

4/2/2022,2020 Karabakh and 2022 Ukraine: What do these wars have in common?,"Analysing Ukraine hostilities, the experts notice similarities in the information policy currently implemented by the Ukrainian authorities and the leadership of Armenia during the the 44-day war in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan  did not stop the brutal war since he was waiting for assistance from the Western partners. Armenian military-political leadership expected that Washington would be guided by Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, passed in October 1992. As the Democratic presidential nominee, Biden was critical of Azerbaijan’s role in the outbreak of fighting with Armenia, saying Baku instigated the fighting while calling on then-President Trump to block military assistance to Azerbaijan, specifically to withdraw the waiver under section 907. While Yerevan was under the delusion, the war claimed the lives of 150-200 Armenians daily.

As in 2020, American and British troops did not come to the Armenian mountains, so in 2022 they will not be in the Ukrainian Black Earth region. Zelensky's illusions are dispelled day by day.

The wars of 2020 and 2022 have a lot in common, but they have a number of differences. Thus, the ""Western civilized community"" ignores the war crimes of Azerbaijan, including the facts of the use of phosphorus weapons.

At the same time, the deputies of the European Parliament give a standing ovation to Volodymyr Zelensky. European officials applaud not because of support for Ukraine, but because they welcome the president of the country, who is ready to turn his own people into cannon fodder in the confrontation with Russia. Yes, the West is ready to fight to the last. Until the last Ukrainian.

Meanwhile, while the Aliyev government continues to take an offensive stance, Joe Biden signed a $45 million aid package for Armenia, while not supporting Karabakh and the thousands of civilians who became refugees as a result of Baku's ethnic cleansing. This is clearly the wrong signal for Baku, which has received more than $164 million from the United States over the past decade.

As in Ukraine, Washington and the EU aim to strengthen their positions in Armenia, leaving Azerbaijan alone with the aggression."

We continue to work with our allies and partners about what a more long-term mission ought to look like. We think there ought to be an international monitoring mission there to observe and guarantee them.

##Russia has betrayed Armenian people by standing aside in Nagorno-Karabakh: EU's Charles Michel criticizes Russia and Azerbaijan

**MICHEL:** It is clear that Russia has betrayed the Armenian people. Russia wanted to have soldiers on the ground to guarantee this peace and security agreement. But we see that the [Azerbaijani] military operation was launched without the slightest reaction from the Russian peacekeepers. The European Union, on the other hand, had no military presence on the ground. //

EuroNews writes:

>Baku recently regained control of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenian separatists after launching a military offensive. An estimated 100,000 ethnic Armenians have since fled in fear of persecution as Azerbaijani forces tighten their grip on the region. 

>Experts say Baku's actions amount to a war crime, and Armenia has accused [Azerbaijan] of pursuing ethnic cleansing. 

>Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has also condemned Russia for ignoring signs of Baku’s escalation and failing to protect Armenians

**CHARLES MICHEL:** I am extremely disappointed by the decision that was taken by Azerbaijan and I have expressed that very firmly to President Aliyev. It’s now up to Azerbaijan to show goodwill by engaging while respecting international law to protect the rights and security of the entire population that lives in Azerbaijan, including the Armenian population.

We are very committed to supporting Armenia, which is receiving a high number of refugees who have left their home region in Nagorno-Karabakh.

We also need to remain engaged at a political and diplomatic level to make sure that there’s a very clear reaffirmation of the respect for the territorial integrity of Armenia. //

##Lawsuit Says New Hampshire Governor's Family May Profit Off Humanitarian Crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh: The Daily Beast

>A Sununu-linked mining company prepares to exploit resources in a disputed region as ethnic Armenians flee, according to legal docs and other public records.

...

>John Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor and ex-White House chief-of-staff—held stakes and positions in a U.K.-based firm that secured mining rights within the province from Baku, rights only an Azerbaijani reconquest could guarantee. Public records, news reports, and corporate filings support many of the suit’s factual assertions.

...

>[Sununu's] office also would not pledge that the governor would forfeit any potential returns from the company’s prospective business in Nagorno-Karabakh, so as not to profit from Azerbaijan’s alleged ethnic cleansing

...

>The lawsuit highlights several subsequent events: on March 31 [of 2016] Azeri President Ilham Aliyev met with John Sununu [in Washington D.C.], and the next day, Azeri forces attacked Nagorno-Karabakh, an advance the lawsuit suggests aimed at Demirli [town where NK Armenians operated a processing plant]. After four days of fighting, Aliyev’s forces withdrew.

##Armenian parliament ratifies the Rome Statute || How it unfolded  || What was the opposition saying shortly after the coup in Nagorno-Karabakh? || International response

A heated conversation ensued between the ruling and pro-Russian opposition MPs. The opposition accused the Pashinyan administration of surrendering Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan and of launching an ""unconstitutional"" process to ratify the Rome Statute [against Russia's wishes]. A ruling party MP, in turn, accused the opposition of being Russia's agents:

**Ruling MP:** Do you think we have forgotten your euphoria when you carried out a coup and hijacked power in Nagorno-Karabakh, and how you announced that thanks to the coup, Nagorno-Karabakh and Russia were strong allies now? Where is your ""ally"" now? 

Wasn't that you who announced that ""patriots have finally taken control of Nagorno-Karabakh""? Which patriots? The ones that signed the dissolution of Nagorno-Karabakh? The history repeats. Every capitulation in our modern history was signed by the ARF. The Nov. 9 statement was far from being a capitulation. But you went and signed the real one. 

**Oppo MP (from her seat):** Who are YOU? You are the enemy of Armenia!

**Ruling MP:** Still not an agent of a foreign state, tho...

*[oppositoon benches explode in boos and chants, Speaker intervenes to establish order but the shouting continues]*

**Ruling MP:** For 3 years you've knocked on every possible door, looking for help to hijack power in Armenia. You couldn't do it here, but you succeeded in Nagorno-Karabakh accompanied by loud cheers and congratulations. We saw the outcome a week later.

**Oppo MP:** You abandoned Nagorno-Karabakh and didn't provide support during the September 19 attack.

**Ruling MP:** I'm going to play an episode from [Robert Kocharyan's] TV5 media outlet's coverage of the coup in Nagorno-Karabakh. [VIDEO: TV5 anchor berates the ousted Nagorno-Karabakh president Arayik and says the new regime won't follow Pashinyan's plan; opposition cheers the coup and believes that Nagorno-Karabakh has finally rediscovered its true identity by becoming a factor whose opinion will need to be taken into account; a ranking opposition MP says Pashinyan was lying about Nagorno-Karabakh not having true allies on the international arena and that Russia is the true ally of Nagorno-Karabakh; opposition MP notes that only Russia has not condemned the coup in Nagorno-Karabakh; opposition announes that ""patriots"" have taken over Nagorno-Karabakh and that now it's time to do the same in Armenia. The ruling MP stops the video.] //

#... approved

The government presented the Rome Statute for ratification. The opposition voted against (22), the ruling party voted in favor (60). 

The opposition party ARF is concerned that the Statute could prevent Armenia from forcefully liberating Nagorno-Karabakh in the future because it would target specific Armenian military commanders and generals if there was an attempt.  

##... foreign reaction

**KOSACHEV, Russian Senator:** Unfortunately, Armenia, after all, has taken this clearly unfriendly step towards Russia. There were no forces in the Armenian parliament that would have been able to stop the process of legal enslavement of this country by the Hague. // *[Russia believes the ratification is a step against Vladimir Putin, who has a warrant for his arrest for kidnapping and ""re-educating"" Ukrainian children. Armenia said it will use loopholes in order not to arrest Putin, but that hasn't been enough for Kremlin mouthpieces who have adopted a hostile stance towards Armenia in order to appease Russia's allies Turkey and Azerbaijan.]*

**VOROBYOV, Russian deputy speaker:** The decision of the Armenian parliamentarians destroys the constructive and reliable relations that were formed within the framework of the Russian-Armenian inter-parliamentary commission. But I am confident that no force will be able to destroy the age-old friendship of the Russian and Armenian peoples. //

**FRANCE:** We welcome Armenia's decision to ratify the Rome Statute and become a state party to the International Criminal Court. Fighting impunity for crimes is a condition for peace and stability.

##France confirms plans to provide military support to Armenia 

French FM Catherine Colonna visited Armenia on Tuesday and met FM Mirzoyan and PM Pashinyan. The latter presented the situation around the ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh.

France and Armenia have already reached an agreement on military cooperation. There are also discussions around additional cooperation. FM Colonna won't disclose details in order not to provoke Azerbaijan. 

France did not demand for Armenia to officially leave CSTO as a prerequisite.

##Russian customs agents are throttling the import of Armenian cognac 

The troubles began in March-April after Russian customs agents allegedly discovered fake bottles. Only products from specific companies were being pulled over for inspection at the time.

The import issues have since intensified. Now they block products by every exporter and force them to go through lengthy checks. An inspection can last up to a month. 

Armenia's representative at the Upper Lars border checkpoint does not believe politics is in play. He does not rule out actual issues with counterfeit products.

##an unknown army general has expressed willingness to join the pro-Russian opposition that wants to remove Pashinyan with force: opposition MP

Opposition leader Vazgen Manukyan [had earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16wfz9g/nagornokarabakh_depopulation_war_crimes/) urged the army to organize a coup against Pashinyan. A few days later, his fellow opposition MP Ruben Hakobyan gave an interview:

**REPORTER:** You [opposition forces] told the population that Pashinyan surrendered Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan. Thousands of people listened to you and gathered in the Republic Square. But within just two days, people began to whistle your speeches. It's all on video. People were chanting *""enough with your speeches, just tell us what to do""*. Your rallies died down 2-3 days later. Don't you think your [low rating and weakness] is responsible for Pashinyan remaining in power?

**HAKOBYAN:** The National Committee had adopted the strategy of impeaching Pashinyan. *[The National Committee is basically a big-brain brother of ""Vernatun"" created by pro-Russian forces to manage the country after Pashinyan. It's the continuation of their failed 2021 strategy, which in turn was a copycat of a successful strategy executed during the 1st Karabakh war.]* The problem is, if you adopt impeachment as the strategy, especially if it's going to take place as early as October 4 [before the Granada meeting], you are legally required to disclose the name of your candidate for PM.

A few days ago, a ranking army official met me at night and asked me to give the name of our candidate for PM so they could approach and speak with the candidate. People want to know who the proposed replacement is.

**REPORTER:** Does the opposition even know who its candidate is going to be?

**HAKOBYAN:** Look. It's not necessary to politically rape Yerevan [by closing streets]. What we needed was to organize one massive nationwide rally near the Parliament building on October 4th and *force* the ruling party to impeach Pashinyan. We should have adopted Pashinyan's own strategy when he took over the parliament with only 7 MPs. What we see today is not the government defeating the opposition, but the opposition defeating itself.

8/31/2023,France during and after the first Nagorno-Karabakh war,"With France popping up in the news more often these days, I thought it would be interesting to share  this piece of history that some people may not be aware of.  

In April of 1993 the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 822, which I’m sure many here are familiar with. The resolution has a particular passage that specifically mentioned Kəlbəcər.

>Noting with alarm the escalation in armed hostilities and, in particular, the latest invasion of the Kelbadjar district of the Republic of Azerbaijan by local Armenian forces.

The source I linked in this post is a declassified US state department cable from 1993, which actually details how that specific point in the resolution was negotiated, particularly the language “local Armenian forces.”  This is on page 15 of the linked document:

>IN EARLIER INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS, COUNCIL MEMBERS SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME REACHING AGREEMENT ON THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE STATEMENT. AMB. MERIMEE (FRANCE) ASSERTED THAT THE LANGUAGE BEING SUGGESTED BY, INTER ALIA, THE U.S., WAS TOO SPECIFIC IN VIEW OF THE LIMITED INFORMATION COUNCIL MEMBERS HAD ABOUT THE SITUATION. 

It doesn’t reveal what language the United States was suggesting, but the implication is that the Us wanted to name the Republic of Armenia specifically as the aggressor.

>HE ALSO TOOK ISSUE WITH EMPLOYING CHAPTER VII LANGUAGE, SUGGESTING INSTEAD, A CHAPTER VI FORMULATION.

UN chapter VII would have meant UN approval of sanctions or international military force as a coercive measure to ensure the parties comply with the resolution,  while chapter VI only asks the parties to reach a peace agreement.  France did not want UN approval for sanctions and peacekeepers to be used against the aggressors.

>AMB. ALBRIGHT  POINTED OUT THAT ALTHOUGH
SOME OF THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION MAY BE IN DOUBT, THERE WAS NO QUESTIONING THAT AN OFFENSIVE WAS BEING CONDUCTED BY ETHNIC ARMENIAN FORCES IN THE KELBADJAR DISTRICT.

That’s Madeleine Albright, first female Secretary of State for the the US. A very accomplished woman, whose family had escaped both the Nazi and Communist occupations of Czechoslovakia.  She’s also the one who read out this UNSC resolution.

>COUNCIL MEMBERS FINALLY AGREED TO COMPROMISE LANGUAGE FOR THE PARAGRAPH, INCLUDING REFERENCE TO AN INVASION BY “LOCAL ARMENIAN FORCES”

And this is where the implication comes that the United States wanted to name the invaders as either “Armenian Forces” or “Republic of Armenia Forces” and had to compromise due to the objections of France."
1/25/2023,The impact of 2022 Ukrainian events on the Caucasian Balkans,"*he fighting in Ukraine affects the Caucasus region, the arena of the clash of interests of global and regional powers. This region is also known as the Caucasian Balkans for its conflict potential.*

## Georgia's position on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict

Tbilisi officially expressed support for Kyiv. Nevertheless, the introduction of anti-Russian restrictions would be a powerful blow to the Georgian economy. So the republic's leadership refused to apply tough economic sanctions, joining the financial restrictions imposed by the US and EU.

Georgia also refused to return weapons received in 2008 from Kyiv (Buk anti-aircraft missile systems and Javelin anti-tank systems), as well as to provide Ukraine other weapons.

## The military policy of Azerbaijan

The Republic of Azerbaijan has taken a rather controversial position regarding the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Just two days before the outbreak of hostilities, Aliyev and Putin signed a declaration on allied cooperation. The leadership of the so-called Land of Fire has demonstrated its intention to strengthen the military-political alliance with Turkey, officially confirmed by the Shusha Declaration on June 15, 2021.

Realizing Moscow's lack of opportunity to settle the Ukrainian issue quickly, the Azerbaijani leadership tightened its policy towards Armenia and the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR, in Armenia it is also known as the Republic of Artsakh). Already in March, Baku seized the strategically important Parukh height and blocked the transit of natural gas, blocking the pipeline between Stepanakert and Goris. In August, the Azerbaijani National Army captured strategically important heights near the city of Berdzor, taking early control of the old road route in the Lachin corridor (a six-kilometer mountain corridor connecting Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh).

On the night of September 13, 2022, after major failures of the Russian army in the Kharkiv region, Azerbaijan attacked air defense systems and artillery based in Armenia near the cities of Vardenis, Goris, Sotk and Jermuk. The parties reached an agreement on a ceasefire only by the evening of September 14th. During the hostilities, according to official data, 204 Armenian and 80 Azerbaijani servicemen were killed or went missing. This aggravation is the most serious and unprecedented escalation after the Second Karabakh War (2020).

The year ended with a protest action by Azerbaijani environmentalists and NGO representatives near the city of Shushi on one of the sections of the Lachin corridor. The activists blocked transport links from the unrecognized republic.

## Key events of 2022 for Armenia

Despite the Baku's aggression, the year turned out to be successful for Armenia from an economic point of view. A sharp increase in trade due to anti-Russian sanctions and a consumer boom with pumping money into Armenian banks due to the relocation of tens of thousands of relocators from Russia and Belarus provided the republic with double-digit GDP growth (13-14%). 

The influx of foreign currency led to the appreciation of the dram against the US dollar by 22% (the highest rate in the world), and the level of assets of local banks increased. Experts assumed that the country's banking system would be used for the transfer of Russian financial flows to the West. But it did not happen.

Pashinyan's office failed to use the situation to improve the social environment and reduce poverty through income redistribution. However, the opposition did not enlist the support of broad sections of the population.

The results of Yerevan's foreign policy activity are depressing. Throughout 2022, the Armenian establishment demonstrated its readiness for peace at any cost. And the first step on this path was taken during the trilateral meeting of the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, mediated by the head of the European Council Charles Michel in Brussels this spring. Pashinyan claimed the expectation of the world community from Armenia to lower the bar of demands on the status of Artsakh.

Thus, the de facto collapse of the OSCE Minsk Group became extremely negative for Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, when two of the three co-chairs (the United States and France) refused to cooperate with Moscow on this platform after the start of the Ukrainian events. As a result, as in the first half of the 1990s, alternative formats for resolving the conflict became more active.

During their October meeting in Prague, Pashinyan and Aliyev agreed that ""Armenia and Azerbaijan reaffirmed their commitment to the UN Charter and the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1991, through which both sides recognize each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty"". This fact was regarded as Yerevan's recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan, even by the Russian side, which repeatedly offers an alternative negotiating format and a settlement plan to the Western one. It is about leaving the status of the NKR for the future.

The Armenian authorities are ready to sacrifice Artsakh, as they have set a course to break allied relations with Russia and reorient to the West, as usual, without calculating the consequences of their steps for the people. The year 2023 will pass under the banner of a choice between Moscow and Brussels, a struggle to keep Artsakh Armenian.

Meanwhile, Pashinyan and deputies from the ruling ""Civil Contract"" avoid mentioning the term ""Republic of Artsakh"". The current government actively promotes the idea that it was the former authorities who supposedly recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan with the Alma-Ata Declaration. However, Yerevan and Baku were negotiating for almost 30 years. Why did 2022 war happen if the former authorities had already recognized Karabakh as Azerbaijani?

*While Moscow is busy by Kyiv, and Yerevan does not offer serious resistance, pledging Brussels, Baku is trying to finally close the Karabakh issue. Ilham Aliyev intends to seize strategically important heights and positions in Armenia to deprive the republic of the opportunity to effectively resist or plan revenge even if Pashinyan resigns.*

4/19/2022,Citizenship/residence for military service for Russians?,"Hi.

Seems like Armenians very fearful of being outgunned in case of a potential aggression and being left alone while facing their potentially hostile Turkic neighbors (Azerbaijan/Turkey).

Then why don't you petition your Parliament MPs/Government/President (whoever is in charge of overseeing grassroots initiatives coming from Armenia's citizens) to institute the possibility of issuing permanent residence/citizenship in exchange for military service?

It will increase your potential recruitment base, greatly expanding your defensive capabilities against any potential hostile action. A lot of Russians fleeing their madman Putin will happily use the opportunity and join the army, compensating for your lack of necessary manpower for self-defence."
10/6/2021,Is Iran tricking Armenia?,"Having been alienated by its neighbors, Armenia immediately seized the opportunity to improve relations with Iran in the face of exacerbating relations with Azerbaijan. From a geopolitical perspective, it appears as a strategic choice. 

&#x200B;

For decades, except for Armenia, Azerbaijan has had good relations with virtually any country in the region and the world. Armenia realizes that to gain political leverage over Azerbaijan, it needs to side with countries hostile to Azerbaijan and Turkey. Besides, it believes that if AZ-IR relations deteriorate completely, Azerbaijan's dependence on Georgia will increase, and there will be pressure on Azerbaijan to make concessions in peace dialogues with Armenia. More importantly, Armenia hopes that Iran would attack Azerbaijan and severely weaken its military capabilities, thereby would allow it to regain the territories lost during the war.

&#x200B;

However, the reality is more complex and needs to be scrutinized meticulously. Iran (after Georgia) has been the biggest gainer of Armenia's blockade. Unblocking the transportation and communication routes will gradually increase Armenia's geopolitical and economic role while severely damage Iran's already troubled economy. Iran is neither concerned because Armenia might lose its sovereignty over the Zangezur corridor nor Azerbaijan deepens its relations with Israel, rather it is worried about losing its position to Armenia in the East-West transportation flow.

Following the [Treaty of Tabriz](https://www.reddit.com/r/empirepowers/comments/13w1lh7/diplomacy_the_end_of_the_ottomansafavid_war_of/), an agreement has been reached with the Safavids. Although we did not achieve all we could have hoped for, Georgia has regained control of its capital city and the important religious site of the Apostolic See in Echmiadzin. The population of the region has welcomed our return with open arms, but a serious challenge to our governance remains. We have publicly called for hostilities to cease, as have Ottoman and Safavid diplomats. Although wanton violence and pillaging seems to be an accepted norm in Ismail’s realm, we must set a better example. The continued presence of a hostile army in our territory cannot be accepted. Before we can celebrate our victory we must focus on securing the southern frontier. It is time to use the resources at our disposal to crush these Safavid deserters.

Our army near Shaki will attempt to withdraw in good order, again offering asylum to the Khan of Shaki at our court. Negotiations are underway with the Meliks of Karabakh, who have been overrun with ghazi brigands. They have pledged loyalty to us, and Ismail has relinquished his claim over their lands. We will liberate their lands once we have liberated the remainder of Armenia.

It is time to make an example of the brigands pillaging Armenia. Ismail has again shown his true colors, more interested in loot than in establishing government.  

**[S]**
  

Because the raiders which have declined to leave Armenia are weighed down with ill-gotten treasure, we have a clear opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to this region. The portion of our southern army returning from Tabriz will advance from the south, aided by returning Moldavian troops on their way to Batumi. 

The group retreating in Armenia will attempt to regain control over the region, reinforcing Yerevan and Echmiadzin in preparation for the arrival of the other troops from Shaki and from Tabriz. This group should avoid attacking until reinforcements arrive.

Our northern army will reinforce and advance over the mountains toward Giorgiskalaki, Echmiadzin, and Yerevan. This group will then make preparations to attack the thieves in a sweeping motion along the Aras River. Prince Demetre will come to the aid of the forces currently in Armenia.

Just as we previously delivered grain to Guria, Shaki and Tabriz, 30000 florins of additional funding will be disbursed to ensure that starvation and pillaging be kept to a minimum, and that the ties of the local church to our monarchy be strengthened as much as possible. Another delivery of grain will reduce the pressure on the farms of Armenia, which may not reap a normal harvest this year. This funding will be disbursed behind the advance as our armies see fit, with effort taken to protect this shipment from the marauders as our army advances from the Mtkvari valley.

As our armies sweep generally from west to east, we will attempt to find favorable terrain for our army and skirmish opportunistically. The rebel khan does not deserve to sleep well at night, so we will harass his camp whenever he pauses to regroup.

Our primary objectives include the redistribution of the Shia ghazis’ wealth to the local church and peasantry, the future judgement of these raiders in public judgements overseen by Georgians and Armenians, and the normalization of Georgian authority in the areas recently overrun by the invaders. If he is captured alive, the rebel khan will be paraded publicly and imprisoned for later judgment as we see fit.

11/5/2020,"Article | No major power has attempted in earnest to mediate the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis, and some have actively participated in keeping the situation ablaze.","BESA Center Perspectives Paper No. 1,799, November 4, 2020

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: No major power has attempted in earnest to mediate the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis, and some have actively participated in keeping the situation ablaze. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan have been actively preparing for hostilities, but Armenia finds itself at a political and military disadvantage.

Anyone who has been following world politics for the past 30 years must feel overwhelmed these days by déja vu. At times it seems as though decades-old headlines are being recycled.

The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh is one example of this phenomenon. The conflict was artificially created by the Soviets, starting with Stalin, who paid special attention to the Caucasus and the drawing of its borders in order to ensure that nobody there would feel confident, secure, or satisfied. The clash flared up in the last years of Soviet Union, culminating in direct military conflict and an Armenian victory—and both sides thoroughly exhausted.

That did not end the conflict, which continued to simmer and occasionally reached boiling point. No major power seriously attempted to mediate the crisis, and some actively participated in keeping it ablaze. Both sides have been actively preparing for the resumption of hostilities, but it is now Armenia that finds itself at a political and military disadvantage.

In the early days of the conflict, Armenia made a strategic decision to align itself with Russia and its interests in the region. That approach paid huge dividends in the early 1990s, with Russia aiding Armenia with military equipment, training, and even direct assistance to ensure that it would emerge victorious in the war with Azerbaijan. This over-reliance on Russia continued to be the main pillar of Armenian foreign policy, culminating in a defense pact between Armenia and Russia. Only a few months ago, the countries held joint military exercises with thousands of troops from both countries involved.

But Russia is never playing with only one deck. Over the last few decades it has become a major supplier of military hardware to Azerbaijan as well as Armenia, and has become a major economic partner of that oil-rich Caspian country. Armenia, when compared to Azerbaijan, is relatively poor. Given the duplicity of Russia’s interests, Yerevan is thus left at a significant disadvantage in this political triangle.

That is not Armenia’s only failure. Another, and perhaps even larger, strategic mistake is the country’s relative isolation on the world stage. This is especially striking given the established and financially successful Armenian diaspora in the West, particularly in France and the US. These communities, which are prosperous and politically influential, have nevertheless failed to articulate Armenia’s security concerns for their respective governments and the general public. In its powerful diaspora, Armenia possesses strategic leverage that only a few small countries can boast, but that advantage has been wasted.

This represents a catastrophic blunder on the part of successive Armenian governments and is a clear indicator of their strategic blindness. Even with Armenia’s recent attempts at warming its relationship with the US and Europe, Western public opinion is unfamiliar with the conflict and not ready to accept the arguments of either side. Armenia’s friendly relationship with Iran does not help its world standing either, but one can argue that in that region countries are not necessarily at liberty to be picky about their friends.

Azerbaijan has oil. It is a country run by a single family, the Aliyevs. It is a Shiite-majority fiefdom run along the lines of the UAE, but with an inept and kleptocratic authoritarian regime. That regime has been on a major arms-buying spree, purchasing arms from Russia and recently from Israel.

On a strategic level, Armenia is in conflict with Turkey, not Azerbaijan. Certain sectors of Turkey, with President Erdoğan as their representative, have never made peace with the fact that they failed to finish off Armenia completely. Turkey’s involvement in this conflict thus contains a pathological aspect.

Erdoğan, with his revanchist imperial strategy, wants to present Turkey as the defender of all Muslim and Turkic people. But in the Caucasus, his ambitions clash with similar imperial sentiments held by Vladimir Putin. This rivalry is as old as both respective empires.

If one is to believe recent reports, Ankara is ramping up its direct involvement in the conflict. It allegedly shot down Armenian SU-25s in Armenian air space and is recruiting and sending Syrian mercenaries to the area in an attempt to replicate the approach it took in Libya.

Everyone is awaiting Russia’s response—but Putin is very careful, and he has apparently calculated that he will not step into this quagmire despite Moscow’s military agreement with Armenia. The conflict, after all, plays into his strategy for the regions surrounding Russia, in what the Kremlin calls the “near far.”

Russia’s goal is to destabilize its neighbors by creating semi-independent states that are quietly stage-managed by Moscow, giving the Kremlin the power to control the political temperature in those countries. Russia may want to sustain the current conflict for a little while for the purpose of weakening Armenia a bit more and then coming in as peacemaker. The end result would render Armenia even more dependent on Russia than it is already.

Russia will not allow Armenia to crush Azerbaijan, as doing so would provoke Turkey to openly enter the conflict—which in turn would force Russia to intervene directly. Sadly, a peaceful resolution to this conflict—if one is even possible—is not currently on the table.

In this scenario, which ways will Russia use to move troops and military equipment to Nagorno-Karabakh? Russia doesn't have a direct border with Armenia. The two land bridges between them are Georgia and Iran through the Caspian Sea. Georgia is hostile towards Russia for as long as I know. And there have been reports that Russia sends some military trucks through Iran. But, on other hand, Iranian officials announced that they support the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. How realistic it is for Russia to transport all the necessary military cargo through the borders of other countries? How do you think, would Iran allow to move tanks, for example, through its territory? Have there been precedents of such large military transit in modern history? Or maybe it's possible to deliver everything through air transport? Just interesting to get your thoughts about that."
6/12/2023,The amount of foreign influence within Iran is concerning (Rant),"Note, this is just my analysis and I would like to know what you think. I'm not saying I won't change my mind on this but this is how I feel.

I am finding it very odd how many IRI officials seem to be very cool and comfortable with Turkey, Baku, Russia. It seems like Iran is promoting their national interests ahead of our own.

Take for instance the 2020 NGK war. The biggest loser of this war was Iran, not Armenia. Prior to this war, Iran had leverage over the turkic states as they would transit from Baku to Nakhcivan through Iranian land. They weren't even charged for this but at least it gave Iran leverage. With Armenia's loss in 2020, Baku gained a new transit link through Armenia and became especially arrogant and scummy towards Iran as they knew that Iran had lost it's leverage. Now they are pressuring Armenia to give them something even more, a middle corridor passing from central asia to caspian sea which would not only give them a transit route but would also make Iran's East-West corridor irrelevant. It would also stop Iran from having a North-South route through Armenia in to Europe because of the borders of Iran and Armenia being cutoff which would mean Iran's travel in to Europe would be dependent on hostile pan-turkic states.

Not getting involved in NGK war was an absolute strategic blunder. Probably one of the worst in Iranian history. While Iran's national interests were on the line, clerics and officials were talking about how ""Karabakh is Islamic land"". They were actively giving a false cover of Islam to a pan-turk agenda that would threaten Iran. During the war, Iran's own Ambassador to Azerbaijan, Afshar Soleymani, was completely shilling for Baku and it was clear as day that this guy was on their payroll. It was also revealed that he had some scandalous affairs over there as well. Many of IRI officials have invested billions in Baku's petro industries. Many other investments of prominent Iranian figures also exist in Baku and Turkey (real estate). On top of that Iranian officials depends on these pan-turkic states for circumventing sanctions. This shameful collusion has resulted in Iranian national interests being sabotaged in favor of these foreign nations. Many have spoken about this panturk lobby as well. There is a clear conflict of interest going around. There's also weird behavior very recently when talking about East Azerbaijan's مس سونگون becoming independent. 

Russia itself also wants the middle corridor because it feels that it can get a route to Europe to circumvent sanctions. Even Aliyev says that Putin is not against this corridor. Speaking of Russia, why is it that Russia and Turkey have benefitted economically from Syria while Iran who spent $15 billion dollars on that conflict has had little to nothing to gain from it. Turkey literally invaded Syria and backed AQ/ISIS and yet they have plenty of of economic benefit. Russia has also carved it's own niche there. Iran has gained absolutely nothing. That is very suspicious.

Then we look at the whole SU-35 thing. Iran has payed a very high economic, sanction, diplomatic, public cost for providing drones that the Russians are using against Ukraine. I'm not necessarily against this but what the hell has Iran gained in return? The Russians won't even give the SU-35s. Meanwhile they had no problems selling S400 to Turkey despite the two countries not being on the same side in Syria even. Our relationship with Russia really doesn't feel mutual. I would like it to be but it doesn't seem that way.

Do you see why I have these concerns? It seems like that Iran's national interests are constantly being sabotaged. I personally don't hate Russia and would like to cooperate them when it comes to have mutual interests but not at the expense of our own. However, I have zero tolerance for pan-turk hostile nations (who steal Iran's culture for themselves) sabotaging our interests. The amount of influence they have within Iran is undeniable. You have pantork professors who spew garbage and filth in front of students and nobody in IRI keeps them in check. You think something like that can happen in turkey or baku? Some of the journalists like Naser Nasseri in Tasmin newspaper writes article completely shilling for the Aliyev family. Meanwhile, Iranian patriots from Tabriz are jailed if they have different political views. Traktor stadium constantly has these pantork cultists who don't even watch football and get paid to come spew garbage. Again, the government does nothing. It really is suspicious because in Baku or Turkey, they would hound people who did similar things but Iran is an open door for infiltration.

Iran busts all these spies/mercs from UK, US, Israel which is great. But how the hell is it that not a single merc/agent from baku has been caught? Why is it that we are always told that we have to puff our chests up with Israel while the turks constantly insult and threaten our nation? I really don't like Israel but one has to really question whether or not this obsession with Israel has been a good idea. The obsession with Israel allowed for Baku to create problems near our border with Israeli assistance. Turkey shakes hands with Israel to harm Iran and yet they still have a better image in the Muslim world than Iran. Many Muslim people are even brainwashed enough to think that it's Turkey which is truly helping the Palestinian cause, not Iran. Polls show that very few Palestinians have a positive view of Iran unfortunately. Iran taking the burden of Israel/Palestine on it's back allowed for Iran's natural enemies to benefit at it's expense. The only way to properly challenge Israel is if every country in MENA contributes it's faire share, not if they go gang up with Israel against Iran. I don't want to ever excuse what Israel does to Palestinians but honestly I really question whether the obsession with Israel ever worth it? Is this even Iran's natural interest or is some foreign entity getting us entangled with them so other powerful nations can thrive at our expense.

The east-west corridor is seeming like it will not pass through Iran since we are sanctioned and constantly have problems near our borders. China evens prefers the middle corridor and one really has to ask was any of this obsession with Israel worth it when hostile anti-Iranian countries like turkey and baku are benefitting at our expense? What's funny is Israel will even benefit from the middle corridor itself. With the current trend/pattern, Iran will do little to convince China. What's funny is that despite all of this, Iran is already getting attacked constantly by Baathists Iraqis and pro-Turkey Afghans on social media for being too nationalist when oddly enough their pan-turk master is the most rabid nationalist in the region and there is good reason to believe that MIT is behind this wave of anti-Iranianism. Turkey dams the Euphrates and Tigris and oddly enough, Iran gets blamed for denying water rights of Iraq. Turkey destroys Syria, back AQ, steals Syrian oil by using ISIS....and Iran gets blamed for it's presence in Syria. They are also mediating with Taliban and Turkey was behind the building of dams in Afghanistan which are now threatening Iran's water. How the hell is that IRI govt pretends like this is a Muslim brother state, it is an absolute hostile entity. Not to mention that Iran doesn't even counteract turkic influence by creating problems for them by riling up Kurds/Alevis and other minorities in turkey.

Simply, the Caucasus

----

Over the past decade, times have been turbulent. With the breakdown of hostilities in Ukraine and the cessation of old territories, it saw a surge of activity within the Caucasus. The Republic of South Ossetia, it's independence now threatened by Russian failures, now was forced to give into the Georgian authorities that were pressing harshly on the border.  In 2021, South Ossetia along with Abkhazia met with Georgian diplomats to finally end their border hostilities and agree, conditionally, to no longer press their independent governments. It ended with Russian Forces withdrawing from the region. Then Georgian President Sofiko Undiladze called for a return of refugees that escaped from the region years ago as ethnic tensions between Abkhazians, Ossetians and Georgians lowered. With a wave of progressive reforms, tens of thousands flocked back to Georgia thanks to President Undiladze's reformations. Meanwhile, a new political party under Alan Alborov, an Ossetian local government official, began to take waves online speaking of a new political party, ""For the People,"" a federal statist and pan-Caucasian political party.

To the South and East, Armenia and Azerbaijan, without Russia acting as a ""big brother,"" were forced to meet their conflicts again. There was little assistance in the region until hostilities began to climb that led to all out war with Armenia and Azerbaijan. While Alan Alborov rose to power in Georgia, his party was exported to the warring countries who fought bitterly over territory that neither had any gains to. Quickly being elected to office in 2022 in Georgia, then Minister Alan Alborov called for a meeting with Armenian and Azeri leaders. He was the first leader to get both parties to sit down at the table since Vladimir Putin and thanks to his tact, he was not only able to press for concessions between both nations that satisfied *mostly* everyone, but was also able to reconcile most differences within the three nations.

Minister Alborov won the Presidential Elections in 2023 at the age of 40. His Party, ""For the People,"" saw immense success in both Azerbaijan and Armenia. It carried over until, in mid-2024, the party saw a majority in all nations and had come together to draft a new constitution for their new state which saw allegories of cooperation from over a century ago... the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. Now, the Caucasus were united under a democratically elected leader and in doing so, formed one of the most bonding governments in the region since the Soviet Union.

Now President Alan Alborov was bordering a Communist Russia. He's working hard to prepare whatever defences are necessary for his nation alongside preparing for the upcoming elections in 2026 that could see a resurgence of Communists. The KPZ, the Communist Party of the Transcaucasus, has been fighting tooth and nail for some ground in the new country. Alborov had to prove that not only was he able to lead this country, but he was able to keep in together.

To his opposition stands a trio of split tickets that are sure to keep the Communists fighting among each other. In 2024, Alborov won with a big-tent pan-union party with the People's Party, the Adequate Party and Law and Justice that saw the creation of the TDFR in all nations, but now they all stand divided once again. Their goals of a greater state were complete, but now, they were going to have to fight one another for power.

* **Datevig Marashian** *Communist Party of Transcaucasia / KPZ*: __Far-Left__ - Marxist-Leninist, Khruschovite-Brezhnevism

Datevig Marashian hails from Armenia and he is a strong supporter of the Soviet Union's era of the 1950's. He hopes to ride on the more progressive minds within the Caucasus to stand behind him in his efforts of reproachment with the Soviet Federative Republic to the North. He hopes to put more funds towards the economy and stand with Moscow in their efforts of international communique with other Soviet Parties. He took the position of General-Secretary of the Party after Minister Lazar Driaev was ousted following the failures of the last election of 2024 and due to his ""failure to denounce the crimes of Joseph Stalin."" Driaev blames most of his failures on the open violence by Sÿmÿdlı.

* **Leyla Sÿmÿdlı** *Communist Party of Transcaucasia (Azeri Region) / KPZ*: __Far-Left__ - Maoism, New Communism, Proletarian internationalism, Russo-Skepticism

Leyla Sÿmÿdlı hails from Azerbaijan and runs the freshly split KPZ. In recent months, due to party disagreements with General Secretary Marashian, Sÿmÿdlı's ""big-tent Communist wing"" fell apart when they had lost the elections just months ago. Blaming the failures on Marashian, she and her party soon discovered that there would be no fraternal communism with revisionists at every corner. She hopes to take the country, and the party, in a Great Leap Forward and create a new communist society based on that of old Cambodia. There are growing concerns of her party's aggression, significantly at rallies of the People's Party in earlier this May wherein members of the Azeri KPZ violently struck several crowd members of the People's Party. It is widely accepted that this hostility had cost the larger ""Communist Future,"" the big tent Communist wing the elections.

Despite this, there are allegations that her party much like the NKPZ were arming up together for a revolution of their own. She has since denied this and insists she intends to have her party elected.

* **Minister Lazar Driaev** *New Communist Party / NKPZ*: __Far-Left__ - Marxist-Leninism, Stalinist, Soviet Patriotism

Minister Lazar Driaev, an Ossetian, is one such man that came from nothing but fought for everything. He hopes to seek approachment with Moscow and is one such leader that is bent on reunification of the Soviet Union, unlike most of his colleagues across the aisle. He stands for everything that the Soviet Union had and hopes to take the country into an authoritarian direction. He was the General Secretary and founder of the Communist Party of Transcaucasia in 2022 and, in an effort to prepare for the 2024 Elections, created a big-tent coalition known as the ""Communist Future"" in hopes to have maximize socialists being elected to power. He had gained some notoriety with Georgian and Ossetian Communists due to his own family history with Stalin, but was ousted just a few months ago for failing to denounce Stalin's crimes and for failing to condemn the violence of Sÿmÿdlı's Maoists in Spring earlier this year.

**The Border Situation**

Many Ossetians within the TDFR are calling for more work to be done to address the North Ossetians while many Caucasians are calling for the Alborov Administration to stand by old territorial commitments. Some are calling for hostilities with their Southern and Western neighbors to take a serious stance on ethnic grounds, pressing the Government to [**hold their Western neighbors**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Soviet_territorial_claims_against_Turkey_1945-1953.png) to old Soviet claims, while others, primarily Azeris, are calling for **[Persian claims to be restored.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Republic_of_mahabad_and_iranian_azerbaijan_1945_1946.png)** Many are asking Alborov for expansionism into Dagestan and Chechnya, in hopes of maintaining a ""true image"" of the Caucasus.

**The Economy**

With a failing healthcare system and a military economy in ruin, President Alborov is in a run-for-his-money! Thanks to new budget cuts and an increase on taxes for the wealthy, he's able to do a little more than the previous leaders had, but has a precarious situation on his hands with fixing the country. He can seek political backing from Law and Justice if he were to put more of a budget towards defence, or he can get more from the People's Party if he were to place the budget towards welfare, justice reform and healthcare. The options are tough for him, but he's got some choices to make!

Many plans were being put into order for what direction Alborov could go into, but all he had to do was march forward."

I always thought of us as in a way cousins, we shared a history together, religion, lots of tradition and overlap with our people.

I mean this is the Caucasus, the peoples in this region have never once hated each other or fought about minor differences ever."

**September 2029 - Serbian Armed Forces Mission to Armenia**

Building on recent developments between Serbia and Armenia, President Aleksic has extended an offer to Armenia to host a joint-military exercise in Armenia. As Armenia has become [a significant importer of Serbian weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/10yh8qz/diplomacy_belgrade_yerevan_visit_2028/), Serbia has a keen interest in warming its security ties with Armenia, and evaluate the performance of its weapons in the field. On the other hand, both Serbia and Armenia are both worried about their precarious positions, being largely surrounded by hostile entities. In the case of Serbia and Armenia, there is a natural kinship in being outgunned by your neighbors, yet persisting. The Serbian Minister of Defense has planned to work with the Armenian Armed Forces in this exercise on a number of matters of keen interest to both states:

* Implementing and counter UAV warfare

* Officer decision-making and unit tactics

With the recent release of Serbia's newest UAV, Serbia has turned a new leaf, taking a close look at the advantages of UAV warfare for smaller states with a strapped budget. Armenia, who suffered a strategic defeat on the battlefield due to UAV warfare, interestingly performed quite well on the ground, and saw greater success in its unit movements due to the experience of its officers. However, it is clear that UAV warfare is needed to counter the same event from repeating again, and in Serbia. Serbia has brought several units of its Utva Pegaz 100, made for longer-duration missions, its earlier smaller variants of Pegaz 011 and 010; and its commercially-procured drones for unit use to see if Armenia and Serbia can replicate the successes of Azerbaijan and Ukraine. Serbia will begin bringing out some of its PASARS-16 short-range anti-air systems to see how they may fair against target drones in a simulated conflict- perhaps Armenia might even be convinced it is the future of its air defense.

It is without question that Armenians, and Serbians alike are fierce fighters, and produce very high-quality troops, high-quality for their location that is. To gain a better understanding of how Armenian troops operate, and to study their unit-level successes, while sharing Serbian knowledge of urban warfare, the exercise will not only be focused on UAVs, but also on the ground. Serbia has planned to deploy about 5,000 troops for two weeks in Armenia, with their invitation to conduct such exercises. Although an exercise, this would be the largest Serbian deployment since the Preševo Valley operations."

10/27/2020,"@NPR: A U.S.-brokered truce — the third attempt by outside powers to end hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region — went into effect on Monday. But almost immediately, the two sides accused each other of violating it. https://t.co/1rrRvfcr4K",
11/11/2020,Another azerbaijani with thoughts (more like incoherent ramble) about the war and Armenia,"\[Please feel free to downvote, but also write in comments your opinion\]  
I feel terribly sorry for all the losses and refugees from both sides both in 2nd and 1st Karabakh war.   
I saw how our refugees suffered many years while country was poor and couldn't support them and it pains me to imagine that thousands of people will have to go through the same suffering in Armenia. I really hope that agreement will hold and they will be able to return to their places as soon as possible.   
I think true winner of current war was Russia. It had a hold on Armenia, now it practically has military presence in Azerbaijan. That puts the region in Russia's hand completely. Taking into account that both Armenia and Azerbaijan are trying to get away from Russia's influence, we both lost in that regard.  
I support idea of Caucasian countries being friends, and partnering in economy, trade, regional projects, tourism etc. We could all benefit from it so much. We could be something like Baltic States. That's a dream, I know and it won't happen for a long time. But I believe that eventually we will come to that.   
Of course, I can imagine how ridiculous it sound for an Armenian right now. There's so much pain and anger, and understandably so. But just think about that. Military defeat is a bad thing, but it usually opens lot of new doors. I am always fascinated with example of Japan after WW2. If you told any Japanese person in early 40-s that Japan will become friends with US and UK, they would laugh at you and call you a traitor. That was unfathomable at that time. But look how prosperous and great they become after becoming friends with their former enemies.  Armenia is in similar situation. There is historical chance to open borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan. To get involved in all the oil, gas pipeline projects, international transit projects, etc. If you think of economic prospective which remains unrealized for Armenia during post-Soviet years, that's billions and billions dollars of mutual income which is not happening because of hostilities over Karabakh.   
In the end, in my mind, final question comes to   
""Is it more important to provide people with better happier life or to have some lines on the map that you like?"".   
When I look at this question, answer is obvious. But majority of population from both Armenian and Azerbaijani side choose second option. In such times needs to be some political will which is going against people's opinion. It's easy to do in Azerbaijan, because it's dictatorship. Aliyev will say Armenians are friends now, and everyone will have to accept it. But it's harder to do from Armenian side.   
That's why I hope that there won't be a coup in Armenia bringing more nationalistic and pro-russian people to power. I hope that we can really become friends against Russia's will. I watch Russian tv shows and get blown away by the level of chauvinism in that country's political thinking. They say openly that this outcome is good because Russia can now influence both sides and keep them from getting closer to each other.   
In my mind, we are not enemies to each other. We have a common enemy.   
Please write your thoughts. I'm really interested if there're any people on the other side that agree with me."

8/2/2023,What are Georgian-Turkish relations like?,"Westerner here, I think I have a decent grasp on turkish affairs, surface level knowledge about post-soviet Georgia and none about the rest of its history. 

If Im not mistaken, Turkey and Georgia already have a productive relationship but theres more to the question. I imagine deep relations are unquestionably good for Georgia, as Turkey and Russia have conflicting interests in Syria, Libya, Armenia-Azerbaijan and now Ukraine and georgians are probably looking to see their country safe and severed from Russia.

But also Im thinking that Erdogans flirts with Russia strain his image in Georgia, even if, as I assume, this was just posturing to get concessions from western countries and Turkeys position on Russia is nonetheless unconditionally that of a rival.
Additionally, how do Georgians stand on the Armenian-Azeri conflict, and does that influence relations with Turkey?


Lastly Im interested how receptive georgians at large are towards turkish people, say a group of turks walks in Tbilisi or wherever, is there open hostility towards them? A cloud of distrust, some sort of curiosity, friendliness or  something else?"
3/22/2022,Terms for the Cessation of the Use of Force Against Trebizond and its Allies,"The Sublime Ottoman State and the Republic of Armenia, as peace-loving nations, greatly desire an end to the war with Trebizond and a restoration of peace in Anatolia and beyond. However, as Trebizond and its allies have so recently engaged in the vile perfidy of negotiating and ostensibly agreeing to a peace treaty only to flagrantly and immediately violate its terms, we cannot trust that Trebizond and its allies are capable of negotiating in good faith nor keeping their word. Therefore, we cannot justify spending the time nor the effort on negotiating a new treaty, nor can we allow Trebizond and its allies to retain territories in Anatolia from which they could so easily use as a base from which to strike or scheme against us and our people. Thusly, the Sublime Ottoman State and the Republic of Armenia offer these terms, upon the realization of which the Sublime Ottoman State and the Republic of Armenia will consider the conflict resolved and cease all offensive and hostile actions against Trebizond and its allies:

* Trebizond, Genoa, and the Golden Horde cease all military action and other offensive and hostile actions, including financing, supporting, supplying, condoning, or aiding the offensive and hostile actions of others, against the Sublime Ottoman State and the Republic of Armenia.
* Trebizond, Genoa, and the Golden Horde, inclusive to any vassals, protectorates, clients, and puppets thereof, renounce all ownership of, control over, and claims to cities and lands in Anatolia, and withdraw from all cities and lands in Anatolia they currently exercise control over.
* Trebizond, Genoa, and the Golden Horde recognize the Sublime Ottoman State's lawful claim to and ownership of cities of Manastir, Planatos, Pocca, Kotoyra, Satala, Dipotamos, Cerasus, and Bosporos and their respective surrounding lands, and cede effective control over those cities and lands to the Sublime Ottoman State.
* Trebizond, Genoa, and the Golden Horde recognize the Republic of Armenia's lawful claim to and ownership of cities of Oinoa, Rizunda, and Trebizond and their respective surrounding lands, and cede effective control over those cities and lands to the Republic of Armenia.
* These terms are reached in good faith and with reasonable interpretations thereof, and there is no attempt to evade, circumvent, or otherwise act in bad faith or fail to uphold the plain meaning and intent of the terms or the peace process more generally."

Before WW2, the Soviets had spent the 20s and early 30s invading and subjugating neighbors. After Lenin's death, Trotsky was meant to be his replacement. One of the central tenants of Trotskyism (which Stalin had a problem with) was the idea of permanent revolution and the need for the USSR to be constantly exporting/instigating revolutions all over the world especially in Western capitalist countries. Of course no Western country, especially Poland, was going to form a trustworthy alliance with a massive hostile industrialized neighbor THAT NEARLY CONQUERED POLAND 18 years before and would've continued westward if not for the Miracle of Vistula. The USSR wasn't some feeble, small agrarian society fighting for its existence before WW2. The Red Army was fully reformed by 1929 (and was first used in the Sino-Soviet War). The reason Germany invaded in the summer of 1941 was because the high command knew they weren't getting a better chance because of how badly the Red Army performed in Finland. It's arguably the biggest historical effect the Winter War had in subsequent history.

3) Azerbaijani hostility toward Armenians in the late 1980s and early 1990s was not based on an Azerbaijani claim to Nagorno Karabagh, but, rather, was the outlet for growing domestic Azerbaijani frustrations over political, economic and demographic shifts that increased the gap in living standards between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

* A 1990 CIA chronology of Nagorno Karabagh, prepared in August of 1990, included the following entry: “1921-23: New Soviet Government makes Nagorno Karabakh – historically an Armenian area—an autonomous region within the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.”

* A CIA 1988 study on the Caucasus confirms the historical record of Nagorno Karabagh’s status as “Armenia’s cultural and religious center.” The study specifically noted that, “Karabakh through the centuries remained semiautonomous under the rule of Armenian princes even when the rest of Armenia was under Persian and Turkish tutelage.”

* The same 1988 study, reports that, “Azeri animosity toward the Armenians has been intensified by political, economic, and demographic trends that have adversely affected the political status of Azeris and increased the gap in living standards between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In particular, the rapid expansion of Azerbaijan’s young adult population has put enormous strains on the republic’s capacity to provide adequate jobs, housing, and education. Azeri frustration has found an outlet in attacks on Armenians.”

* A 1978 CIA report on Soviet minorities issues, notes that, “the inhabitants of another turbulent area in the Caucasus, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, are able to make a better argument that their oblast should be transferred from one republic to another. The Karabakh Oblast is part of Azerbaydzhan, yet over 80 percent of its population is Armenian and it lies close to the border of the Armenian Republic. In 1975, according to the Azerbaydzhan Republic newspaper, virtually the entire leadership of the Karabakh Oblast was ousted for supporting a movement to detach the oblast from Azerbaydzhan and join it to Armenia.”

2/3/2023,"The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention issued another ""Red Flag Alert"" for genocide on Azerbaijan"," [https://www.lemkininstitute.com/red-flag-alerts-1/red-flag-alert-for-genocide---azerbaijan-update-6](https://www.lemkininstitute.com/red-flag-alerts-1/red-flag-alert-for-genocide---azerbaijan-update-6)

>On  the 53rd day of the criminal blockade of the Lachin corridor by Azeri  pseudo-environmentalists, the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention  is issuing a new Red Flag Alert for Genocide for Azerbaijan. The  blockade of this corridor, the only land route connecting the Armenians  of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) with Armenia proper, has caused a  humanitarian crisis with the isolation of 120,000 people, including over  30,000 children, 20,000 elderly people, and 9,000 people with  disabilities. Armenians in Artsakh are running low on food, essential  medicines (such as insulin), baby formula, essential female hygiene  products, and other necessities. The serious humanitarian crisis caused  by the blockade worsens daily with constant gas, electricity, and  internet cuts by Azerbaijan in the middle of the harsh Caucasian winter.  The responsibility for this humanitarian crisis lies solely with the  Azerbaijani state and particularly with the regime of President Ilham  Aliyev.  
>  
>The  Lemkin Institute has repeatedly warned that this blockade is part of  the broader genocidal aims of the Azeri leadership, supported by its  staunch ally Turkey, as well as a continuation of genocidal acts carried  out by the Baku regime against the Armenian community. The blockade is,  therefore, not an isolated act but one occurring in the context of a  war, at times latent, that Azerbaijan unilaterally began in September  2020 and that has as its aim the takeover of historic Armenian lands in  the Republic of Artsakh and in the Republic of Armenia along with the  forced displacement (“ethnic cleansing”) of the Armenian populations in  Azeri-acquired territory. The Lemkin Institute takes the position that  such aims are genocidal in that they seek to permanently destroy the  Armenian identity in these regions.   
  
>  
>The 2020 war, far from being  over, has only deepened in the past year with Azeri attacks on Armenia  and further land occupation – including 140km of the sovereign territory  of the Republic of Armenia. In September 2022 Azerbaijan once again  breached the Tripartite Agreement that ended the 44-Day War in 2020 by  launching an aggressive war against the Republic of Armenia, during  which Armenian POWs were once again tortured, humiliated, and massacred.  Statements made by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and by Turkish  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have confirmed fears that Azeri land  claims will not end with the territory of Artsakh, which is over 99  percent Armenian and has been inhabited by a majority of Armenians for  thousands of years. Observers should expect any genocide against  Armenians in Artsakh to be accompanied or followed by aggressions  against Armenia proper, particularly the southern Syunik region where  Azerbaijan and Turkey would like to build a “Zangezur corridor” linking  the two countries and excluding Armenians. This corridor would cut  Armenia off from its southern border, further weakening its geopolitical  position and rendering it even more vulnerable to attacks from its  hostile neighbors.  
  
>  
>In recent days, various media outlets have  suggested that Azerbaijan is using the blockade as a psychological tool  in order to gradually but steadily expel Armenians from Artsakh by  making life impossible for them. This would not surprise us at the  Lemkin Institute. The so-called “environmentalists” who have blocked the  Lachin corridor have shown themselves to be little interested in  environmentalism. They chant “Karabakh is Azerbaijan” and carry signs  supporting Aliyev and the Azerbaijani military. Human rights  organizations have linked many of them with the Azerbaijani government  and the Azerbaijani military, and several protesters have flashed the  sign of the terrorist, anti-Armenian Grey Wolves organization. This is  all a far cry  from what one would see at an environmental protest;  rather, this behavior is aligned with official Azerbaijani policies of  denying the indigeneity of the Armenians of Artsakh, of destroying the  Armenian cultural heritage in the South Caucasus, and of repeatedly  threatening the expulsion of the Armenians from the entire region, even  from Armenia proper, because the territory should belong to Azerbaijan.  
  
>  
>The  Lemkin Institute is also highly concerned about the global implications  of Azerbaijan’s anti-Armenian policies and rhetoric, which are promoted  worldwide with complete impunity. For example, anti-Armenian flyers  were posted on the morning of 29 January 2023 around an area of Los  Angeles, California where the Armenian diaspora was planning a  demonstration against the blockade of Artsakh. The text of the flyers  called for genocide, reading: ""Azerbaijan + Turkey + Pakistan + Israel =  4 BROTHERS WILL WIPE Armenia OFF the MAP Inshallah!!!!"" The flyers used  religious symbols next to each country in order to give the call for  genocide an anti-Christian character. In addition to calling for  genocide, the religious symbology included in the flyers denotes an  attempt to change the nature of a primarily territorial conflict into a  civilizational one. These flyers are now being shared and celebrated on  Azeri social media, just as videos of atrocity crimes against Armenians  in the wars of 2020 and 2022 were similarly disseminated. Hate speech of  this type must be investigated and not ignored by local and national   authorities.  
  
>  
>Although the Lemkin Institute welcomes the European  Parliament Resolution of 19 January 2023 that requests that Azerbaijan  immediately end the blockade, this resolution is not enough if it is not  accompanied by concrete measures to put an end to the criminal behavior  of the regime of Ilham Aliyev as reflected by the blockade and in other  acts, such as the war of aggression in 2022, the permanent violations  of the human rights of the Armenian inhabitants of Artsakh, the  destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, the atrocity crimes committed  by Azeri soldiers against Armenian civilians and POWs, and the hate  speech and ideology the Azerbaijani state encourages in its population  from an early age on.  
  
>  
>Because of the continuing lack of concrete  action by any state or multilateral institution, we call on the European  Parliament, the international community represented in the United  Nations, NATO, and the different states of the world committed to peace  and security, to intervene forcefully and diplomatically in this  conflict in order to build peace in the region and protect the Armenian  identity from a second genocide. Azerbaijan and Turkey should be  economically and diplomatically sanctioned and isolated if they do not  immediately and publicly pull back from their belligerent threats  against Armenia and Armenians, their sponsoring of terrorism, their  continued genocide denial, and their fanning of the flames of hate in  the region. Perhaps most importantly, states such as Israel, the USA,  and Ukraine, each of which claims to support democracies, must  immediately cease all military and economic support for the dictatorship  in Azerbaijan. By granting Azerbaijan abundant military support, these  states are tipping the scales forcefully against Armenia and could be  complicit in genocide. The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention  takes complicity very seriously and will pursue any legal case that  proposes itself should the world turn a blind eye to the plight of the  Armenian people and oversee another genocide against them – this one  wholly preventable.   
  
>  
>The stakes are high not only for Armenians  the world over, but also for the future of democracy, regional and  global security, and the principle of multilateralism. Neither the  United Nations nor its member states can ignore the principles that were  established back in 1945 to forge an egalitarian and peaceful  international community: equal sovereignty, the right to  self-determination, and territorial integrity. Failure to comply with  any of these principles defeats the core purposes for which the UN was  created, and therefore their breach should result in immediate sanctions  and further actions to cease hostilities and protect the lives and  human rights of all individuals and groups equally."
2/22/2021,"Second Nagorno Karabakh war and its political implications: The Rise of the Osmans, and Bear's humiliation","With the current Caucasian sphere slowing down and becoming more stable, it is now acceptable for me to give out my analysis of the geopolitical proxy war that was the second Karabakh war, and its implications geopolitically. 

We will chronologically rank every country that had won the most in this war. Enjoy the wall of text. 

**Azerbaijan**

The war went extremely favorably from not just the military front, but also geopolitical. Prior to the second war, Aliyev and Azerbaijan was doing horribly and was being embarrassed by Armenia and its military that even Killdim would have blushed. 

But everything changed after the November 9 agreements, giving Azerbaijan 4 remaining whole rayons without a fight, and getting Matghis in their territory despite not being under their control, Azerbaijan got the emperor's share in this war and was practically being showered in victories for themselves. 

However, despite what people think, the Azerbaijani military itself did horrendously in this war due to their poor preparation, and was deeply reliant on Turkish advisors for proper military support, but it was Aliyev that had all the victories by the end.

Aliyev's regime was never doing well prior to the war, it was economically stagnant and has not recovered from the 2014 economic downturn in oil despite being 6 years after it. Aliyev's regime is very weak after the Armenian velvet revolution happened as it was encouraging the people to revolt against them, meanwhile their military did horribly in the July battles against Armenia, furthermore, this embarrassment continued with the late September battles where the Armenian military pretty much crippled the entire attack force of Azerbaijan in just 5 days (although we lost a lot of guys too from those battles). 

Postwar, Aliyev has won many medals and much honor from his population, every mistake he has done has pardoned him with all of his crimes and corruption, he won, and he got 7 rayons, Shushi and Hadrut all at the same time (without Armenians ofcourse!) Not just that, but Azerbaijan can now peacefully threaten Kapan, Goris and many Armenians in Syunik and humiliate their weaker rival in the most satisfying way possible. They can take the Sotk goldmine and intimidate the Armenians with their superior military and superior equipment, while the Armenian government is in disarray, embarrassing itself by awkwardly doing totalitarian moves by recently arresting some of their opponents, while My step's members are leaving by the dozens. And yes, Armenia is suffering the further loss of the Hin Tagher areas and suffering brutal massacres of their military under the Azerbaijani army.

The world has seen Aliyev and Azerbaijan's might, and they are impressed by their miracle drone tactics and their total victory against their old opponent by killing 4000 of their soldiers. 

**Future**

Ilham Aliyev's rule has pretty much been assured for the next 8-10 years, while the first fives years will have nothing but praise, the last five years will be all but turmoil from all three sides, military, economic and political. 

Our favorite Aliyev puppet and leader and head of Caspian Report SeaSnakeX had made a great quote 

*It is easier to tear a country down than it is to rebuild one.*

And indeed this is the problem that Ilham Aliyev has pulled himself into, he has mainly three problems to deal with and, realistically only one can be dealt with.

Internally, speaking there are three more problems that are going to take 4 Russian loans to fix just for one to be even remotely be considered fixed. The first and easiest will be military, this is not a large problem, but a significant number of LAV's, tanks and AFV as well as the special forces core has been completely wiped clean from the earth. Not a big issue, but with dwindling money, fixing this problem will be valuable in the long run, but not beneficial for the main problems for Azerbaijan that they are currently suffering from.

The two remaining problems will be the biggest undertaking Azerbaijan can ever do to just complete one of them.

The seven Rayons are a great victory, but a great expense for Azerbaijan to rebuild themselves, realistically, Azerbaijan will need to spend up to 3 billion dollars to just get these Rayons into a functional area, and that is not accounting for the absolute shit-storm tier military problems they are facing in Kelbajar. People think Syunik and Artsakh are a security problem, but really, it is Kelbajar that is going to be the most vulnerable area in the whole of Caucasia, that place needs to house at least 80,000 people alone, and have decent quality of living, and have decent military on top of that, and that is still counting housing another 520,000 refugees from the 7 rayons that need security, jobs and proper governance. 

The 7 Rayons are a big problem, but when your economy is so dysfunctional it makes the Armenian economy in the 90's looks good. Azerbaijan with its heavy oil reliance has led to complete economic failure for Azerbaijan. Aliyev's economic policy of just relying on oil prices has left Azerbaijan into a banana republic, diversification plans have utterly failed to even remotely give proper growth and 90% of their export revenue is still under oil. Even if Azerbaijan had a competent economic team (which they barely do) it would take ***years*** for Azerbaijan to get out of its oil dependency. For some perspective, both Armenia and Georgia, *after 25 fucking years*, have  50-70% of their economy be related to either mining or agriculture, and most of their industry is heavily support by agriculture and imports, and these economies are vastly better and more developed, and what Azerbaijan is aiming for these 10 years to get to. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's agricultural muscle (its historical advantage) represents only 3% at best in its export base, all of it is going to Russia.

While oil prices are suspected to increase and peak in the 2040's, they will all exclusively be in the developing third world (Africa and India), most nations like China, and Europe are heading towards alternative energy, this is where Azerbaijan exports the most, further making the Azerbaijani economy even more screwed than it already is. Mind you, Azerbaijan will not be the only one in this situation, Saudi Arabia is even more screwed over. 

The question is *if* Azerbaijan collapses economically, ***it's when***. I can't predict that unfortunately, best case scenario is a great depression, worst case, 90% of what Venezuela is suffering right now in 7 years. 

Do you think problems like these are near crisis level? We are not even getting into the nation's internal and geopolitical problems yet.

The real issue for Aliyev is hereditary, who is going to succeed him? Emil Samanyan suggested his wife Mehraba Aliyeva, but Azerbaijan is as macho and male dominated as Armenian leadership is right now, so if she is the leader of Azerbaijan, she will be a short regent, no one wants a fucking Tik-toker run Azerbaijan with plastic surgeons on her everyday. The real successor to Azerbaijan will be Heydar Aliyev (not the one who died in 2003) We know very little of Heydar, the kid is barely older than me by 2 years, and he does not look fit for a leader currently, but in 10 years, maybe. This is the same kid who bought a shit load of mansions at age 14 in 2012 by the way. The problem with Heydar is that when he does take power in 10 years when his father steps down due to his unpopularity, he will be a in a world with a hostile Azerbaijani population, with less experience and a much worse position his father was in 2003 than he was, the geopolitical atmosphere will have changed vastly, and much less to Azerbaijan's favour in the future.  

Geopolitically, Azerbaijan is as isolated and alone as Armenia and Georgia is, the West doesn't care about them, and the rest of the planet barely acknowledge that each one exists, the West is a no go anymore. This leads to Azerbaijan's real ally to be its recent Turkish alliance. Turkey will be a good and bad thing, the good thing is all of the given things that Azerbaijan has problems with can be resolved by 10 Turkish loans each. The problem with that is Turkey will demand more political control in Azerbaijan, furthermore, any point of Turkish influence will always be met by Russian hostilities as they will see Azerbaijan as another Georgia, a traitor and a puppet. Iran will be even more hostile to Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani relations are even worse with Iran currently than they have ever been with the recent changes of the geopolitical front. 

**This is the price of victory.**

&#x200B;

**Russia**

The mighty Russian, once seen as the power of the Caucasus has been shaken by the Osmans Turks.

Russia did very poorly in this war, their perceived inactivity in the eyes of their allies (Armenia) was not a good image, but there is far more to this than what meets the eye.

Russian policy was to keep the balance of power in the Caucasus, Russia enjoyed the status quo because they were the mediators and jockeys of the conflict, they were very wary of Azerbaijan, but as long as they satisfied them with favorable promises such as returning the 7 rayons, it would have been enough. Unfortunately, Russia's power has been waning for decades. Georgia and Moldova were the first traitors to abandon Russia, and were punished as a result of their disloyalty. Russia further became weary as its Central Asian subjects began shifting into their own interests and not in Russia with Uzbekistan being an example and Turkimenistan, a growing disloyal power, and Tajikistan and Kyrgistan, becoming a sphere in China rather than Russia. This left Russia even more xenophobic and feared more of its own allies were beginning to desert them.

At the same time, Russia knew very well that Azerbaijan's recent military investment in the late 2000's and early 2010's were alarming as the balance of power shifted towards Azerbaijan.

Russia began a program of financing the Armenian military by giving Armenia 3 loans and a military arms deal, with a military discount on top, this puts the amount of military investment the Russians gave to the Armenians were close to **1.5 billion dollars from 2014-present.** Russia is still continuing to invest in Armenia as they know they are a *""Loyal""* ally so far.  

But remember when I said how weary Russia had become? **Russia could not trust Armenia to hold the balance of power**, Russia's heavy handed tactics of hard power was not effective and the geopolitical front in the Caucasus will be met with hostilities with **Turkey** Russia feared that if a resolution could arrive, it would make Armenia leave Russia's sphere of influence, ending Russian supremacy in the Caucasus altogether. Therefore, Russian policy changed to the Madrid principles. This change in stance was clear by 2016 when Serzh Sargsyan began realizing that Russia would no longer be willing to help Armenia in the Artsakh war, keeping a mediating stance to the war (despite Russia losing power as a result). Russia still favored Armenia mind you, ***but they wanted themselves in control***. 

The war caught the Russians off guard. The Turks were in Azerbaijan and they no longer had power in Azerbaijan, this was a disaster. Not just the Russians could not make a military response, but also had no capable way of defeating the powerful Tb2's effectively. This left Russia in a humiliating and embarrassing stance in the war, they essentially wrote the Lavrov plan to give a compromise to Azerbaijan so that they can remove the Azerbaijanis from the Turkey's grasps. 

What makes it ever more humiliating for Russia is that most of the military tech Armenia had, was all from Russia and made by Russia. **All of it was destroyed from a couple of Turkish drones. These weren't 60's weaponry, they were 90's-2000's systems built to fight some powerful tech.**

**After pressuring Armenia to do the Lavrov plan, they had gained, basically half of Artsakh, and turning Armenia into a complete dependency to Russia.** 

The Lavrov plan was very insidious, it gave legal precedence for Russian occupation of Artsakh and complete control of it, and expunged Turkey from even remotely being part of it. Russia basically pulled the rug on Turkey by making their own *""brothers""* betray them by signing the Lavrov plan, screwing them over. 

**Future**

This is a Russian victory, no doubt, Russia had tricked the Osmans and made their Azerbaijani puppets be on their side temporarily, however, Russia is not going to be masterful planer as we think, nor are they this malevolent deity that can dominate the Caucasus, take nothing but cowardice for their act of treachery for leaving their only loyal ally for dead in this war.

Russia has no power over Armenia, but they have power over Artsakh, and that is enough to keep the Armenians in their sphere for decades. Decades, will not be this status quo unfortunately.

**Russia is growing weaker by the day, and this war only made them breath a little longer.**

Russia's diplomatic failure and heavy reliance of hardpower has led to them to total diplomatic collapse of all of their allies. Russia needs to understand that they are not the USSR anymore, they are a pathetic power that had just thrown their own ally to the ground and ran away from their own backyard being pillaged by an idiot from Ankara, and yet, all they do is throw territory for appeaset to Azerbaijan? Appeasement only shows you can't fight.

**Russia knows this, they don't like it.** 

Russia has tried to make the Armenians happy by trying to take some territory in Shushi to make Azerbaijani habitability in Shushi impossible, but also open the border for Armenia to benefit from it. All of this is purely the benefit of Armenia, Azerbaijan has no reason not to trade with their sworn enemy. 

As an Armenian myself to any Russian lurker here, let me tell you this how we feel.

**Do you think a patch of land, and opening the borders are going to make us not betray you after the Karabakh conflict is resolved because of your cowardice in this war? The Armenians no longer want to be part of Russia anymore, they despise them and find them unreliable and cowardly. They are now a disloyal ally only there for Artsakh, they will not stop any minute until Artsakh is under their rule no matter what.**

Russia knows this to, that's why they are keeping Artsakh hostage. They want bloodthirsty revenge to the Turks, and particularly, Azerbaijan for humiliating them, and making them do what they did to their only bastion of Russian influence (Armenia). 

Russia will not threaten Armenia, it's too risky, removing and installing Kocharyan will spell the end of Russian influence as the Armenian population is outright hostile to Russia right now. As for Azerbaijan, you may as well consider the 5 year occupation as a deadline for Azerbaijan, if Azerbaijan continues in its direction with Turkey by the end of 2025, Russia will become a threat to Azerbaijan. 

**There will be a war, it will be started by Russia or Azerbaijan, it depends on who is pathetic enough to do it.**  

&#x200B;

**Georgia**

Georgia got nothing and lost nothing in this war, but it is now in the worst geopolitical position in the Caucasus, even worse than Armenia. 

Georgia dreamt of being on the side of the West, but the West doesn't care about Georgia, this left Georgia as a defenseless nation with no response to Russian aggression in the Caucasus. Georgia's only real allies in the Caucasus are Armenia and Azerbaijan, they are brothers to them, but when their brothers are killing each other and joining the enemies that Georgia is trying to keep away from is difficult to impossible.

Georgia tried to keep a neutral ground, but was quickly intimidated by Turkey to be loyal to them, Georgia did nothing, Georgia can do nothing in this conflict.

**Future**

Georgia is the most isolated country of the three Caucasian states, Georgia has, realistically, two options, one is drinking two cups of lava, and the other is getting shot four times. 

The first option is drinking lava, negotiating with Russia will be a humiliating deal for the Georgians, they gave them ruin, and all they're doing is sucking up to the Russians, angering Turkey and becoming a Russian puppet with no policy of its own. Russia will oppress the Georgian people, but not kill the democratic government. Hey, at least you got Abkhazia and South Ossetia back! 

The second option is getting gun downed basically, but Georgia can survive as long as it finds a way to stop the bleeding from Russian and Turkish wounds. Joining the newly forming Turkish Hegemony is not a bad idea, but it's the least bad option Georgia finds itself in, this will always make Russia become a threat no matter what and make Georgia, basically become a dependency for Turkish defense against Russian aggression. The Turks are a danger to Georgia, take no doubt, but it's better than being a puppet to the Russians.

**Georgia must pick a side**

And it literally will be the Switzerland of the Caucasus, this country is flawless in domestic and internal manners, Democracy is great baby.

&#x200B;

**Iran**

Iran is the sleeping giant in this conflict, it is the ""Third option"" or the ""Wild Card"" Iran is the Shia power that is slowly turning into a hegemon of its own, although its economy has done poorly as a result of the US, Iran is a beast that not even the Turks can take on alone without sacrificing an arm and a leg. 

For some truth, Iran has always favoured the Armenians over the Azerbaijanis, Iran sees Azerbaijan (especially right now) as nothing but a Turkish wannabe and a puppet of Turkey against Iranian interest. 

Therefore, the war came at a complete surprise to Iran as it did to Russia when they realised it was orchestrated by the Turks. **The Iranians were always in a hands-off attitude to the conflict as long as there was no large scale war, and as long as Russia kept Turkey out of the Caucasus.**

Well then, things have changed for the worse. Geopolitically, Iran see's Azerbaijan as a complete security threat to themselves, and Turkey is the main opponent, with Russia potentially making an exit from the conflict or from the horizon entirely, and being humiliated by the Turkish army is an extremely alarming sign for Iran, as Turkey is essentially becoming the next Sunni power that they must defeat or try limiting its influence. 

Iran is currently cooking up a plan probably to know what they are trying to do in the Caucasus and what type of investments can they make, their main role will be trying to limit the growing Turkish influence happening in Syria, Iraq, Israel, Egypt and now Azerbaijan, all of it choking Iran's western empire. 

**Future**

Muhammed Javad Zariff is an excellent diplomat, but his statements and opinions towards Armenia and Azerbaijan represent an excellent view on what Iran thinks.

""We are happy for the liberated territories""

Iran has consistently always demanded that the Armenians withdraw from the 7 rayons, and here, Iran is happy to see the 600,000 people (100,000 are from Armenia and they will never get their homes back.) get their homes back. Unfortunately, it is the only agreement both the Azerbaijanis and Iranians can agree on.

""Armenia's territorial integrity is the red line to Iran""

As a young analyst, ***this was by far the most aggressive Iran has ever been in the Caucasus***, this statement proves that Iran is extremely unhappy of the changes of the Status-quo, and fear Turkish dominance in the Caucasus with Azerbaijan as its fortress. Iran therefore, will put in great priority to arm and protect Armenia from any type of aggression from Turkey or Azerbaijan, ***Artsakh included*****. They want status from Artsakh, and not an autonomous republic in Azerbaijan.** 

*Iran will not be an ally of Russia, Russia won't be an ally of Iran, but both will have similar interests of keeping Turkish influence out of the Caucasus, with the help of the Armenians. Interests are priority, not idealism.*

**Iran will become a very large player in the future of the third war, they will be on the Armenian side, not Russian.** 

&#x200B;

**Turkey**

*The Osman terror*. Let me be very honest with you, **Turkey was the one responsible for the second Karabakh war, nothing is even remotely proving that Turkey was not the reason why Aliyev got so cocky in this war.** 

Turkey is the mastermind of this war, and was the military victor of this war, they had not just crushed the pathetic Armenians, but also humiliated the Russians on the geopolitical front, the Russian went flying and cowering in fear when TB2's began to dominate the skies of Artsakh, under the Turkish flag the Azerbaijanis walked in victory. The flags, mercenaries, drones and commandos, all came from Turkey themselves, they are the masterminds of this war after all.

So why did Turkey do it? 

Ultranationalism..... ^(and they got nothing out of it.) 

*Turkish leadership currently seems to be extremely competent at running Turkey into the ground.* 

I cannot fucking imagine what on earth was the megalomaniac decisions of Erdogan is at throwing Turkey into basically three fucking fronts, and losing all three of them at the same time, and, somehow, pissing off Russia, France, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Balkans and making the USA and EU more hostile. Seriously, Erdogan is the worst leader in the Caucasian front and has completely drowned himself in Turanistic Neo-Ottoman delusions, fascists and near Hitlerian levels of racism. 

If one can literally see the timeline of Turkey, Turkey literally did what Germany did before WW2 in just 8 fucking months. 

Original Turkish policy was to never get itself involved against stronger or equal powers, the Caucasus is essentially an arena of Iran and Russia, all that don't like Turkey. Not just that, but Turkey's main objective was to extend its influence in the Balkans and the Middle east, which itself is very challenging as the nation faces equally powerful foes such as Egypt.

Hilariously, Mr. Erdogan decided to throw all of that away, and pretty much go the same way Germany did in 1938, and decide to be militarily aggressive by joining in more proxy wars and break their heads into territory they have rarely found themselves into. Turkey is a powerhouse, but Turkey cannot fight 4 other regional superpowers at once, and therefore, becomes an easy scapegoat and a boogeyman for all.

**As for the karabakh war, do you know what they got at the end after spending what could be 200 million dollars? A fucking joint Russian-Turkish monitoring base in a city that won't be function in maybe five years? (Agdam) Erdogan is the real clown here.**

**Future**

The Turks need to re-analyze how to properly handle their newly owned subjects like Georgia, Azerbaijan and Israel currently, being an idealistic moron and believing in brotherly turanism is going make Turkey look like Nazi Germany, which would give an easy casus bellie for every nation that wants Turkey gone. 

Turkey will still get Azerbaijan, however, being charitable is and should not be an option, donate when Azerbaijan is willing to give more concessions than it is worth, and always keep Turkish interests at heart, just because Azerbaijan is your *""brother""* doesn't mean excluding them from the rest of your dependencies, because your Turkic brother just threw you under the Lavrov plan bus and you got nothing out of it, do not be too feeble next time to be tricked again ffs. 

Overall, Turkey will continue to become a growing power in the Caucasus, their dependencies of Georgia and Azerbaijan leave only one little Caucasian state left, it is Armenia. 

Turkey has much reason to negotiate and make a few concessions, because if they can make a few concessions like allowing Armenia to have Artsakh, and recognize the Armenian Genocide, it will give an insane amount of power in the Caucasus, ***essentially becoming the new Turkish Backyard.*** Turkey is a powerful foe for Armenia, but Turkey see's Armenia as the last opponent to bring into their empire, and once they do, **the Russians will be defenseless.** 

&#x200B;

**Turkey has much to conquer and much to dominate, but a leadership change and a change in mentality to follow world standards will make Turkey become a superpower if they do it.**

&#x200B;

**Armenia**

Armenia, the big fat loser of this war, we got all of it. We lost Artsakh as a result of the Lavrov plan, Azerbaijanis humiliated us in Syunik, and currently protests are happening on a daily basis by the 17 parties (RoboSerzh), the oligarchs smell blood, and the Armenians are bleeding from every orifice that is being created everyday. 

It doesn't stop there, the economic situation of Armenia has deteriorated as a result of 30-40,000 Armenian refugees from Artsakh, meanwhile, the Covid-19 epeidemic has killed 4000 people and has infected another 160,000 people, poor policy is a result. The country is in chaos and is sombering as their defeat from an overwhelming Turkish backed Azerbaijani force has crushed them.

Their armies buried, their allies betrayed them. The only thing that is even remotely positive for Armenia is that it isn't falling into a Syrian civil war and be invaded by aliens, hell has come and the world collapsed under Armenia. It seems pretty bleak.

**Future**

The future looks about the same as what we had before the war...

Do you think anything for Armenia has changed? **Russia doesn't want Pashinyan gone why would they?** Kocharyan and the 17 parties will utterly fail because half the population already supports Pashinyan, and 2/3rds of Armenia see the 17 parties as nothing but incompetent and corrupt fools. People don't want Pashinyan, but 100% don't want Roboserzh to be back, and that pretty much leaves Armenian democracy in a gray zone of uncertainty. 

The Armenians really haven't had a problem with economic reform and good governance ever since Serzh Sargsyan came to power.

Serzh Sargsyan, while a corrupt leader no doubt, he pretty much pulled Armenia from a thug infested dumpster fire, to an emerging economy, his excellent decision making made Armenia go above and beyond the horizon and put Armenia on the road to developing industry, AI, IT, and giving Armenia some nice drones of his own. Pashinyan came to power, changed nothing and dialed anti-corruption by 900% and gave Armenia a booming prosperous economy by 2019, our economy before the epidemic was 10% year-on-year.

The future internally looks bright for Armenia, the nation will develop its excellent industry and will most likely end up just like Georgia in 5 years, in 10 years. Despite all the doom and gloom, Armenia and Georgia will be centres of excellence in the Caucasus, and we will see this in the future. 

There are however, two real issues Armenia has to resolve.

The first issue are the elections in 2024.

The delay is excellent because it gives more time for a proper and new opposition to rise up, and potentially replace My Step (My step won't go away, just become a powerful opposition party). There is a big problem for this, as Eric hacopian has said, we are all fine with who participates in the government, **as long as the previous government isn't in power or has connections. We really don't want these idiots in power, they put Armenia in this position and made us weaker in the long run.** 

Armenia will pretty much end up like Georgia, as long My Step doesn't get too shady or become another HHK in those 3 years. 

The second problem is geopolitical, and it is not good.

A proxy war is inevitable between Russia and Turkey, and Armenia will be in the frontlines, Artsakh is at stake and the Russians are all but happy to never give us back Artsakh as long as they want, we must make concessions and forget about the 7 rayons. We must negotiate with the Azerbaijanis and get Shushi and Hadrut and Talish back from them, we have lost so much, and slacking off is what lead to us in our defeat against Turkey.

Russia should not be trusted, if Artsakh is free and under Armenian control, **leave the Russians, they have become a security threat to our nation.** 

Don't worry about Syunik, Syunik is so heavily protected by Iranian and Russian interests that even the USA in the 90's would never touch it, worry about our institutions, leadership and foreign policy, we are isolated and we are damn well not going to become another Georgia.

**And next time, I don't want to see 4000 new graves.** We lost badly, and it came at a large cost to us. 

**This is the price of total defeat.** 

Conclusion

It took me a good 3 hours to write this up, I have been thinking about the future in every possible scenario, and this is what lead to my research, the future looks harsh for everyone, and we, as a people, as a nation, must always prepare for the worst.

11/26/2020,Diplomacy,"I think Armenia resorting to old and tried methods is a huge mistake at the current time. Currently, Armenia and Azerbaijani relations have been placed on a reset. A new starting position. We see that the actors here weren’t heavily dependent on states but rather their leader’s actions. We have increasingly heard from notable people in regard to the consequences of our rhetoric even when oriented internally. We know, what we do now will set a new tone.

Currently, I see Armenia pursuing war crime grievances, subtle and indirect hostility in tone which is normal given the senseless loss of life we just witnessed, though it is not in our favor, I’ll explain why.

We have a brand new geopolitical reality and with it new options in terms of trajectory. We have an opportunity to remove all barriers and directly discuss with the Azeri government and find a way to soothe relations, this will thereafter improve relations with Turkey and lead to an overall stable peace and prosperity amongst neighbors. I don’t believe that striking a hostile or punitive tone will encourage this trajectory toward a lasting peace. Aliyev has a say here, even Erdogan now has one. We must change the trajectory of our diplomacy to accommodate this reality. A common constructive language must be found with these actors. It is a mutual benefit and they will compromise to meet a mutual goal. This is with the presumption that Azerbaijani National narrative does not dictate continued aggression, hostility, racism toward Armenians and the compromise of status to the remaining Artsakh Republic. There may be a need to continue the Karabakh grievance or narrative given the lack of an appropriate alternative national narrative. This then may orient toward the current direction we are in which is regroup and express grievances, though these actors are swayable and if we can continue discussion and change the tone of our relations, we may achieve a different outcome.

5/18/2023,Why are Georgians and Chechens friends?,"I remember often seeing Georgians and Chechens say that they consider each other to be brothers and good friends, but... why?

Yeah, there are Chechens (Kists) that have been living in Georgia for quite some time, but they surely aren't the reason - there are way more Armenians in Georgia than Kists, but it doesn't sound like Georgia and Armenia are very friendly with each other. And there are plenty of Abkhazians in Georgia (in Abkhazia) but their relationship with Georgians is even more hostile.

And culturally, well, Georgia is almost entirely Christian, while Chechnya is almost entirely Muslim; Chechnya is maybe the most socially conservative part of the Caucasus (?) while I thought Georgia was the most liberal.

It seems like they don't really have much in common besides being Caucasian and hating Russia. But it sounds like *everyone* hates Russia, so what does that prove?

All I can really think of is that I guess Georgia and Chechnya don't really have much historical baggage, like they don't claim the same land and rarely attacked each other? Is that how low the bar is to be considered ""friends"" in the Caucasus?"
5/24/2019,In regard of the Mkhitaryan controversy: The root cause of the conflict between Armenians and Azeri,"In recent weeks there have been a lot of discussions about Mkhitaryan not willing to play the EL final in Baku because the lack of safety for him. And also Azerbaijan's unwillingness to hand out visas for fans with Armenian surnames. While I normally don't write about politics in this sub I am of the opinion that there are some cases where it is necessary to do so because sports and politics intermingle more often than most people wish. So what is the cause for the bloody conflict between Armenians and Azeris? First of all it's not a historically deep lying issue. Actually, it is a fairly recent one, dating back to the 19th century. Forgive me dear readers for simplifying certain events for the sake of shortening this writeup.


Let's start with the Armenians. Armenia has a very old history but despite this fact they only were really independent for several rather short times, unluckily being sandwiched between stronger empires. Greeks, Romans and Ottomans in the West, Russians in the North, Arabs in the South and Persians in the East. So far I can remember only one instance where nearly all Armenians were [united into one state](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Armenian_Empire.png) under the leadership of Tigranes the Great. As already stated this souvereignity did not held long and soon Armenia was the battleground between Rome and Persia, serving as some kind of buffer zone, each empire vying for dominance in that region. In the early 4th century AD there were two very important events which shaped the Armenian identity until today: the adoption of Christianity as state religion (actually the first country in the world to do so) and the development of the unique Armenian alphabet. With the rise of the Umayyad Caliphate large parts of Armenia became part of their large empire. But despite the overlordship of the muslim Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, Armenians mostly retained their christian religion. In the Middle Ages the region was ravaged first by Seljuk Turks who mostly settled in Anatolia and later the Mongols and their successor states who controlled large parts of the Middle East.

In the 16th century Armenia was contested between two new growing empires, the turkish Ottoman dynasty in the West and the persian Safavid dynasty in the East. While Western Armenia was situated in today's turkish Eastern Anatolia, Eastern Armenia around today's capital Erevan was controlled by Persia for several centuries. The situation in Eastern Armenia changed with the expansionism of the Russian Empire which was trying to assert control of the Caucasus region in the early 19th century. Persia was unable to contest the russian expansion and within a few decades lost control.

The situation for Armenians in Russia and Turkey wasn't ideal but they were able to prosper to a certain degree. They were renowned for their entrepeneurial skills and many of them did hold high positions in both empires. But of course their success also raised suspicions from their overlords. But before we finally jump into modern times and the root for the Armenian-Azeri conflict let's take a short look on the history of Azerbaijan.

The name Azerbaijan is also quite old but actually it wasn't related to the lands of the modern republic. The origin of the name dates back to a certain powerful persian vassal named Atropates who ruled over parts in nowaday's Northwestern Iran. With Alexander the Great's conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, the so called *Kingdom of Atropatene* became a Greek vassal but after some time it was able to declare independence. But not for long since the reemerging Persian Empire under the Arsacid and later Sassanid dynasties were able to conquer this area. In this time the name of the kingdom changed to *Aturpatakan* which in turn developed over centuries to *Adurbadagan* and then finally to *Azarbaydjan*. Like Armenians, Azeri living in the north (around Baku) mostly embraced christianity while the Azeris who lived in the southern region around Tabriz (in Northern Iran) were Zoroastrians. This changed with the rise of the Arabs in the Middle East. Under Arab rule the vast majority of the Azeri population became muslim although this was not done in a few years, actually it took many generations. Another deep impact was the conquest of Seljuk Turks in the 11th century. While genetically the change wasn't as deep as usually thought by some scholars it brought a major impact on their language. It's the reason why Azerbaijani belongs to the Turkic language family. And finally there was another deep impact on religion since the Persian Safavid dynasty embraced Shia Islam in the 16th century which is the reason why modern Azeri are mostly Shiites unlike the vast majority of muslims, who are Sunni. Like Eastern Armenia, Northern Azerbaijan was conquered by the Russian Empire in the early 19th century.

In the end of the 19th century there was a global rise of nationalism which brought many problems for multi-ethnic empires like Austria-Hungary or the Ottoman Empire. In Anatolia there were [millions of Armenians living within the Ottoman state*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Ethnic_map_of_Asia_Minor_and_Caucasus_in_1914.jpg) but with the crumbling power of the *Sublime Porte* in world politics, the Greek independence and the loss of large portions of its european holdings, the repercussions for the Armenian minority in Turkey were pretty severe. Under the reign of the so called *Bloody Sultan* Abdul Hamid II, hundreds of thousands Armenians were killed. Things became even worse in World War I. While the Ottoman Empire was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Russia was allied with Great Britain and France. Many Armenian volunteers fought for the Russian Army which angered the Turks who saw them as traitors and a threat. Once again there were massacres and mass deportations, an event which is known as the *Armenian Genocide*. A sensitive topic for many people. While most modern scholars mostly agree it was a genocide and up to 30 countries nowadays recognize it, modern Turkey still denies it. Nevertheless this changed the ethnic composition in the Caucasus region since most Armenians now left Turkey and also a reason for the worldwide Armenian diaspora.

The influx of Armenian refugees into the Caucasus was seen with distrust by the neighbouring Azeri people. The region of Nagorno-Karabakh became ethnically predominantly Armenian at that time and there were several massacres on both sides. The fight over this terriory but also the ethnic and religious differences and the jealousy of the Azeri because of the more wealthy Armenians led to growing antipathy. In the early 20's of the 20th century the Soviet Union amplified this conflict with the decision to give the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Azerbaijani SSR despite it being mostly populated by Armenians. Many scholars think the reason for that was to gain sympathy in Turkey, who was traditionally friendly to Azerbaijan, with the hope, the communistic world revolution might spread to Ankara and Istanbul. Nevertheless the conflict in this region stopped for a while, at least on the surface.

In the late 80's with the declining power of Moscow, tensions between Armenians and Azeri once again intensified. A few years later the Soviet Union was abolished and both Armenia and Azerbaijan became independent. Shortly after Armenian forces invaded Nagorno-Karabakh and conquered it. Immediately after that Nagorno-Karabakh became an [independent country called Artsakh](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Nagorno-Karabakh_Map2.png). While nearly every country in the world considers it de jure as part of Azerbaijan it is de facto a part of Armenia.

The unresolved status of this region is the main factor for the hostilities between Armenians and Azeri nowadays and sadly it is unlikely to change within the near future.

Interesting sidenote: The historical region of Azerbaijan in Northern Iran is up to this day [mostly inhabitated by Azeri](https://www.theapricity.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=40982&d=1385762695). Actually there are about [15 million Azeri living in Iran](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Map_of_Azerbaijani-inhabited_regions_of_Iran%2C_according_to_a_poll_in_2010.png), more than in the Republic of Azerbaijan itself. But only a tiny minority wants a unification with  the northern part. Most feel satisfied with the Iranian rule and many important positions within the country are held by Azeri.

9/22/2022,S.06 - Statement On the Recognition of the Armenian Genocide [DEBATE],"## Statement On the Recognition of the Armenian Genocide

Madam Speaker, thank you for scheduling time for this statement

Madam Speaker, for a hundred years, this country, and the New Zealand Government has cowardly turned a blind eye to the atrocities committed in Armenia, and the Armenian diaspora in the Ottoman Empire in 1915-16.

This systematic annihilation and relocation of Armenian communities across eastern Anatolia was a human rights tragedy of the type we have seen all too frequently in modern history, and of the kind we have a moral duty to condemn.

Madam Speaker, nobody in this House and vanishingly few in New Zealand were alive when these horrible acts took place, but this does not make them any less relevant to the modern day. Tensions have not gone away, and in much of Armenia and eastern Anatolia they remain raw.

On Monday, Azerbaijani soldiers again clashed with Armenian ones in border disputes in the Nagorno-Karabakh region and Armenian sources report that since that time, 105 Armenian soldiers have died, an action which Turkish President Erdoğan has endorsed. This is just the latest chapter in the catalogue of woes that Armenia has faced since the First World War.

I hope this house will join me in celebrating the unique identity of the Armenian people, their customs and their way of life, and I pray that old wounds will eventually heal. If the House will allow me, I wish to add a small personal anecdote that makes the recent news of hostilities sting a little more. Earlier this summer, I went to Istanbul, and when I was there I attended an Armenian Christian church service, and there I prayed for reconciliation between Armenians and Turks. It feels like that is a long way off.

In light of recent events that I have just outlined, His Majesty’s Government has taken the decision to formally recognise the atrocities committed to Armenians in 1915-16 as a Genocide, nearly 100 years too late

* These are all within the last 4-6 months (minus a few)

I couldn't figure out why they were being so hostile to us and doing weird shit like founding organisations like the ""Hindu American Foundation"" when they are Christian? We have never interacted with them and didn't even know they existed.

Well I did some research since then and it's all apparently to do with this land they stole and occupied called Nagorno-Karabakh that was recently liberated? I read up on the genocides and massacres and my heart sank for you guys. 

What bothered me is that even though you guys had suffered more than them, you did not go seeking revenge and were still patient with them in the hopes that they would be fair and return your land through diplomacy (even if it was just the surrounding areas) but they didn't care. 

Reading up on the recent war I am so happy for you guys having got the land back and Nagorno-Karabakh. So just wanted to say congratulations. Your story has a lot of similarity with Kashmir (we've only managed to liberate about 40% of it, China liberated 20% and the rest is occupied by India). 

Inshallah one day we'll liberate Kashmir too just like you guys did. Your story honestly gave me hope :)"
4/26/2021,Neighbouring countries,"So I've had an interest in Armenia for a long time and I'm hoping to visit after all this covid drama has passed. I live in China at the moment and met a few guys from Iran in a bar, and asked them why Azerbaijan and Turkey treat Armenia with such hostility but Iranians don't (from a Western perspective this seemed quite strange to me). They both said that before the 1800s both countries had almost identical daily culture and Iranians generally respect and highly regard Armenians. Is the feeling mutual from the Armenian side?"

10/26/2020,Danzig model as a potential peacful solution,"So I was recently thinking about a realistic peacful solution for the conflict, especially given the fact that Armenia is basically losing and Russia is not interested in intervention.  If we look at it objectively, the majority of Karabakh is vastly under populated. As the Azerbaijani army advances a couple thousand of people will have to flee to Armenia, while quite unfortunate, it's not such a big deal in the grand scheme of things. The biggest issue in my opinion is Stepanakert/ Khankendi. It has a fairly large population and if Azerbaijani forces enter the town it will be a humanitarian disaster (also a diplomatic suicide for Azerbaijan itself).  

Perhaps with the inevitble advance of the Azerbaijani army, the best solution would be to make Stepanakert a UN governed territory like Danzig after WW1. When the League of Nations couldn't outright give a majority German town to Poland they simply made it independent with a UN controlled government. Ik that due to WW2 it didn't really work out but I think that given the advanced state of modern diplomacy and relative weakness of both Armenia and Azerbaijan on the world stage this could be an option.  The government of Armenia won't completely lose face, the local Armenian population will be able to continue living safely, and Azerbaijan will return most of it's lands and it's people can come back into their homes. Perhaps Stepanakert can be gradually pushed towards economic integration with Azerbaijan and in a couple of decades it will naturally join it when the hostilities cool off. 

&#x200B;

Maybe this is silly, but I am interested to hear you guy's thoughts."

8/2/2022,"Possible 9 days in Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia)","Ciao fellow travelers,

I’ve seen few post about it, hence why I’m looking for any advice/suggestions (of any kind) from people that did the same trip.

I would say to have some experience as a traveller (36 countries), I am male, 26, Italian passport and most likely I’ll be doing this trip solo.

I am aware of the current situation, regions to avoid and the impossibility of crossing Armenian-Azeri border. Also, as per advisories, I’m thinking to stay in Baku only while in Azerbaijan and then fly to Georgia.

I am extremely flexible on transportation, accommodation, and budget (could either go very cheap or medium-high). Anyway, i’m not flexible on the number of countries as I am determined to visit all 3, even though time is very little (I’m willing to cut a few things). I’d follow the title order due to avoid questioning and entry restrictions.

The only dates available would be 
28 October - 6 November 
OR 
2 December - 11 December 
since work is not very flexible and could travel only during bank holiday.

I know weather should be quite frigid in winter but I’ll take it anyway.

Any suggestions on dates, what I should absolutely avoid, and what I should definitely go for? I am an enthusiast so everything will go.

Lastly, as for now, I would ideally do ca. 2-3-4 Dec in Baku, 4-5-6-7 In Georgia, and 7-8-9 in Armenia, plan yet TBD.

Thank you very much in advance for any help!"

Similar to the Iberian one but in Persia with Persian rulers, Abbasid and Arab rulers, rulers in the north of Persia, like Oghuz Il and some north-western Indian realms. 

Faiths involved: Zoroastrianism, Gayomarthianism, Ash’arism, Maturidism, Mahayanism, Apostolicism

Cultures involved: <all cultures with Persian heritage>>, Armenian, Mashriqui, Syriac, Sindhi, Punjabi, Sogodian.

ENDINGS:
“xxx Dominance ending”:
It could be cool to try and reunite Persia under the Bavanid dynasty (last Sassanids), bringing back Zoroastrianism as the main religion; or playing as the Abbasid Caliphate, reconquering Persia like the Umayyads did the first time; or maybe trying to migrate in the region as the Oghuz rulers (Just like the Seljuks some centuries later) and establishing a Tengri Persian Empire; or just uniting Persia under a total new Indian dynasty, creating a new culture with new traditions and fashions.

Status Quo ending:
Just like in the Iberian Struggle, in the Persian struggle there should be the Status Quo ending where everyone get’s his own empire and the Persian Empire is dismantled. 

Uninvolved Rulers ending:
Obviously once a ruler enters the region, it’s involved, and if his culture and religion are not he can take the decision of restoring the Persian Empire without ending the Struggle. Once the decision it’s taken, he will receive a free claim on every duchy of the Persian region.


ofc this is just a small idea but it could be cool, also because right now the only struggle it’s the Iberian one and we need at least one more."

12/30/2020,Isn't Russia a real problem for the South Caucasus between Armenia and Azerbaijan?,"Just ask yourself when Turks (Azerbaijanis) and Armenians started to kill each other?

When Russians came. And what Russia did? They isolated Muslims from administrative duties, prohibited to serve in Army and carry weapons while Armenians became a huge power in Muslim-populated Baku with a support of Russians. Just in 50 years, Baku ended up being Russian-Armenian. I even don't talk about re-settling Armenians back to the South Caucasus which created the real tensions between Turks and Armenians in the region. 

What did Russians do afterwards? Since 1886, Russians started to involve Muslims into the power in Baku, giving them many privileges which worsened the position of Armenian elites and it resulted in mutual massacres right after the first Russian revolution of 1905 when Russians openly spread the hatred between both ethnicities to keep control over them?

Wasn't it Russia who just promised Ottoman Armenians to support Russian Empire in WWI what was defined among Turks as a betrayal and as a result, Russians neither helped Armenians nor saved them from revenge of Ottomans but vice versa, just sold out Armenia in 20s when dividing the South Caucasus between the USSR and Turkey? 

Wasn't it Russia who decided to create Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast with the borders including into it the more Armenian and the less Azerbaijani settlements as possible but at the same time adding to this subject an Azerbaijani populated town of Shusha which just increased the future tension of the conflict?

Why the conflict didn't start in 40-s, 50-s or 60-s but it started during falling the USSR as if Russia just needed a reason to control their ""independent"" puppets in the Caucasus?

And this year, Azerbaijanis and Armenians were ready to kill each other again exactly when pro-Western Pashinyan got his popularity in Armenia, Pro-Putin Alıyev achieved the highest risk of being thrown out from the power in Azerbaijan and eventually Russia got rid of Pashinyan, made his bro Alıyev a hero and got a new military base in the South Caucasus.

Are Azerbaijanis and Armenians really stupid because they just don't see all their ""national interests and pride"" are just a lovely bloody toy for Russians to play and keep the influence as a ""peacekeeper""?"

9/17/2023,"When Russian forces resettled 300,000 Ottoman Armenians to the Caucasus in 1915-16, nearly half perished from starvation and epidemics. 50,000 out of 200,000 Armenians in independent Armenia perished due to epidemics in Yerevan in 1918-19.","An estimated 300,000 Ottoman Armenians were resettled by Russian forces (which including Armenian volunteer units) to the Caucasus in 1915-16, resulting in nearly half perishing from starvation and epidemics:

> By the end of 1916, nearly three hundred thousand Ottoman Armenians had sought safety in Transcaucasia, where nearly half were destined to die from famine and disease. (1)

According to official statistics of the Armenian Republic, forwarded to the French military attaché in the Caucasus, Pierre Chardigny, in early-1918, 50,000 Armenians left Eastern Anatolia to the newly autonomous Armenia, which soon became independent, bringing the population to 200,000 (150,000 survivors of the Russian resettlements and new refugees). However, due to the 1918-19 epidemics in Armenia and the Dashnak administration's incompetence, the population was again reduced to 150,000. (2)

Richard Hovannisian again describes the situation:

> Cholera reached epidemic proportions by the end of August, 1918. The meager supply of medications and disinfectants had been exhausted and there was no hope of receiving new shipments from abroad. It was impossible to quarantine the infected, who lived among the populace in crowded, unsanitary hutches. The refugee masses, roaming the countryside in search of food, spread the disease over the breadth of the land. Dr. Hovhannes Ter-Mikayelian, chairman of the Khorhurd’s medical-sanitation committee, decried the inefficacy of the Ministry of Interior and urged that his own committee be vested with dictatorial powers to cope with the crisis. He upbraided the nation’s physicians and intellectuals for shirking the responsibility to educate the public in hygienic practices and to minister to the rural sick. Aram Manukian refuted the charges leveled at his department and offered proof of significant progress in stemming the disease. Overriding Aram's objections, however, the legislature named the medical-sanitation committee the supreme authority in the crusade against cholera, a battle finally won at the end of November, 1918. But as the wave of cholera ebbed, an even more avaricious killer reared its ugly head—typhus.

> The proposal of the Ministry of Interior to disarm the citizenry provoked the most intense domestic controversy of 1918. Its decrees and decisions unheeded, the government was scandalized by the insolence of gangs of bandits, who robbed and killed in broad daylight These so-called ""mauserists"" had become so bold as to extend their activities into Erevan itself. As matters stood, Aram warned, the government could not establish law and order or wield real authority until the entire civilian population had been disarmed and taught to respect discipline. He refuted the argument that an armed populace constituted an important military asset; it was an asset only for anarchy. (3)

#Armenia

[Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia) is a country in the caucasus. It is located to the east of Turkey. Between 1915 and 1916, the Armenian genocide happened, where between 300,000 and 1,500,000 Armenians died. Recently, some countries have taken steps to classify it as a genocide while other countries remain either undecided on the issue or deny that a genocide happened. 

Despite being a poor country, Armenia’s education system is considered very good, thanks to high government spending on education. It became the first Christian country in the world in 301. Prominent Armenians include the boxer Arthur Abraham, the footballer Henrich Mchitarjan (ManU) and Video Game composer Clint Bajakian. Many international stars have Armenian heritage, for example Kim Kardashian or Charles Aznavour.

Problem: Armenia and Azerbaijan are at it again, preventing a united Caucasus front for the upcoming Operation Russian Freedom.

Opportunities: Armenia is a democracy, so democratic peace theory applies. Azerbaijan is the one who's getting Alsace-Lorraine'd so most NATO and NATO allied countries generally support them.

Solution:

1) Send NATO representative to Armenia. Exploit Russia's failure to honour CSTO Article 4 by guaranteeing security for Armenia. Use diplomatic pressure to pursuade Armenia not to strike against Azerbaijan. Invite Armenia to NATO.

2) Send NATO representative to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan's already on good terms with Turkey and Ukraine so they'll welcome NATO. Tell Azerbaijan not to fuck around anymore. Invite Azerbaijan to NATO.

3) Maybe invite Georgia along the way, why not.

Anticipated obstacles:

Turkey and Greece.

10/3/2023,Question about history of Azerbaijan,"First of all, I know this is controversial, and I want to be clear , I don't mean to offend anyone. I am a citizen of Western Europe and I like your country Azerbaijan and have a general interest in the South Caucasus region. I just want to clarify some aspects about its history. 
I know your country was born in 1918 basically from the Persian territories that were conquered by Russia in the 19th century Russian-Persian war. When Russia faced the 1917 Revolution, those territories took advantage of the situation to declare independence and create the country of Azerbaijan. The name of Azerbaijan, which was never used before for that area, was taken from the adjacent region of Persia for political reasons (the new born country of Azerbaijan planned to inglobate into its territory also that Persian region). 
Therefore, why politically in Azerbaijan there's often the reference about ""ancient Azerbaijani lands"" when the country of Azerbaijan never existed before 1918, also talking about the region of Iran whose name was Azerbaijan long before 1918, and even territories of modern Armenia which are often referred in Azerbaijan as ""Western Azerbaijan"" . Why does a country which didn't exist as independent before 1918 and never was called Azerbaijan before, whose people are of mixed ethnic origin, which territory in 1920 had uncertain borders based of League of Nations, claim its current territory, and also great parts of Iran and Armenia as ""ancient historically Azerbaijani"" ?


Many thanks to those who answered. I now understand your point."

In both cases though I stop after making a decently sized kingdom just cause my favorite part of the game is empire building and city planning.

11/6/2022,Iran Battles Turkish Influence in South Caucasus,">  
>  
>Iran is trying to regain its influence in the South Caucasus. In October, it announced large-scale military exercises, dubbed “Mighty Iran”, near the border with Azerbaijan. The drills, a repeat of last year’s, should be seen as an expression of the growing discomfort within the Islamic Republic toward what it sees as the worsening geopolitical situation in the South Caucasus.  
>  
>  
>  
>The wargames were held along the Aras river, which mostly separates Iran from Azerbaijan, and involved practicing river crossings, a signal of the offensive possibilities of the drills. The date of the exercises also coincided with October 2020, when Azerbaijan reclaimed lost territories from Armenia along Iran’s northern border.  
>  
>  
>  
>The South Caucasus are often termed “troubled” by outsiders given a history of invasion, shifting boundaries, and internecine warfare. The three small states of the region, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, are surrounded by a more powerful and populous triad of neighbors; Russia, Turkey, and Iran, each of which has an intimate interest in developments.  
>  
>  
>  
>Following the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War of 2020, Iran’s power in the region diminished, with Turkey the main winner because of its support for Azerbaijan’s military triumph. Iran worries that its closest partner, Armenia, is now seriously weakened, while emboldened Azerbaijan is suspected of pushing for further major territorial changes. The Islamic Republic, therefore, has good reason to try to reshape events to conform to its national interests.  
>  
>  
>  
>Although Iran is officially silent, the underlying sentiment behind its recent moves is motivated partly by Azerbaijan’s newfound strength and partly by Turkey’s. The latter has substantially increased its position in the South Caucasus following the 2020 war. **Ankara supplied Azerbaijan with modern weaponry, including drones, trained its soldiers, signed an official treaty of alliance, and set its gaze toward the Caspian Sea and further into Central Asia, especially Turkmenistan. Turkey’s growing role might also be seen as benefitting the West (it is, after all, a NATO member), which adds another element to Iran’s discomfort. Some now see the prospect of an arc of powerful alliance Turkic states emerging along its northern borders.**  
>  
>  
>  
>The problem is further exacerbated by Azerbaijan’s increasingly coercive behavior toward Armenia. The latter, badly defeated in the 2020 war, is simply unable to resist Azerbaijan’s military power, as seen again in September. Talks on the imminent peace treaty between the two countries are underway and this poses a real risk for Iran; Armenia may be forced to agree to an east-west Azeri corridor through its southernmost province of Syunik, which could block Iran’s free movement northward. This explains Iran’s stark statements that the country would not allow any changes to the borders of the South Caucasus states. In just one recent example, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in an interview that, “Iran will not permit the blockage of its connection route with Armenia, and in order to secure that objective the Islamic Republic of Iran launched a wargame in that region.”  
>  
>  
>  
>In another move, which amounted to a veiled message, Amir-Abdollahian on October 21 opened a new consulate in Kopan, the center of Armenia’s Syunik region. The geography says it all – Iran is serious about maintaining the territorial status quo in the region. Moreover, the visit pointedly coincided with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s trip to Azerbaijan’s Zangilan region.  
>  
>  
>  
>The Syunik strip is effectively Iran’s only route into the South Caucasus free of Turkic influence, and thus the geopolitical stakes are high. The loss of this connection would make Iran increasingly reliant on the goodwill of the Turko-Azerbaijani alliance, putting the two countries in a very powerful position. Such a development would probably also put paid to Iran’s hopes of building a corridor to Georgia.  
>  
>  
>  
>Iran would also lose its current leverage over Azerbaijan, which has to use Iranian transit routes to reach its Nakhchivan exclave. In July, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei voiced his displeasure with a potential Azeri transport corridor through Armenian territory, cutting out his country.  
>  
>  
>  
>Iran’s recent moves thus have to be seen within this wider geo-economic prism. The competition with Turkey is silent but nevertheless serves as a driving force in shaping Iran’s posture. Russia can be relied on to offer some support, since it too worries about Turkish assertiveness, as it has since Czarist times. But the Kremlin is itself constrained because it needs Turkey, in particular, its neutrality in the disastrous war against Ukraine. This goes a long way to explaining Russia’s tolerance of Turkey’s bold moves through its rapprochement with Armenia, military aid to Azerbaijan and Georgia, and other initiatives deep inside Central Asia.  
>  
>  
>  
>That by no means makes Vladimir Putin happy about the rising Turkish influence. But it means that competition is now rather sotto voce even as the stakes increase. Iran’s wargames are not mere posturing; it’s establishing that it has key interests at stake in the future of the region.

2/23/2019,Armenia! The new modern art hub of the Caucasus?,
3/28/2023,Migration from the Steppe to South Caucasus unlikely,"> Having established a general profile for the Neolithic South-Caucasus, we explored the transitions in the genetic structure of Bronze Age populations from the South-Caucasus, including Kura-Araxes individuals from Kalavan-1, the Talin necropolis and the tombs of Kaps in Armenia1,36 as well as all the individuals recently published by Lazaridis et al.22. Sadly, no ancient DNA could be retrieved from the Mentesh Tepe Chalcolithic levels. With almost all D-stats of the form D(Mbuti, Mentesh; Caucasus BA, Anatolia BA/Caucasus BA) being null, we do not see any preferential gene flow from Mentesh Tepe into one Bronze Age population from the South Caucasus or Anatolia (Supplementary Fig. 6).

> The PCA shows that all the Bronze Age individuals from Armenia plot together and are shifted toward the Steppe cluster. In the ADMIXTURE analysis, they all exhibit a red component, absent in the Neolithic Mentesh Tepe individuals but maximised in Steppe populations and present, also, in CHG individuals. Interestingly, individuals from Chalcolithic Armenia (from Areni-1 cave, four of whom are directly dated by C14) do carry this Steppe/CHG component, whereas a Chalcolithic individual from Alkhantepe in Azerbaijan does not. D-statistics of the form D(Mbuti, Steppe Eneolithic; Mentesh Tepe, South Caucasus Bronze Age) are almost all significantly positive (Z-score: +2.1 to +5.8), highlighting a gene flow to the South Caucasus from the Steppes or from a population linked to CHG after the Neolithic period. This result can be interpreted with two different hypotheses: either a Neolithic population from North-Caucasus or an ancestral population from the South Caucasus carrying a small proportion of Steppe/CHG ancestry replaced the local Mentesh-like Neolithic population in South-Caucasus, or a population from the steppe north of the Caucasus migrated south and admixed with the local population.

> To test for these hypotheses, we used qpAdm with the rotating method37 and modelled the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age populations found in Armenia. The only fitting model for Areni-1 cave (Chalcolithic Armenia) is an admixture between 25% Steppe and 75% Mentesh (p-value = 0.02) (Supplementary Fig. 7). During the Bronze Age, we observe an increase in Steppe contribution from the Early Bronze Age Kura-Araxes (0–10% Steppe contribution) to the Middle and Late Bronze Age individuals (around 40% Steppe contribution). This increase could be linked to a wave of migration from the north during the Bronze Age, or to a continuous admixture between Steppe and South Caucasus populations, maybe through North-Caucasus groups, as the latter are genetically close to the South Caucasus population during the Maikop period/Bronze Age36. For the Early Bronze Age populations of Armenia, we also note that the best models (p = 0.08 for Talin and Karavan and p = 0.51 for Kaps) are involving CHGs instead of a Steppe population. This suggests that the admixture at the base of the Kura-Araxes ancestry occurred between an unsampled population from the Caucasus with a profile more similar to the Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers and a Mentesh-like population from the Late Chalcolithic period. Thus, it is unlikely that Kura-Araxes populations had yet received a significant gene flow from the Steppe at this period. Models involving the only Middle Chalcolithic individual from the North Caucasus (from the Unakozovskaya cave)36 available to date did fit but not as well as the other models (0.01 < p-value < 0.05). Though we note that for Kura-Araxes the models involving the North Caucasus individuals were more successful than for the LBA populations, no nested model involving 100% of North Caucasus Neolithic was detected. In other words, the Bronze Age or Chalcolithic individuals found in Armenia cannot be modelled as 100% North-Caucasus Neolithic. **This result suggests that the admixture scenario is more likely than the migration one, given the individuals sequenced for now**.

2/19/2023,Imagine an Alliance Between Democratic Armenia and Democratic Iran,"To my Armenian sisters and brothers,  
I'm truly heart broken and utterly enraged by the genocidal encroachment and siege of Artsakh. The pan-Turkish fascism created by the dictators of Turkey and Azerbaijan is a scourge. I hope that if Iranians can overthrow their own facists (who have recently been trying to create an Islamo-Persian Ultranationalist ideology), that a new democratic Iran will become the ally Armenia deserves. As a Persian and Kurd, I view see that our political fortunes are linked in building a Caucasus and Middle East that is anti-nationalist, anti-sectarian, and anti-authoritarian. Fingers crossed that the freedom loving peoples of Armenia and Iran can be the foundation of change in this region."

7/16/2020,US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo deeply concerned about recent deadly violence along the Armenia-Azerbaijan international border. You think Pompeo knows where Armenia and Azerbaijan are or what the Caucasus is?,
8/11/2021,Armenia in the area of interests of Russia and NATO,"The South Caucasus, including Armenia, is in an area of intense geostrategic and geopolitical rivalry between Russia and NATO, which is accompanied by an increase in local, civil, terrorist and criminal proxy wars, as well as economic, psychological and cyber wars.

Geopolitical centers are fighting for the cultural, civilizational and economic orientation of the Armenian society and its elite, as it creates a favorable environment for promoting their own interests in the region.

After Azerbaijan, with the help of Turkey, seized part of the Republic of Artsakh, and Armenia suffered huge human losses, some paid political circles and experts blame Russia for the defeats and losses, whipping up anti-Russian sentiments.

Meanwhile, NATO is militarily represented by the Turkish armed forces both in the South Caucasus and in Afghanistan, where after the withdrawal of the US military the protection of some military installations is entrusted to the Turkish armed forces.

NATO provides all kinds of support to Turkey, as Ankara continues to promote the interests of the bloc in various regions. Armenia has already become a victim of the NATO policy. However, Washington's patronage of increasing Turkey's influence can lead to even more radical consequences in the South Caucasus."

##U.S. supports sending an international mission to ensure the security of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians; Russia responds

The U.S. and Armenia want to send an international mission to Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia isn't so sure.

**U.S. STATE DEPT:** Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh should be able to remain and live in their homes in peace and dignity. They should be allowed to safely return to their homes and their passage should be overseen by a neutral 3rd party. Azerbaijan has a responsibility to protect civilians and ensure the humane treatment of all, including those it suspects of being combatants.

We believe there should be an international mission to provide transparency, reassurance, and confidence to the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh and the international community, that their rights and security will be protected. //

**KREMLIN:** Any mission to Karabakh is possible only with the permission of the government of Azerbaijan. We have not yet seen any concrete suggestions by the U.S. to send an observation mission. Russia is already on the ground. //

##Russia to Armenia: don't forget that we sell you gas for a discount price

##Why is it difficult for Armenia to leave CSTO? Ranking member of the ruling party explains 

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan says Armenia's defense partnership is insufficient yet Armenia is still a member of CSTO. Are you discussing the topic of exiting CSTO?

**ARMEN KHACHATRYAN:** Of course there are extensive discussions but leaving CSTO is not a simple task. Armenia has since signed numerous agreements with CSTO and interstate agreements. Everything needs to be addressed separately. Currently, we do not see any benefit in a quick exit from CSTO. We have to weigh the benefits and risks. There is currently no legal process to launch the exit.

**REPORTER:** According to USAID's Samantha Power, Pashinyan has made concrete proposals for AM-US cooperation. What can you tell us about Pashinyan's letter to the White House? 

**KHACHATRYAN:** I haven't read the content but Armenia wants to strengthen its security. The U.S. could help. The 13 September 2022 attack on Armenia was stopped with the help of a phone call from the U.S. Currently, the only state that's capable of countering Turkey and Azerbaijan to maintain peace in our region is the U.S.

##Armenian parliament will discuss the ratification of the Rome Statute in a first hearing next week 

The 4-day session begins on October 3. Prior to this, a parliamentary commission will have to first approve the draft bill on September 28.

Armenia says it's a step to hold Azerbaijani war criminals accountable that could also serve as a restraining force. Russia says it's a step against Russia.

**RULING PARTY MP:** We are going to ratify it. The team agrees. The International Criminal Court was formed primarily to respond to acts of genocide and crimes against humanity. We see a textbook example of ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh today. We must ratify the Statute now so we can bring the perpetrators to justice. Sooner or later Ilham Aliyev is going to face justice. 

**REPORTER:** How will Russia respond to the ratification of the Rome Statute?

**RULING PARTY MP:** The Russian military is highly dissatisfied by the political decisions made by the Kremlin when it comes to the inaction towards Azerbaijani aggression. There is a political decision not to assist Armenia. 

Sure, there would be more heated diplomatic exchanges after the ratification, but it's already brazen as it is. Some Russian officials and media figures have made impudent statements. I advise my Russian colleagues to restrain and shut the mouths of Margarita Simonyan and the likes of her. Even those Armenians who have long viewed Russia as an ally are making a 180-degree turn after statements made by the likes of Margarita Simonyan. Shut their mouths.

Even after 2018, Armenia took steps to strengthen AM-RU relations. This is why people with a friendly attitude to Russia were appointed as defense officials in Armenia. Some of them were USSR-era officials and figures. 

**REPORTER:** But Pashinyan appointed Armen Grigoryan [strongly pro-West] as the head of the National Security Council, against Russia's will.

**RULING PARTY MP:** Hello? Is every appointee supposed to be Russia's pick? Ա՜յ քեզ բան․ Why should Russia itself pick and choose whom we appoint? We have taken reasonable steps to maintain good AM-RU relations but today we see that Russia is not a guarantor of Armenia's security. We saw the outcome of the Turkish-Russian-Azeri agreement in Nagorno-Karabakh. This is the turning point. What should we thank Russia for?

**REPORTER:** What about the situation around Syunik and Azerbaijan's ""corridor"" demands?

**RULING PARTY MP:** Russia is not helping us to protect Syunik. Quite the contrary. I won't open the parenthesis. We must very quickly invite the international community to act as a restraining force.

28,120 people have moved to Armenia as of Tuesday. A third of them are children. They will stay in a temporary humanitarian camp in southern Armenia before receiving housing in various settlements across the country.

Sweden has donated $1.3M for food, transportation, and cash donations to refugees. EU will provide $5M. France will provide $7M.

##USAID chief about the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh:

**SAMANTHA POWER:** During the 9 months that the government of Azerbaijan blocked this corridor, it created excruciating humanitarian conditions for the people. The government of Azerbaijan shut out access to humanitarian organizations and independent eyes.

The military attacks of last week have made a dire situation even worse. It is absolutely critical that humanitarian orgs are granted full and unimpeded access through the Lachin corridor into the villages and towns of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The U.S. will provide $11.5M in humanitarian assistance to provide everything from food to psycho-social support, and to help reunite many unaccompanied children with their families.

**REPORTER:** Will the U.S. impose sanctions on Azerbaijan or Aliyev for the ethnic cleansing?

**SAMANTHA POWER:** I'm here to gather the facts and testimonies and pass the info to the White House after which a decision will be made on how to respond. There are a range of options under active consideration. I look forward to bringing back the experience and testimonies and being able to describe to my colleagues in government just how grave the circumstances have been for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.

##independent analysts from Azerbaijan have so far identified 200 Azeri soldiers killed during their aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh

The list of full names was published by Meydan TV.

[source,](https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/270055)



##290 wounded, 125 dead, dozens still missing after yesterday's fuel storage explosion near Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert 

Context in [Monday report](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16s89r7/exodus_of_armenians_out_of_nagornokarabakh/). Several patients died in a hospital in Stepanakert due to insufficient medical intervention as a result of Azerbaijan's blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

The following day helicopters and ambulances were allowed to enter from Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh with the help of the Red Cross and Russian peacekeepers to evacuate the patients. Azerbaijan sent a van with medicine.

Armenian TV personality [Mane Grigoryan's](https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/270092) brother is missing after the explosion. He was waiting in line to get fuel.

A team led by the British medical doctor Steven Jeffrey from the Royal Army Medical Corps will visit Armenia to treat the patients evacuated out of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

France will send medical equipment to Armenia in the coming hours.

##... what caused the explosion?

The area where the drivers formed a queue for fuel is the size of a soccer pitch. People would approach with their buckets to receive fuel. Since the area was very smelly, some residents preferred to stay away and have the buckets transferred to them. 

The smokers were being told to stay behind barbwires. Eyewitnesses report seeing 3 smokers, but they were standing far away.

Two employees worked on the reservoir. One of them took care of air ventilation, while the other was presumably helping to fill the buckets. 

A witness reports that the air ventilation hole began sucking air inwards. He realized an explosion was about to happen. The blast threw people in different directions. 

There were multiple explosions. Some people had an opportunity to escape from subsequent explosions. They witnessed flames coming out of wells. At some point, the explosions stopped and only fires were left. 

Possible causes:

(1) Eyewitnesses report seeing lightning strikes that reached near the ground that day, but this fuel storage comes equipped with special devices that protect against lightning. 

(2) Smokers were observed but the distance was quite far.

(3) Someone did something inside the reservoir.

(4) ...

##Turkey and Azerbaijan will build a Kars-Nakhijevan railway, will use Iran as a corridor ""if Armenia doesn't want to be part of the Middle Corridor"": agreement signed 

The leaders of Turkey and Azerbaijan met in Nakhijevan on Tuesday to sign three agreements. Two were about jointly building housing in a Turkish region affected by earthquake, and an energy cooperation.

**ERDOGAN:** The signing of the protocol of intent to build the Kars-Nakhijevan railway is also a historical event. I'm confident this railway will become a branch in the part of the Middle Corridor [China-Europe].

If Yerevan doesn't agree for the railway to pass through Armenia, it will travel through Iran instead. Iran is open to the idea. We could create a road to Azerbaijan through Iran.

Having road and railway connections between Nakhijevan and the rest of Azerbaijan is a priority for both Turkey and Azerbaijan. It will strengthen our relations. We will do everything possible to open this corridor as soon as possible. A car or a train departing from Baku could go straight to Kars. It is nice to see positive signals from Iran in this matter. //

##representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijani met in Europe ahead of October 5 Pashinyan-Aliyev meeting || EU wants Azerbaijan to explain ""integration""

**EU's statement (tldr):** The EU, France, and Germany hosted the representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan. They discussed various efforts to address the urgent needs of the Karabakh population. The EU reiterated its criticism of Azerbaijan's military operation. 

Azerbaijan said it would provide humanitarian aid to the Karabakh population. The EU wants this process to be transparent and monitored by international actors.

EU also wants Azerbaijan to clarify its vision for Karabakh Armenians' future as part of Azerbaijan. //

##interview with Armenian parliament's Defense Committee chief Andranik Kocharyan (ruling party)

**REPORTER:** What happened in Stepanakert? 

**ANDRANIK:** Murky and childish processes that began with the landing of Ruben Vardanyan. Then we see mysterious gatherings and dinners. Then the resignations of parliament president and president Arayik, and the transfer of power to ARF. The opposition forces in Armenia clapped and cheered: *""Arayik is gone. We can finally defend Karabakh.""* Then we got the war. 

The only party that didn't take part in the coup was Samvel Babayan. He had earlier presented a plan to find common ground with Azerbaijan. It could have allowed the preservation of many institutions in Nagorno-Karabakh. A mutual understanding was reached with Azerbaijan around 13 of the 15 points of the document. The other 2, pertaining to the fate of the Defense Army, were yet to be negotiated and finalized.

However, the Clan rejected Babayan's negotiation efforts and the Western platform. Nothing was good enough for them. They ran to capitulate in Yevlakh immediately after the attack. 

Now we see how all the weapons accumulated by the Defense Army with great effort for many years are being surrendered today. Moreover, the Clan backstabbed Armenia by agreeing to the language of the documents stating that Armenia had soldiers inside Nagorno-Karabakh.

Samvel Babayan was able to successfully move from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia yesterday. This is very encouraging, the only legitimate leader of Nagorno-Karabakh is now located in Armenia. The Clan in Stepanakert must be held accountable for the anti-Armenian agreement. 

They must also explain to the War Commission why they gave away all the weapons instead of destroying them, or better yet, why they were unable to utilize the broad range of armament at their disposal. Here are some possible options: (1) Someone forced them not to destroy the weapons. (2) Certain individuals personally benefitted from the surrender of weapons. They must testify to the War Commission.

##interview with Samvel Babayan, the Nagorno-Karabakh opposition leader 

**REPORTER:** You arrived yesterday. How was the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh?

**BABAYAN:** The residents of the Martakert region went to Stepanakert, then Yerevan. I was in one of the cars in the column. Heavy traffic.

**REPORTER:** Everyone wants to know how you were able to cross the checkpoint without being arrested by Azeri agents. After all, you were an active member of the 1st Karabakh War.

**BABAYAN:** When I entered Nagorno-Karabakh 7 months ago, Lachin was already blocked at the time. Everyone also wondered how I was able to get in. At the time I said that I could enter or leave Nagorno-Karabakh whenever I wanted.

Nothing extraordinary happened. I got out of the car like everyone else, greeted the Azeri checkpoint agent, walked 15 meters, greeted another cop, got in the car and proceeded to Armenia. 

It doesn't matter why I was confident I wouldn't get arrested. There are self-proclaimed heroes now in Nagorno-Karabakh hiding under their beds. Why? 

**REPORTER:** You have caused far more damage to Azerbaijan during the 1st war than many others who are on the wanted list. Why did they greet you and let you proceed?

**BABAYAN:** First of all, the agents are 30-year-old kids who could not have recognized me. Nobody checks passports. They check the vehicle trunk while you walk 15 meters before getting back into your car. 

Now everyone wonders why I'm not the last person leaving Nagorno-Karabakh. I said I would be the last person if they placed me in charge. They didn't. But when they behave like cattle and surrender the country... 

**REPORTER:** Please no insults.

**BABAYAN:** That's nothing. That's not enough for them. These people must answer for their actions. 

**REPORTER:** There was no agreement with Azerbaijan to let you through?

**BABAYAN:** No.

**REPORTER:** Other Nagorno-Karabakh officials complain about the inability to leave. They say even Russian peacekeepers can't help them.

**BABAYAN:** There are other methods for leaving. I can give them a hint.

**REPORTER:** You weren't concerned that the Azeri agent would identify and arrest you?

**BABAYAN:** No. I've already served in Azerbaijani prison. I can do it 5 more times as long as I know I pursue the right cause.

**REPORTER:** What happened in Nagorno-Karabakh? Let's start with the resignation of President Arayik Harutyunyan. 

**BABAYAN:** The 5th Department of Russian special services FSB had made a phone call to Arayik. This FSB department is tasked with overseeing the political affairs in the CIS. If you remember, shortly after the Ukraine war one of this department's ranking officials was placed under house arrest for failures. As a result of this department's incompetency, all 12 countries have downgraded or broken their relations with Russia over the past 20 years. 

The FSB called Arayik and told him that the FSB's other assets in Nagorno-Karabakh had reported that Arayik was cooperating with others [Arayik was reportedly personally open to the Western platform].

**REPORTER:** Who are the FSB's assets who reported Arayik to FSB?

**BABAYAN:** The former presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh. They told FSB they would be more loyal to them, so FSB organized the replacement of Arayik.

**REPORTER:** So Russia organized this operation.

**BABAYAN:** Yes. They also dispatched Ruben Vardanyan to Nagorno-Karabakh last year. Russia has just requested Vardanyan to be allowed to leave Nagorno-Karabakh. How come Russia is doing this? Didn't Vardanyan claim he wasn't a Russian agent when he first arrived? 

**REPORTER:** Tell us more about how they decided to remove Arayik.

**BABAYAN:** Arayik was one of them. They are the same team. He joined 3 former leaders and decided that it was best to appoint someone else. They invited me to Parliament at night to inform me that Azerbaijan had warned that they would attack had Stepanakert proceeded with the appointment of a new president.

**REPORTER:** So Azerbaijan gave a direct warning?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. But they said they planned on proceeding with the change anyway, and that they would carry the responsibility. So I asked them why they invited me at all if every political party except for ours had already decided the change would take place. They said they wanted me to promise there wouldn't be mass protests on the streets. 

Now our people are refugees. It's over. Is this team going to answer for their actions or not? Bako Sahakyan, Arkadiy Ghukasyan, Arayik Harutyunyan, Samvel Shahramanyan, and their MPs who voted in favor of the process must answer in the court.

Second. After one day of fighting, they released a statement urging Armenia to remove its army from Nagorno-Karabakh. But Armenia has no army there. What army is Armenia supposed to withdraw? 

**REPORTER:** Who wrote that text implicating Armenia?

**BABAYAN:** Russia. These idiots decided to cooperate. They also surrendered 100 tanks, 170 howitzers, multiple GRADs, TORs, and enough armament for an army. They gave it all to Azerbaijan without any damage. How is this not a crime? 

Now they criticize me for leaving Nagorno-Karabakh, for not standing next to them to carry responsibility for their criminal decisions. These criminals must be charged with crimes as soon as they step foot into Armenia.

We [Babayan's team] agreed with Azerbaijan that Nagorno-Karabakh would receive the status of an autonomous republic. There are 23 paragraphs written point-by-point. Azerbaijan agreed to that. People who passed this document back and forth through the NK-AZ border should come and testify about our negotiations with Azerbaijan. 

**REPORTER:** So there was an alternative? We could have avoided this war?

**BABAYAN:** Absolutely. We were given an opportunity to form an autonomous republic on the 4,400 km^2 areas of former NKAO. We could have our own national guard. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan gave its approval?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. 

**REPORTER:** Were you the negotiator?

**BABAYAN:** Through someone else. I sent my responses in written form. They agreed. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan agreed for Nagorno-Karabakh to have autonomy, local governing bodies, and a national guard?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. All of it. The regime committed a crime by rejecting. 

**REPORTER:** Did you inform the regime?

**BABAYAN:** They didn't even want to listen. They didn't even invite me for any meeting. They never invited me to any defense meetings during the last 15 days. They didn't like me because I was against changing the government. Good job! Now you are criminals who stole Nagorno-Karabakh's independence by scratching the election results. Today you are evacuating the population.

Armenia was spending $500M/year to help the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh live and prosper. Armenia gave everything. The regime in the end called Armenia a criminal with an army located inside Nagorno-Karabakh. Moreover, most of the heavy equipment they surrendered to Azerbaijan wasn't donated by Armenia. It's the weapons we captured from Azerbaijan during the 1st war. 

**REPORTER:** Under *your* agreement with Azerbaijan, what would be the fate of this equipment?

**BABAYAN:** To move them to Armenia but this was a paragraph that Azerbaijan disagreed with. They wanted us to destroy the equipment in place instead of sending it to Armenia. Out of 23 paragraphs, there were disagreements around only 3. This was one of them.

**REPORTER:** Why wasn't the regime open to your negotiation efforts?

**BABAYAN:** They adopted a maximalist stance. They wanted nothing less than full independence. They wanted to be treated as an ""equal party"". They ignored my calls to hold direct negotiations with Azerbaijan, while the opposition parties in Armenia called me a ""traitor"". 

The parties run by Kocharyan and Serj, and the regime in Nagorno-Karabakh were against doing trade with Azerbaijan through the Agdam route. Did the road open in the end or not? Did they surrender the country in the end or not?

Before they replaced Arayik, during a parliamentary session I informed them that my team was negotiating with Azerbaijan. Two days later these monkeys launched a defamation campaign saying *""None of it is realistic, Babayan is a liar""*. These are Russian spies and desantniks [Ruben Vardanyan].

They knew about the ongoing efforts but they were agents serving another state. You call them a [Russian] agent and they don't even deny being one. 

For 20 years they used the people to enrich themselves. Today the government of Armenia has an obligation to confiscate every property owned by them and distribute them to the refugees. Confiscate absolutely everything and resettle the refugees into their properties.

**REPORTER:** If the Russian FSB installed the new regime in Nagorno-Karabakh, why did they allow Azerbaijan to attack Nagorno-Karabakh? 

**BABAYAN:** What makes you believe Russia was capable of stopping the attack? Everything Azerbaijan has done against us in Nagorno-Karabakh was aimed at pushing Russia out of Nagorno-Karabakh. Everything was done to discredit Russia and to show that Russia was powerless. This is why I was insisting on DIRECT negotiations with Azerbaijan, without Russian mediation. 

It was a massive mistake not to accept the status of an autonomous republic. This would have been an opportunity for AM-AZ normalization and trade resumption. But these ջահելs wanted to *""fight until the end""*.

**REPORTER:** What was Ruben Vardanyan's role? 

**BABAYAN:** The blockade of Lachin began after the landing of Ruben Vardanyan in Nagorno-Karabakh. This answers your question on why Russia couldn't prevent the September 19 attack. Azerbaijan interpreted Vardanyan's landing as an attempt by Russia to freeze the conflict, which Azerbaijan would never agree to under any conditions. They also viewed the coup as an attempt by Russia to freeze the conflict.

**REPORTER:** Why did Russia want to freeze the conflict?

**BABAYAN:** To maintain influence in the region, over Armenia and Azerbaijan. The new regime didn't believe Azerbaijan would launch a massive attack. Many in Armenia also didn't. They all believed the Russian peacekeepers wouldn't allow that. They ignored my pleas and warnings that Azerbaijan was preparing to attack. They bribed and brainwashed the population with the help of their owners in Yerevan. Serj Sargsyan was the first person to publicly congratulate the new president of Nagorno-Karabakh. Will Serj agree to share the responsibility for this surrender? These people are Russian spies working for FSB's 5th department. They have different interests. 

**REPORTER:** What does the opposition want in Armenia?

**BABAYAN:** They will try to use the refugees to remove Pashinyan. I'd like to ask refugees not to serve any political force. We must focus on finding housing and jobs for them.

**REPORTER:** Is Russia actively helping the opposition to remove Pashinyan?

**BABAYAN:** I don't know, ask them. Many of them don't even realize they are being used by FSB. They are asked to do certain things by agents who report to FSB. We must provide assistance to refugees so they will feel secure and less likely to become a political tool in the hands of the opposition or the government.

**REPORTER:** If Azerbaijan wants to discredit Russia by attacking Armenians to show Russia is useless, how come Russia isn't taking any action against Azerbaijan?

**BABAYAN:** Russia has always tried to avoid a confrontation with Azerbaijan, from day one. Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey. 

**REPORTER:** Why did this all happen?

**BABAYAN:** Greed. It's all over. The government is burning all the documents in Stepanakert. It's very convenient. They don't have to explain how they spent $1B in Himnadram donations. No one can audit anymore. 

**REPORTER:** There are no archives?

**BABAYAN:** They are burning everything. Everyone in Stepanakert already knows that the fire won't stop for 5 days. They've been burning documents since last week. 

**REPORTER:** They are burning it so Azerbaijan won't take possession of them.

**BABAYAN:** That's a good excuse. They are getting rid of records of financial loans taken from the Himnadram fund. It's understandable they'd want to purge military or other sensitive records but what does Himnadram have to do with it? Anyways. There must be an investigation launched by Armenian authorities. //

##residents of Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert are forced to collect water with buckets: PHOTOS

Azerbaijan has shut down the delivery of electricity and gas to Nagorno-Karabakh, in addition to food supplies, making it impossible for some critical utility companies to function. Giant water buckets were installed in several districts of the capital. The garbage collection was suspended earlier this month.

##interview with international analyst Richard Giragosian

**REPORTER:** Why is the U.S. delaying the approval of military aid to Azerbaijan?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** I was part of the team working on the law to ban military aid to Azerbaijan in the 1990s. It was drafted in response to Azerbaijan's aggression and the blockade of Armenia. Today we're witnessing another aggression, and this time the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The ban was later weakened, allowing the U.S. presidents to bypass it. This year, however, the U.S. president isn't eager to bypass the ban. It's usually approved in June. Now it's August. There are three possible factors:

(1) The U.S. doesn't have a lot of leverage over Azerbaijan. The suspension of military aid is a rare example. 

(2) Azerbaijan is no longer as important for the U.S. military after its withdrawal from Afghanistan. This also deprives Azerbaijan of Pentagon's support in Washington. 

(3) The most interesting factor. The U.S. is disappointed at Azerbaijan over the lack of diplomatic progress during the latest negotiations between AM-AZ foreign ministers in Washington. The U.S. was expecting more from Azerbaijan. 

These aren't enough to sway Azerbaijan, however. 

**REPORTER:** Almost all UN Security Council states have acknowledged the humanitarian crisis caused by the blockade of the Lachin corridor. Calls were made for Azerbaijan or both sides to ensure free movement in and out of the region. Critics say the Western calls are pointless because they are being ignored by Azerbaijan. What was the benefit of the UNSC session?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** The UNSC session was very important, but not for the reasons you may think. This was a move by Armenia to initiate the gradual diplomatic isolation of Azerbaijan. This changes the dynamic. For the first time, Azerbaijan has found itself defending against Armenia's diplomatic initiative. This is very important, but still insufficient, so I have two suggestions for the Armenian government:

(1) The threat of withdrawing from the peace negotiations could be very effective for Armenia. The negotiations are set to resume in September. Perhaps Armenia could withdraw from it unless Azerbaijan lifts the blockade.

(2) Study the U.S. history during the Cold War. The U.S. faced an 11-month-long blockade of Berlin. In the end, the West opened an air corridor. This is an important precedence.

**REPORTER:** During the UNSC session, Russia defended the position of Turkey and Azerbaijan. The statements made by these three countries were quite similar. It is obvious now that Russia has sold out its former ally Armenia. On the other hand, we saw the emergence of new diplomatic allies in the West.

**GIRAGOSIAN:** There are some disagreements within the RU-TR-AZ alliance. The RU-TR ties have weakened since the re-election of Erdogan. Azerbaijan has chosen a very risky path by publicly humiliating Russia. Kremlin has a long memory and won't forget or forgive this. Today, Russia's primary goal is to save its face. Russia supports the Aghdam road because they have been humiliated and incapable of enforcing the Nov. 9 agreement. Russia, Turkey, and Azerbaijan act from positions of insecurity, not confidence. At the same time, Armenia is building bridges to India and China. Also, Armenia has successfully avoided becoming an area of confrontation between the West and Russia.

**REPORTER:** Describe the AM-US relations. Is it getting stronger?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** What we are seeing is a change in policy by the U.S., not Armenia. The Biden administration wants to strengthen Armenia and the strategic role of democratic Armenia. The U.S. is no longer trying to *promote* democracy, it is trying to *defend* democracy. The U.S. ambassador has once again visited Syunik and Vayots Dzor and made a statement. But it would be a mistake for Armenia to overestimate the importance of the U.S. The EU likely plays a more important role here.

**REPORTER:** Will there be another major war soon?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Today we have a Game of Thrones-esque medieval siege of Nagorno-Karabakh. There is a manmade crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh caused by Azerbaijan, targeting the peaceful population. This is about the peace negotiations between AM-AZ. The most concerning part is not the peace agreement or the negotiation process, but the enforcement of the peace agreement. Are there guarantees that Azerbaijan won't break the agreement? Because it is beneficial for the Aliyev regime to continuously have an external enemy.

**REPORTER:** Is Armenia doing enough to strengthen its army by acquiring modern weapons and drones?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Not enough. Armenia is still too weak to match the Turkey-backed Azerbaijan. Armenia should prioritize quality over quantity, professionalism and modernization over the acquisition of the cheapest weapons from unreliable Russia. The Armenian government's decision to sign a large arms deal with India was great news.

What concerns me is the murder incidents within the army and the poor quality of relations between the soldiers. This problem, inherited from the previous governments, is still present. There is a lack of discipline in the army. A generational investment is necessary to improve military education and preparedness. 

The future is on Armenia's side, not Azerbaijan's. But real results will require several years of hard work.

**REPORTER:** In response to your statement that the Aliyev regime will always need an external enemy. The political situation in Azerbaijan is not improving, and human rights are being viciously violated. This has led to the emergence of more and more Azeri activists who aren't afraid of speaking up. Some are even critical of Aliyev's militaristic policies and lack of true desire to establish peace with Armenia. Could this lead to a change in Azerbaijan's foreign policy?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Changes within Azerbaijan are inevitable, but most of them could be negative for Armenia. We see that Azerbaijan is not satisfied with its 2020 victory. It was dangerously unsatisfactory for them. 

As for the Aliyev regime, Aliyev has adopted a nationalist stance and lies between the competing pro-Russian and pro-Turkish factions. For now, this is being successfully used as a distraction from the government's corruption and the lack of democracy, but this cannot last forever. 

We witnessed the beginning of the tipping point a few weeks ago, with the arrests of several pro-Aliyev figures, civil society activists, former peace activists, and former moderates. Aliyev's regime is now turning against its own people even in the conditions of the confidence brought by the victory.

Azerbaijan could plunge into a period of internal unrest and weakness. There is a 1990s precedence. There is the presence of a Turkey-backed defense minister with dangerous ambitions.

Azerbaijan will implode. It is a matter of ""when"". Armenia, the West, and Russia must analyze the consequences of the inevitable instability in Azerbaijan.

**REPORTER:** Armenia is attempting to normalize relations with Turkey but the latter refuses, and demands the normalization of AM-AZ relations as a precondition. What are the prospects?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Turkey has made it clear that it cannot make any move that would harm its relations with Azerbaijan. But Turkey is very dissatisfied with its own weakness towards dominant Azerbaijan. Today, Azerbaijan is the #1 foreign direct investor in Turkey. Azerbaijan has leverage during the economic hardship in Turkey.

Turkey is concerned over the possibility of an AZ-RU conflict in the region. 

Armenia has become more important for Turkey after the latest elections in Turkey, because Russia has essentially excluded Turkey from trade and transport restoration projects. Regulating relations with Armenia is the only way for Turkey to restore its regional role in the economy and trade.

Turkey is not as strong as before. The developments with Greece and Cyprus indicate that this is the era of Turkey's aging, weaker leadership. Turkey is more vulnerable today. Turkey's military aid to Azerbaijan is also not at the same level as before, and Aliyev turns to his friend Netanyahu more often these days. There is more friction that's below the surface.

##artificial snow will be used for Armenia's new ski resort 

[Last year we learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/tgibhu/mar172022_new_armenian_ski_resort_to_compete_with/) about plans to build a new ski/leisure resort in Armenia that will compete against Georgian and Russian counterparts.

According to Economy Minister Kerobyan, 28 km of ski tracks have already been laid. The second branch of the gondola elevator is under construction. The artificial snow-making system, the first in Armenia, is being installed and will be operational this year. ""The project will change the quality of life in nearby villages.""

The MYLER company will invest $78m in the first stage. Hotels, golf courses, a casino, restaurants, and other infrastructure will be built later.

The resort aims to attract 500,000 tourists from Russia, Iran, and Europe.

This is very important, but still insufficient, so I have two suggestions for the Armenian government:

(1) The threat of withdrawing from the peace negotiations could be very effective for Armenia. The negotiations are set to resume in September. Perhaps Armenia could withdraw from it unless Azerbaijan lifts the blockade.

(2) Study the U.S. history during the Cold War. The U.S. faced an 11-month-long blockade of Berlin. In the end, the West opened an air corridor. This is an important precedence.

**REPORTER:** During the UNSC session, Russia defended the position of Turkey and Azerbaijan. The statements made by these three countries were quite similar. It is obvious now that Russia has sold out its former ally Armenia. On the other hand, we saw the emergence of new diplomatic allies in the West.

**GIRAGOSIAN:** There are some disagreements within the RU-TR-AZ alliance. The RU-TR ties have weakened since the re-election of Erdogan. Azerbaijan has chosen a very risky path by publicly humiliating Russia. Kremlin has a long memory and won't forget or forgive this. Today, Russia's primary goal is to save its face. Russia supports the Aghdam road because they have been humiliated and incapable of enforcing the Nov. 9 agreement. Russia, Turkey, and Azerbaijan act from positions of insecurity, not confidence. At the same time, Armenia is building bridges to India and China. Also, Armenia has successfully avoided becoming an area of confrontation between the West and Russia.

**REPORTER:** Describe the AM-US relations. Is it getting stronger?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** What we are seeing is a change in policy by the U.S., not Armenia. The Biden administration wants to strengthen Armenia and the strategic role of democratic Armenia. The U.S. is no longer trying to *promote* democracy, it is trying to *defend* democracy. The U.S. ambassador has once again visited Syunik and Vayots Dzor and made a statement. But it would be a mistake for Armenia to overestimate the importance of the U.S. The EU likely plays a more important role here.

**REPORTER:** Will there be another major war soon?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Today we have a Game of Thrones-esque medieval siege of Nagorno-Karabakh. There is a manmade crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh caused by Azerbaijan, targeting the peaceful population. This is about the peace negotiations between AM-AZ. The most concerning part is not the peace agreement or the negotiation process, but the enforcement of the peace agreement. Are there guarantees that Azerbaijan won't break the agreement? Because it is beneficial for the Aliyev regime to continuously have an external enemy.

**REPORTER:** Is Armenia doing enough to strengthen its army by acquiring modern weapons and drones?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Not enough. Armenia is still too weak to match the Turkey-backed Azerbaijan. Armenia should prioritize quality over quantity, professionalism and modernization over the acquisition of the cheapest weapons from unreliable Russia. The Armenian government's decision to sign a large arms deal with India was great news.

What concerns me is the murder incidents within the army and the poor quality of relations between the soldiers. This problem, inherited from the previous governments, is still present. There is a lack of discipline in the army. A generational investment is necessary to improve military education and preparedness. 

The future is on Armenia's side, not Azerbaijan's. But real results will require several years of hard work.

**REPORTER:** In response to your statement that the Aliyev regime will always need an external enemy. The political situation in Azerbaijan is not improving, and human rights are being viciously violated. This has led to the emergence of more and more Azeri activists who aren't afraid of speaking up. Some are even critical of Aliyev's militaristic policies and lack of true desire to establish peace with Armenia. Could this lead to a change in Azerbaijan's foreign policy?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Changes within Azerbaijan are inevitable, but most of them could be negative for Armenia. We see that Azerbaijan is not satisfied with its 2020 victory. It was dangerously unsatisfactory for them. 

As for the Aliyev regime, Aliyev has adopted a nationalist stance and lies between the competing pro-Russian and pro-Turkish factions. For now, this is being successfully used as a distraction from the government's corruption and the lack of democracy, but this cannot last forever. 

We witnessed the beginning of the tipping point a few weeks ago, with the arrests of several pro-Aliyev figures, civil society activists, former peace activists, and former moderates. Aliyev's regime is now turning against its people even in the conditions of the confidence brought by the victory.

Azerbaijan could plunge into a period of internal unrest and weakness. There is a 1990s precedence. There is the presence of a Turkey-backed defense minister with dangerous ambitions.

Azerbaijan will implode. It is a matter of ""when"". Armenia, the West, and Russia must analyze the consequences of the inevitable instability in Azerbaijan.

**REPORTER:** Armenia is attempting to normalize relations with Turkey but the latter refuses, and demands the normalization of AM-AZ relations as a precondition. What are the prospects?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Turkey has made it clear that it cannot make any move that would harm its relations with Azerbaijan. But Turkey is very dissatisfied with its weakness towards dominant Azerbaijan. Today, Azerbaijan is the #1 foreign direct investor in Turkey. Azerbaijan has leverage during the economic hardship in Turkey.

Turkey is concerned over the possibility of an AZ-RU conflict in the region. 

Armenia has become more important for Turkey after the latest elections in Turkey, because Russia has essentially excluded Turkey from trade and transport restoration projects. Regulating relations with Armenia is the only way for Turkey to restore its regional role in the economy and trade.

Turkey is not as strong as before. The developments with Greece and Cyprus indicate that this is the era of Turkey's aging, weaker leadership. Turkey is more vulnerable today. Turkey's military aid to Azerbaijan is also not at the same level as before, and Aliyev turns to his friend Netanyahu more often these days. There is more friction that's below the surface.

##artificial snow will be used for Armenia's new ski resort 

[Last year we learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/tgibhu/mar172022_new_armenian_ski_resort_to_compete_with/) about plans to build a new ski/leisure resort in Armenia that will compete against Georgian and Russian counterparts.

According to Economy Minister Kerobyan, 28 km of ski tracks have already been laid. The second branch of the gondola elevator is under construction. The artificial snow-making system, the first in Armenia, is being installed and will be operational this year. ""The project will change the quality of life in nearby villages.""

The MYLER company will invest $78m in the first stage. Hotels, golf courses, a casino, restaurants, and other infrastructure will be built later.

The resort aims to attract 500,000 tourists from Russia, Iran, and Europe.

Also, let's not forget that there are millions of ethnic Azeris living in Iran. if they shoot a single bullet to azerbaijan, they will have to check the azerbaijani population in south azerbaijan.

What Iran is doing now, I think, is the steps it has taken towards domestic politics to keep its economically depressed people under control.

This is my opinion, do you think Iran will go to war?

11/14/2020,we fell victim to fake news on the Armenian side,"My insta was constantly flooded with news posts from Armenian groups saying great things each day about the war. So many people felt this was an even battle or that we had the upper hand. Our chant was #haghteluenq, wrong from the start. Winning what? We didn’t attack? It should have been Defend #bashbanenk While foreign journalists and news sources from around the world started showing the truth. The Armenians were not winning in fact losing fast. I tried telling people that reading Zartonk (ex) was just BS propaganda. The fact so many Armenians called out Azeris for fake news, while at the same time listening to complete false hopes was so hypocritical. I literally checked the maps uploaded daily by livecaucusesmap and each day we were hemorrhaging land, at a rate I later researched was much faster than in the 1990s. Guys it’s not rocket science we fought 2020 Turkey not 1990 poor Azerbaijan. 
Moving forward we need these sources as Armenian companies to inform Armenians of the truth even if it’s bad. Fake news benefits no one it always causes problems. Why do Armenians feel betrayed right now ? Because for over a month they had not realized how bad our situation was and how one more week and we might as well never lived in artsakh. We’re lucky to have lost only shushi and not khankendi. 
Hold these accounts to better standards. Don’t listen to only Armenian sources but also the enemies, “Russia, Azerbaijan, turkey etc” . Learn from them as well and then look at international non biased sources."

There’s lots of reasons because there is so much information that we get which for 30 years we still have this issue. It would be interesting to hear from everyone. My reason is that our government which is a dictator government, hasn’t changed which means there is no progressive policies to make a change. Secondly, some people don’t look at both sides of facts before having an opinion.

Edit:
Thank you for the responses, everyone’s opinion is valid. It’s also important that we move away from our emotions and look at the reality of what’s happening. Genocides is a sensitive topic, we are sensitive about it and we usually bring up that issue in the conflict. It has already happened in both sides like in Sumgait pogrom and Khojaly, we must move on and avoid these atrocities. History can not repeat itself. I’ve also realized the importance of where the information you get and remember looking at tv channels owned by the government? They are mostly used for propaganda and whatever caused the issue and humanitarian crisis in NK right now is also by the environmental protestors. 

I actually know someone to some degree who went there and protested so I’m going to try and find out how and why he decided to go. I tried my best finding the cause of it but it’s hard to find the evidence. I can give updates in the thread for which I may create a new one.

Edit 2: I’ve posted in Azerbaijan thread about this issue, there you can get Azerbaijani opinion about it. I suggest avoid arguments but rather promote reasonable discussion for which you could understand why they think like that."

A lot of Turks deny it and still claim that they want peace between our countries, but they don't realize that accepting the genocide is required in order for peace to be possible. 

I am sorry for what my ancestors did. I am sorry for the Hamidian Massacres, I am sorry for the Adana Massacres, I am sorry for the September Days, I am sorry for the Armenian, Greek and Assyrian Genocides and I am sorry for denying them. And I hope that one day, our country can come to terms with it's past, and peace can be achieved."
2/15/2023,"Investigation Reveals: Los Angeles Police Infiltrated by Pakistani Regime Loyalists, Anti-Armenian Hate Fest","[Link to Article](https://islamism.news/2023/02/14/mef-investigation-reveals-los-angeles-police-infiltrated-by-pakistani-regime-loyalists/)

Since at least 2018, consul generals from three countries have come together at COP’s [invitation](https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3515858.html) to celebrate their close relations. The Azerbaijan-Pakistan-Turkey Brotherhood Celebration is billed as an opportunity for the Muslim-majority nations to acknowledge their collective values and interests – including their shared enmity for common geopolitical enemies.

On the occasion of the second tripartite [conference](https://www.facebook.com/436988513121935/posts/pfbid0qavxMWw7dFwpKcXZMEnidYANwMMtAcDAxEWybJ6PZc1GByQCgXmqQ6LaRWjXR1u3l/?mibextid=cr9u03) in 2019, leaders focused on “human rights violations” in Kashmir and the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, home to an Armenian majority breakaway state that Azerbaijan would invade just months later.

When the three consulates met again at the council’s [event](http://m.oananews.org/news.php?id=615225) in 2021, the anti-Armenian rhetoric only intensified. Only this time, senior officers overseeing multiple police jurisdictions were on hand, effectively endorsing views that are considered deeply offensive to the Armenian American community.

COP President Adnan Khan set the tone with a speech [declaring](http://m.oananews.org/news.php?id=615225): “the Armenian army has committed genocide against Azerbaijani people. The people of Pakistan demand justice for Azerbaijan,” he said, referring to recent fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh. “The destruction of houses of worship, the destruction of cities committed by the Armenian army has to be addressed, and the Armenian government has to be held accountable.”

Backed by Turkey, Azerbaijan launched a full-scale invasion in 2020 to reclaim the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Azerbaijan’s attack was [dubbed](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/01/monumental-loss-azerbaijan-cultural-genocide-khachkars) “the worst cultural genocide of the 21stcentury.”

Nevertheless, the consul generals of Azerbaijan and Turkey attending the 2021 conference also took turns [beating up on Armenia](https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3515858.html). Azerbaijan Consul General Nasimi Aghayev deplored Armenia’s “barbaric occupation” of Artsakh and accused it of desecrating mosques by turning them into “pigsties and cowsheds.”

Top-ranking [officers](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid02cXfsS7TbSPshmWfcpuoYMLyS7PqKN9MHimHqJ8Coo3oCAYdPAVnK4gPq5iChUVWFl&id=699339593597012&mibextid=qC1gEa) from LASD and smaller police departments in Hawthorne and Inglewood were treated to a [screening](https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3515858.html) of an Azerbaijani state propaganda film called *Cultural Genocide in the Caucuses: The Worst Cultural Genocide of the 21st* *Century*. They were [joined](https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3515858.html) by leaders of the Islamic Center of Inglewood, a local mosque that was part of a 2005 terrorist recruitment [case](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/220957.pdf) involving three of its [congregants](https://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/testimony/391.pdf).

Mosque leaders, who also happen to serve on COP’s board of directors, [provided](https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3515858.html) a one-sided account of a recent state-sponsored trip to Azerbaijan. They described stops at “liberated cities” captured by Azerbaijani troops inside Nagorno-Karabakh.

In fact, COP makes a habit of attending similar anti-Armenian events. A [2019 event](https://www.facebook.com/pakistancouncilusa/posts/pfbid0jTXJz76WzQSLqgVFB9mSRoea1xbhCqzhPXm9bfQZ5akMaUox3BNR1M5xdzQxyKnvl) hosted by a prominent local [Islamist leader](https://www.investigativeproject.org/276/muzammil-the-moderate), and a [2021 meeting](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid027vzFPzYZMqsMRhmYUdJo8YA2Rj2mesBjUxgXvdRzWfJJCaVBArTweVE3uEpShYgDl&id=699339593597012&mibextid=qC1gEa) with Azerbaijani and Pakistani diplomats, were each organized to disparage Armenia and accuse it of the worst human rights offenses. While these divisive events escaped notice from local Armenians, Sheriff Villanueva was [forced to cancel](https://armenpress.am/eng/amp/1024850) an August 2020 forum scheduled to “discuss concerns with the Azerbaijani American community” after facing a backlash from local Armenian leaders.

The presence of police leaders at events that inflame decades-old tensions between diaspora communities has the potential to foment violent unrest. Case in point: on July 21, 2021, LA police were forced to break up [clashes](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jgX3XHjkIJs) outside the Consulate of Azerbaijan, where Armenian Americans were gathered to protest Azerbaijani military aggression.

Responding to the violence, COP issued a [press release](https://myemail.constantcontact.com/-Armenian-hate-groups-target-Azerbaijanis-in-United-States--Call-your-Congress-member-and-tell-them-we-need-to-act-and-stop-viol.html?soid=1128481767310&aid=-Meco7xLayw&mibextid=Zxz2cZ) that blamed the Armenian community for the violence, citing “demon-inspired hate speech” and “barbarism” from the Armenian side."

Babayan has been in favor of holding direct talks with Azerbaijan without a third party, whereas the government of Nagorno-Karabakh wants an international party to be present. Azerbaijan recently refused to hold a dialogue with Nagorno-Karabakh under an international format.

**REPORTER:** Describe the current mood in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**BABAYAN:** The population has become disheartened by the government's inaction over the past two months [since the launch of the total blockade by Azerbaijan]. Now there is an agreement between several parties to exit their basements and ""unite"".

**REPORTER:** The representative of [smallest opposition party] ARF was elected as the leader of Parliament [with the help of President Arayik Harutyunyan's ruling party]. The ruling party continues to ignore your party, despite it being the largest opposition party. Why?

**BABAYAN:** These political parties drove Nagorno-Karabakh to its current state with their actions over the past 20 years. It's the same individuals today, except for one or two. They are terrified of the thought that our party can come to power. 

These 4 parties have now united. So far we are patiently waiting. At the end of the day, the public must realize that their indifference is what allows the government to get away with inaction.

These forces are controlled from elsewhere: their clans in Armenia, foreign countries, etc. They are doomed to fail, however. The more games they play, the worse it will get.

**REPORTER:** Are they afraid of vendetta and losing more than their wealth if you come to power? 

**BABAYAN:** That's what their propaganda says but I have no desire to imprison anyone.
The truth is, they understand that very soon nothing will depend on them anymore, they will be forced to surrender power. They must understand that it is a big crime not to take steps to resolve the ongoing crisis. Imprisonment in the future could be warranted in the event of inaction today. 

**REPORTER:** What can the government do? They have agreed to meet in a 3rd country but the proposal was rejected by Azerbaijan. You also support holding a dialogue with Azerbaijan. What's the difference between the proposals made by you and the government?

**BABAYAN:** First of all, the government is still saying ""We must fight"". To fight, they have to contact international institutions and courts to initiate certain procedures, which they aren't doing. They are incapable of ""fighting"".

If you aren't going to ""fight"", then why don't you sit down and talk with Azerbaijan? They say a 3rd party must be present. But Azerbaijan disagrees. So there are two options: 1) Hold a dialogue with Azerbaijan without a mediator. 2) Tell the public that ""we are going to fight"" and ""those of you who aren't ready to fight should leave the country now"".   

I support the former. We must prepare a package of humanitarian topics and send it to Azerbaijan. If the latter agrees, we can meet and discuss confidence-building measures. A year or two later we can discuss political issues.

**REPORTER:** So you support direct talks without a 3rd party?

**BABAYAN:** Of course. We have enough problems as is, we don't need a 3rd party to enter and try to solve its own issues through this process.

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh government says without a 3rd party presence Azerbaijan will attempt to subjugate Nagorno-Karabakh.

**BABAYAN:** That's the mentality of a weak politician who isn't confident in his negotiation skills. If you know what you're doing, you won't allow Azerbaijan to subjugate you through that dialogue. Prepare the papers. Send them to Baku. If the dialogue fails, *only then* you can claim that the only outcome of that dialogue is becoming an ethnic minority within Azerbaijan. 

**REPORTER:** Azeris hate you for your military background. What makes you think they will agree to talk to you?

**BABAYAN:** Nobody said I should be the negotiator. I said prepare the documents now. You can send Poghos or Petros to negotiate it. Also send a team of experts to discuss the economy, transportation, etc. 

**REPORTER:** Describe the content of the proposal you want to send to Azerbaijan.

**BABAYAN:** For example, recording our existence as a separate unit/entity. We must understand what Azerbaijan's true intentions are. Don't get ahead of yourself, go talk to them first. If Azerbaijan displays nonconstructive behavior, at least you'll have peace of mind that you tried to resolve it diplomatically.

**REPORTER:** And if Azerbaijan rejects? 

**BABAYAN:** We physically defend ourselves to make them understand that diplomacy is the best option.

**REPORTER:** What's the likelihood of a major NK-AZ war at this stage? 

**BABAYAN:** Unlikely. Both sides would sustain heavy losses. I don't recommend that.

**REPORTER:** Azeris would sustain heavy losses?

**BABAYAN:** Undoubtedly. These aren't your southern flatlands anymore. These are mountains and forests. It will be very cruel. Not recommended.

**REPORTER:** In your last interview you stated that the government of Nagorno-Karabakh had secretly negotiated with Azerbaijan the removal of dozens of military equipment from Nagorno-Karabakh. But this claim was denied by them.

**BABAYAN:** They didn't deny that. One person denied that he was the one who prepared the list of military equipment. He said it was drafted by the defense ministry. I have that list in my hand. It can be published if necessary. They removed lots of equipment and transported it to Armenia. Another 56 units were supposed to be removed but weren't.

You know what's funny? Immediately after the war, our government imported all sorts of goods - including food and construction materials - through the Aghdam road with the help of Russians, held talks with Azerbaijan, discussed the use of the Sarsang reservoir, etc. 

Somehow, today it's ""treason"" when I urge them to hold dialogue with Azerbaijan. ""Babayan wants us to integrate into Azerbaijan."" Listen, my lovely dummies, it's the same thing you've been doing over the past 3 years. What are you talking about now? Why are you screaming like a virgin? 

They are funny people. Is it news to them that they've been importing goods from Aghdam and negotiating over Sarsang? Babayan wasn't there when they were doing that...

**REPORTER:** It seems you are being criticized regardless of what you propose. When you propose taking steps to ""fight"" [in international institutions], they accuse you of attempting to deteriorate the situation and launch another armed conflict. When you propose holding a dialogue instead, they accuse you of attempting to integrate Nagorno-Karabakh into Azerbaijan. Why?

**BABAYAN:** It's a sickness. The people in power don't want to assume any responsibility. They are going to drive us off the cliff within the next 2 months. They will surrender our country to Azerbaijan just like we did Kars, then claim ""we had no other option"". They will soon be forced to tell the population to leave the country, but they won't admit it was their fault. 

**REPORTER:** Do you have regular conversations with President Arayik?

**BABAYAN:** Yes, under the President-Opposition Party format. But starting today, with the appointment of the ARF MP as the Parliament leader, I will only hold face-to-face meetings with him. No more ""political consultations"". It is pointless to work with parliamentary parties anymore because them getting together and making this appointment indicates that from now on, everything they bring to Parliament is a waste of time to discuss because it has already been ""decided"" elsewhere [referring to the Republic of Armenia opposition controlling the Nagorno-Karabakh opposition and directing their moves remotely]. I wish them good luck. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan proposes the use of the Aghdam road and uses that for its propaganda. Should we discuss or accept its use?

**BABAYAN:** Our proposal includes the use of Lachin and [Aghdam] roads for economic activities. We propose the creation of a Sadakhlo-esque market in Nagorno-Karabakh that will have goods imported from Armenia and Azerbaijan. The consumers will choose which country's product they want to buy.

**REPORTER:** We used to have a similar market on the Armenia-Azerbaijan-Georgia border. Everyone would bring their goods to the common market. Is that the model you envision?

**BABAYAN:** Today, no resident of Nagorno-Karabakh can safely cross the border, go to Azerbaijan's Aghdam, and buy products from there. Therefore, we must create a market right on the Askeran-Aghdam border. They can have a dispatcher with the list of Azeri companies that can supply goods. The goods can be stored and processed by a lab for quality and safety checks. A small business owner then purchases products from this market for resale. If you're a super-patriot, don't act like a clown now, just buy the Armenian product, no one will force you to buy the Azeri. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan wants to hold a dialogue in Yevlakh or Baku [both in Azerbaijan]. Would you accept that?  

**BABAYAN:** I don't care about the location of the meeting. First, we must draft a document and send it to Azerbaijan so we'll know what types of topics will be discussed so we'll know whom to send. 

If the spineless government is unwilling to execute this plan, it must resign and stop torturing the population.

**REPORTER:** What are your expectations from the government of Armenia?

**BABAYAN:** To provide socio-economic support and promote the idea of ""one nation, two states"".

##Nagorno-Karabakh President Arayik Harutyunyan's emergency message: 

As we speak, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh are being subjected to genocide. They are on the brink of destruction and losing their homeland. 

The only road that connects Nagorno-Karabakh to the external world, the road that travels through the Lachin Corridor and connects to Armenia, has been blocked by Azerbaijan since December 2022. 

The closure began as a fake environmental protest. It turned into an official policy by the state of Azerbaijan in April 2023 when they installed an illegal checkpoint. 

On 15 June they completely shut it down, launching a total siege against Nagorno-Karabakh and its 120,000 residents. 

For 8 months the population hasn't been able to move freely, and for 2 months the Red Cross and peacekeepers haven't been able to import food and other necessities. 

Azerbaijan's actions are against international law, the legally binding World Court ruling, the November 9 statement, and the European human rights court.

Azerbaijan's goal is to systemically exterminate the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. It is the continuation of their 2020 military aggression during which they received assistance from Turkey and terrorist cells from the Middle East.

Azerbaijan wants to use force to deprive the people of Nagorno-Karabakh of their right to self-determination. The most important guarantee for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to preserve its identity, rights, culture, and development is the recognition of it as a state, as an international legal subject.

Azerbaijan failed to physically remove every Armenian resident of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020, so they are pursuing the same goal through non-military means today. The illegal checkpoint on Lachin has already led to the arrest of our citizen Vagif Khachatryan, who was kidnapped by Azeri soldiers from the Red Cross convoy.

Now Azerbaijan is offering false choices, supposedly to ease the humanitarian crisis, which they are responsible for. They are trying to promote the narrative that Nagorno-Karabakh has to rely on foreign aid and that they are willing to ""aid"" Nagorno-Karabakh. In reality, they are starving Nagorno-Karabakh to forcefully subjugate it. Their offer to use the Aghdam road is part of their criminal plan.

Azerbaijani officials aren't even hiding that their goal is the expulsion of the indigenous Armenian population from their homeland. 

The Stepanakert-Baku dialogue proposed by Azerbaijan is, in reality, an attempt by Azerbaijan to legitimize its criminal policies. Any calls to hold a meeting with Azerbaijan without a mediator and guarantees is an encouragement to Azerbaijan's genocidal policies.

For the negotiations to be effective and legitimate, it is necessary to ensure that the sides follow international norms. Azerbaijan has been violating these norms with impunity. Nagorno-Karabakh, on the other hand, has been in favor of holding productive and fair negotiations.

We must first create favorable and equal conditions for negotiations to take place, then discuss the international mechanism that will have the mandate to mediate the negotiations. Without this, while having one side that wants to destroy the other at any cost, there can be no dialogue.

International institutions have demanded Azerbaijan to reopen the Lachin Corridor but no actions have been taken yet. Experts have also weighed in, and the first Prosecutor at ""International Criminal Court"" Luis Moreno-Ocampo has made a statement.

##... our message:

(1) Armenia should immediately ask the UN Security Council to discuss and adopt a resolution regarding the illegal closure of the Lachin Corridor and the genocidal siege.

(2) Use every available platform to raise awareness.

(3) Our international colleagues should sanction Azerbaijan.

(4) I urge the Armenian government and others to refrain from making statements that question Nagorno-Karabakh's right to self-determination.

(5) Diasporans should ask their governments and NGOs to pressure Azerbaijan. 

(6) Russian peacekeepers should multiply efforts to immediately end the blockade and follow the Nov. 9 statement.

(7) Russia, the U.S., and France being the OSCE trio and members of UNSC, should take immediate steps to force Azerbaijan to end the blockade, and to restore the international negotiation mechanism.

(8) UNSC members should discuss Azerbaijan's genocidal policies and adopt a resolution forcing them to end the blockade, as ruled by the UN World Court. Preventing genocide is the collective responsibility of the international community.

(9) UN General Secretary should use the system at its full to put an end to this crime. His secretaries should present the information they've received, containing facts about Azerbaijan's genocidal policies. Send a fact-finding mission to Nagorno-Karabakh.

(10) UN's human rights and refugee program leaders should provide an assessment of the ongoing crisis.

(11) Red Cross is the only international organization with a presence in Nagorno-Karabakh. I urge them to share the facts with international organizations and UNSC member states. 

(12) European Council should take steps to implement the ECHR's 21 Dec 2022 verdict. With so many violations of the fundamental pillars, they should consider Azerbaijan's expulsion from the Council.

(13) EU should use its resources and tools, including sanctions, to pressure Azerbaijan to end the mass violation of human rights. I urge the EU to stay true to its values. Refrain from placing Azerbaijan's oil above human rights.

(14) To other international actors: Join the awareness campaign and ask your governments to take steps to end the crisis.

(15) To the international press: Your mission to inform the world is an important one. Break the unacceptable silence. Provide the world with factual information about Azerbaijan's crimes.

(16) To the world: Nagorno-Karabakh is the *only* place in the world today that's under a total blockade, where the international community is fully barred from accessing. Don't you wonder why Azerbaijan is doing this against the peaceful population of Nagorno-Karabakh? 

Nagorno-Karabakh is not a ""grey zone"" anymore, it is a ""black hole"". Here you can witness every crime against humanity. This impunity to carry out genocide will give birth to more crimes, perhaps someday against your own people. I ask and demand everyone to act to prevent this ongoing genocide until it's completely too late.

##Armenia's new nuclear power plant || What are the problems with Russian and large-capacity reactors? || U.S. offers a low-interest loan for construction || Interview with the director of HayAtom 

**REPORTER:** Metsamor NPP expires in 2036. When should we expect the new reactor to be ready?

**PETROSYAN VAHRAM:** Metsamor expires in 2026. There is an ongoing process to extend it until 2036. This type of reactor could be further extended until 2041. The structural integrity of the metal body is what defines how long you can extend its lifespan. During the most recent [and first] attempt we were able to restore the metal's properties by 80%. Along with Dutch experts, we've concluded that we can extend it until 2041, and that's a conservative estimate. That's plenty of time to build a new reactor. I'm part of the team formed by PM Pashinyan [a year ago] to discuss the selection and construction process. 

South Korea and France have offered their options. We will send an envoy to South Korea soon.

Russia offers large 1,000-1,200 MW blocks. They also have small 600-800 MW units but they are Fast Neutron Reactors with liquid metal coolers(?). These aren't as appealing for Armenia.

**REPORTER:** Can we afford to hire Russians to build reactors like the ones they build in Turkey recently?

**PETROSYAN:** Those are expensive 1,200 reactors. Russia builds them with Russian money, sets the price of electricity, and sells the electricity. Would this work in Armenia? I'm not sure because we have to consider the socio-economic issues and the possible price of that electricity.

But let's say we build a 1,200 reactor. What are we going to do with the excess power? If we have a functional grid that can export large volumes of electricity to Iran and Georgia, then this wouldn't be a bad option. We are currently building new power lines to connect to our neighbors. 

Russia says they can lower the 1,200's power by 50% but I don't consider it a normal option. Besides that, the 1,200 units are more difficult to cool and require taller cooling towers which require additional solutions to be earthquake-proof.

The U.S. offers quite interesting options, ranging from small to large capacities. The State Department recently invited our working group to the U.S. We visited the [presumably Oak Ridge] nuclear research laboratory in Tennessee. It's a large center where Albert Einstein used to work. We were given a tour to learn about their nuclear fuel, technologies, etc. 

They offered us a 300 MW boiling water reactor called ""BWR"". The first unit is still under work, it hasn't been licensed yet. The first one will be built after the 2030s. They plan on building those in Eastern European countries like Poland.

The U.S. is also offering us a 77 MW reactor by NuScale. It's a modular reactor, each one is 77. Six of them combined would be slightly above Metsamor. This is a compact new technology that has just been licensed but not yet built for commercial use. They hope to launch the first one in the U.S. in 2025, followed by the second one in Romania.

**REPORTER:** Russia is offering a large capacity which would allow us to export more, while the U.S. reactor would allow Armenia to diversify its energy source, to reduce reliance on Russia. What is the priority?

**PETROSYAN:** Our Group does not discuss political issues. We want the most technologically sound option and the one that will produce electricity that's cheap for Armenia.

**REPORTER:** Do you already know whose option will offer the cheapest electricity?

**PETROSYAN:** Approximately. We don't want the price to exceed 6.3 cents per kWh.

**REPORTER:** Will you ensure that the price of the new electricity is equal to or lower than the current price?

**PETROSYAN:** It won't be lower because the price of metal components keeps increasing, although, on the other hand, the cost of nuclear fuel could decrease thanks to new technologies that are being developed in Russia and elsewhere.

**REPORTER:** What's your personal opinion?

**PETROSYAN:** The U.S. is offering an [AP300](https://info.westinghousenuclear.com/news/westinghouse-launches-ap300-smr) that is also a pressurized water reactor. It is the modernized and reduced version of the larger AP1000 unit. If we can build two AP300, that will give us 600 MW. 
Transporting and retraining experts would be a challenge. We would need to purchase the fuel from Westinghouse. It is possible to produce cheap electricity. 

AP300 is very close to our Metsamor reactor. It's a similar environment despite some differences like the number of steam generators. Russia's 1,200 reactor is also similar to ours - more modern and more powerful.

Russia has made a price proposal but we sent it back and asked them to review the calculations. The numbers are confidential. We will review all the available options. The Government has instructed us to wrap up the process and present our suggestion by the end of this year so they can make the final decision.

**REPORTER:** Who will finance the construction if it's a U.S. or a Russian reactor?

**PETROSYAN:** Russia is attempting to offer some credits, the plan is not clear yet. As for the U.S., they want to offer a loan with a near-0% interest rate just so they can enter our region and become a player. 

**REPORTER:** Which reactor would be best suited for our grid?

**PETROSYAN:** Two units of AP300 reactors offered by the U.S.

**REPORTER:** If we choose a large Russian reactor, can we find a buyer for our excess electricity? Azerbaijan and Turkey are large producers, and Georgia is also exporting.

**PETROSYAN:** We are currently building two transmission lines: 400 kW to Georgia and one to Iran. We can sell electricity to Russia or elsewhere via Georgia. We would need to clarify this and sign export contracts in advance to ensure we have an export destination. Iran is a serious option. 

**REPORTER:** What happens if the new one is built before the expiration of Metsamor?

**PETROSYAN:** Metsamor will be shut down and decommissioned. This will be an expensive process.

**REPORTER:** Will you royally fuck this up and leave the plan on the paper?

**PETROSYAN:** I don't think so. Once we decide whose technology we'll be using, the rest will be more straightforward. The U.S. State Department is very serious about their offer. They expect a similar attitude from us.

2/23/2023,Which countries support Ukraine other than countries from Nato and EU?,Is there a chart or statistic where I can find this? I'm really curious.
1/21/2015,"CMV: Michael Moore and Seth Rogan's criticisms of the film""American Sniper"" are valid and the glorification of war is wrong.","I both comments dealt with the subjectivity of heroism. Michael Moore said that his uncle was killed by a sniper in wwii and that he was raised to think of snipers as cowards that shoot people in the back. That is just his relationship to the existence of snipers. I'm sure there are many Iraqis that now hate Chris Kyle and hate snipers. 

 Snipers have been portrayed as cowards in the past as well. The sniper scene in full metal jacket (a much better film) comes to mind, where the sniper shoots a man trying to rescue a wounded man. It is clear that snipers are a part of modern warfare but only as a necessity. I think it is valid to take a step back and question the heroism of snipers whether you agree or notim not saying Chris Kyle did killed people rescuing others but out brings up the topic of dehumanization that goes along with war. 

The film American sniper does a great job of honoring a noble man but it does not tackle the bigger issues of the Iraq war. The film at one point mentions that terrorists from other parts of the region are entering the country of Iraq to fight Americans. It doesn't explore the fact that Americans invaded the country based on false information about wmds.

With that said Michael Moore's tweet didn't address the fact that half way through the movie Chris Kyle realizes that sniping is cowardly and joins the front line. As an aside, if there's someone from the navy seals I'd like to know if Chris Kyle's repeated disobaying of orders and abandonment of posts would be considered wrong or not.

Seth Rogans tweet about the movie reminding him of the NAZI propaganda film from is not really as interesting to me because it is clearly just meant to be a funny observation that pokes fun of some likenesses to propaganda.

I think people get emotional about the Iraq war because they still connect it with America being attacked on 9/11 even though history has proven the connection to be incorrect. This is fact at this point and this film kind of tries to make an argument for the opposite. After learning the truth America stayed in Iraq for several years in and effort to stabilize the region but now with ISIS we are seeing that we actually the region.

The Iraq war was nowhere near the noble effort of defense that was world war ii but the film shows Chris Kyle sign up for the seals after seeing the US embassy be bombed in Kenya by Saudi terrorists coordinated by Osama bin Laden who was in Azerbaijan at the time. Chris Kyle was sent to Iraq to fight insurgents after  America failed to find the WMDs we thought were there. Chris Kyle was noble the military was not and we need to be open to criticism of the military because if we are not than tyranny with prevail."

Just wanted to know your opinion on these matters, as I saw pictures of mosques being desecrated and filled with cows, dirt and shit ( https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/j3w9cp/im_a_muslim_and_ive_stumbled_upon_these_pictures/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf ).

Inserting cows in a mosque just to push the propaganda is not good.

I’m Muslim of Azerbaijani ethnicity, so I will support Muslims fighting for **the right cause** and will condemn those who oppress them, but this seems like has nothing to do with Islam (especially given that my own people insert cows in mosques to push the propaganda like wtf)

11/27/2020,[South Azerbaijani Opinion] - Why Persians support Armenians and how they view Azerbaijanis,"As a South Azerbaijani with pure family roots in Tabriz. I wanted to make a post and encourage my Şomali qardaşlar that Iran is not to be trusted and that Iran will never be a friend of Azerbaijan or Azerbaijani peoples. I understand in the north that you are disconnected from Iran and do not know their sentiment towards you. One of the most common stereotypes in Iran is painting us as ""Turkish donkeys (Torke Khar)"". We are viewed as uneducated peasants who are socially 'lower' in comparison to Persians and untrustworthy peoples. 

In regards to trustworthiness, our patriotism and support for Iran have always been microscopically watched carefully, which has resulted in certain Azerbaijani figures from Iran overcompensating in their patriotism to appear loyal to the country they reside in and not to become victimized due to suspicion of being people who harbor separatist and anti-Iranian sentiment. As for being uneducated peasants, we are often portrayed in Persian cinema as the servant figures or low-class workers who speak Persian with thick Turkish accents. The state of Iran wants its Turkish Azerbaijani population to remain subservient and quiet, while it covertly Persianize our population. The Iranian state government even published a cartoon about us, where we were depicted as cockroaches: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/Iran_Azeri_Cartoon.png

Persians do not view us as equals and we do not maintain equal rights with Persians or other ethnic minorities in Iran. Non-Iranic ethnic minorities such as the Jews and Armenians, have the most amount of liberties granted to them. But even in comparison to other Iranic ethnic groups, Azerbaijanis have it the worst. The most notorious right that is rejected for our people, is the right to learn in our own mother-tongue. Iran recently has taken one good step, by allowing Azerbaijani to be learned as an elective course in universities... But in places such as Tabriz, Urmia, Ardabil, Khoy, etc. - you will be taught in Farsi and only in Farsi. All government and public institutions do not recognize the existence of the Azerbaijani language, unlike in Georgia and Dagestan for instance. 

I will now list (from my observations) the major reasons as to why Persian people support Armenia over Azerbaijani people. 

------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Azerbaijan historically belonged to Persia**

Persian nationalists are dismayed about the fact that they lost the Caucasus during the Qajar period in Persia. They however fixate on Azerbaijan, often ignoring the fact that Dagestan, Georgia and Armenia belonged to Persia. More or less acknowledging and allowing the self-determination of these peoples, but not Azerbaijan or Azerbaijanis, who they claim belong to ""Iran zamin"". 

**2. Turkification and Iranic Azari peoples**

Persian nationalists maintain the belief that Azerbaijanis are ethnically confused people who are buttering up to the wrong nation. They get angry over the fact that Azerbaijanis have excellent relations with Turkish people and espouse a common Turkic-Oghuz identity. They want Azerbaijanis to dispose of their current Turkic language and ""readopt"" an Indo-European Iranic language (funnily enough, an extinct one at that). 

They claim that the real Azerbaijanis identified as ""Azari"" peoples and spoke the ""Azari"" language. A language supposedly mutually intelligible with Talysh. That Azaris were an ethnic Iranic tribe that originated from the ancient Medes in Northwest Iran. 

This is a great insult and completely ignores the vast enormous cultural and linguistic contributions of the Turkoman tribes who settled in Azerbaijan. 

**3. Azerbaijani Threat to Territorial Integrity** 

There is growing concern within Persian circles, that if Azerbaijan is empowered and strengthened, that they will pose territorial claims and threatened the territorial integrity of Iran due to the fact that a large Azerbaijani population resides in Northwestern Iran. Iran is home to the largest Azerbaijani population and Tabriz was its historical capital. 

They view pan-Turkism as a threat due to these reasons, and often are under the delusions that Azerbaijani and Turkey are constantly scheming at partitioning South Azerbaijan from Iran. 

**4. Animosity and Jealousy** 

There is animosity, jealously and ignorance over the fact that many of the ""Persian"" dynasties throughout the past 1,000 years have been composed ethnically of Turkoman Turkic tribes (i.e. Qizilbash being the most notorious - Afshar, Shahsevan, Terekeme and Qajars being the most notorious and politically influential among these tribes).

**5. A division among Indo-European (Aryan ""Aryayee"") and nonIndo-European peoples**

Persians generally misunderstand and don't know much about Armenian people. They fail to realize that the vast majority of Armenians come from countries outside of Iran. Countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Russia, etc. They think Iranian Armenians are a reflection of all Armenian peoples. 

Persians however are under the assumption that Armenians are ethnically and culturally similar to Persian peoples in most regards. They also consider Armenians as their Indo-European, ""Aryayee"", kin who are somewhat related to Iranic peoples and that they should support Armenians against peoples who aren't Indo-European/Aryan (a.k.a Mongol in their minds).

------------------------------------------------------------

The fact of the matter is in the past 100 years, Azerbaijanis within Iran have attempted on two occasions to separate and create our own nation state (1920 Azadistan and 1945 Azerbaijan People's Government). If Persians had treated us with more respect and dignity we may not have attempted to have split from their nation. If they chose to view us as equals and respect our culture/language there would be no issues since we have many things in common rather than differences. 

Throughout the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war I have been insulted by my former Persian friends for supporting Azerbaijan against Armenia and called a traitor. I have also seen my former Persian friends donate to Armenian funds to support them against Russified ""fake Azaris"" (as they call you northerners) which has left me bewildered and insulted. It amazes me that our people fought valiantly to defend Iran and its territory throughout its history. Throughout the various past wars and in recent years against Saddam Hussein, where many of the soldiers who died for Iran were Azerbaijanis. At the end we are cockroach donkeys who need to throw our ethnic identity and language into the trash can... This I cannot stand for. 

I also wanted to add, do not to trust many of these Persian nationalists **who pretend to be ethnic Azerbaijanis** or partially ethnic ""Azari"". They do this to deceive other people and push their pro-regime or pan-Iranic propaganda. They usually have zero Azerbaijani roots, cannot speak the Azerbaijani language, cannot name any of the neighborhoods in the cities they claim they are from, do not know/understand the local dialects and have in general never sat foot in our Azerbaijan region."

**(Lack of ) Human Rights and Freedoms**

Gubad Ibadoglu, a prominent economist, Senior Visiting Fellow at LSE, and the chairman of ADPP (Azerbaijan Democracy and Prosperity Party), has been detained and accused of having connections with “FETO,” which Turkey considers a terrorist organization. On the photos shared on social media Gubad Ibadoglu was seen being forcibly apprehended alongside his wife and taken to the detention center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Ibadoghlu’s office was searched, and documents were confiscated. The six-hour-long search in his office eventually concluded, and when he was brought out from the office, authorities covered his face with a black curtain to prevent anyone from seeing him. He conveyed to journalists that “This is Ilham Aliyev‘s order.”

Ibadoglu’s wife Irada Bayramova who was also assaulted by the police, appealed to the public, calling for support. Her open letter says: Gubad Ibadoglu, chairman of the ADPP Party, was detained by the Main Directorate for Combating Organized Crime yesterday on the order of Ilham Aliyev. The government has fabricated yet another false narrative, accusing him of selling counterfeit money, and simultaneously, both Turkish and Azerbaijani media are maligning him as a FETO member. Both Gubad and I have endured violence. We bear injuries on our bodies, and we are unable to access his necessary medications! Gubad Bey is unwell and requires multiple medicines throughout the day. By not allowing him to have medications, they want to kill him! Please, everyone, protest! Take to the streets for Gubad Bey! Raise your voice! Don’t let them kill Gubad Ibadoglu, don’t let this government kill him!”

Ibadoghlu’s daughter Zhala Bayramova said that both her parents were beaten by the police during detention and they were not given any explanation. Bahramova’s Facebook post:  “[20 agents of ](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02xPAjoqmoWBSqwZ4hf2w9Emj5ADX4WCKe3EXe3zHsnVPj96xE2qxSgDfunqKw3k1dl&id=100094672197139)the Main Directorate for Combating Organized Crime got out of these cars and forcefully detained, beating up Mr. Gubad and his wife without introducing themselves. Mr. Gubad and his wife, Mrs. Irada, were put in separate cars and were taken to the MDCOC without any official warrant.” According to the statement given by Bayramova, the police allegedly discovered 40,000 dollars in her father’s office. Bayramova asserted that the money was planted by the police themselves.

Many view this arrest as nothing more than an orchestrated effort to silence one of the government’s critics and stifle dissenting voices.

Chairman of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party Ali Karimli condemned Ibadoghlu’s arrest, saying that he played a significant role in exposing the government’s corruption scheme in great detail. “[Gubad Bey is one of the persons who](https://www.facebook.com/karimliali/posts/pfbid02smpdGUYR1scHK43kHGZGefJHxeyUGpXEhjzHeWf9HjRbkjkq9j1Qr3Pvrjbdh26Sl) exposed the corruption scheme of the government. It is widely recognized among those familiar with the country’s political landscape that Gubad Bey’s arrest stems from his outspoken criticism, particularly his writings and speeches that have brought corruption to light. Given the widespread awareness of this fact, the government’s accusations against Gubad Bey appear unfounded and illogical to many in the country.”

According to reports from Azerbaijani pro-governmental media, an operation targeting FETÖ (Fethullahist Terrorist Organization) took place in Azerbaijan, leading to the arrest of four individuals. “Yeni Şafak,” a Turkish newspaper, disclosed that the detained individuals include Doyrush Jafarov, a former leader of FETO in Azerbaijan, Gümrah Abdurakhmanov, responsible for the organization’s financial affairs, Ruslan Aliyev, the director of the center called “Yurd,” and Anar Aliyev, who handles organizational affairs. The arrested FETO members are currently detained following court proceedings.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan has officially confirmed Ibadoghlu‘s arrest, stating that it was part of their operational measures against individuals linked to FETO within the country. During these measures, one of the five detained individuals mentioned having a connection with Ibadoglu. Subsequently, a search was conducted at Ibadoglu‘s office, during which documents crucial to the case were discovered, leading to his detention. The authorities are currently continuing their investigations as part of the ongoing measures.

Tofig Yagublu, a member of the National Council of Democratic Forces, asserted that Gubad Ibadoglu‘s arrest was a consequence of his exposure of corruption scandals involving the Aliyevs. “[The real reason for Gubad Ibadoglu’s arrest](https://www.facebook.com/tofiq.yaqublu/posts/pfbid0jQVZZ3Q8mdvvjZ2qPwAZcvyqkcRmGVdwyY3GxghzMbn7rMwZeny2Y77Haj1V84Tsl) is the public organization AGTF (Azerbaijani Youth Education Fund), which he co-registered in London together with professor Jamil Hasanli and former ambassador Arif Shahmarli. Currently, the organization is in the process of formation and has not yet commenced its activities. The Supreme Corruptor holds illegal assets worth billions of dollars in Great Britain. He is afraid that the British government might confiscate these illegal assets and allocate them to the this organization, which intends to operate transparently and in the best interests of the Azerbaijani people.” Yagublu attributes the arrests and allegations against Ibadoglu to baseless accusations aimed at discrediting him, labelling them as products of a government characterized by robbery, lack of education, and a lack of intelligence.

Azadlig newspaper reports that political prisoner Alizamin Salayev, stated that he experienced significant ill-treatment in prison. Salayev was on a hunger strike for more than a hundred days in protest against his illegal arrest and fake accusations.

Meydan TV reported that on July 22, Nizameddin Ibadov, a veteran of the Second Karabakh War took his own life by setting himself on fire himself in the yard of his residence in Mammadli settlement, Absheron region. According to his relatives, the 33-year-old veteran had been under treatment at Republican Psychiatric Hospital No. 1 for some time before being discharged just two days prior to the incident. While the exact reasons behind his decision to commit suicide are not yet known, there are indications of potential distress during his time at the hospital. The day before his tragic act, Nizamaddin Ibadov had a conversation with journalist Nurlan Libre, in which he disclosed that he had experienced torture while he was being treated at the hospital. He recounted, “They tortured me. They didn’t let my father in at all. When I met my father, they would open my hand for 2-3 minutes, allowing us to talk and meet. But as soon as I returned upstairs, they would immediately close my hand. In other words, my father didn’t get to see anything either.” There exists a recorded conversation with the journalist, in which Ibadov disclosed further disturbing details, stating, “They tied the hands and feet of 4-5 people… In addition, there are people who have been kept there for 15 or 8 years for no reason.”

Another war veteran, Amin Akif oglu Babayev made two suicide attempts recently. On July 22, Amin, a resident of Azafli village in Tovuz, tried to end his life by ingesting medicine. Fortunately, doctors were able to save him. However, the following day, July 23, Amin attempted suicide again by cutting his arms. Relatives of Amin Babayev informed Meydan TV that the reason behind his desperate actions was the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population’s failure to grant him a disability status. Despite having an iron prosthesis on his knee as a war veteran, Amin has been unable to obtain the disability recognition he rightfully deserves. This lack of acknowledgment has left him in distress and without the necessary support he needs for his condition.

During a meeting held at the Khatai District Court, a decision was made concerning the extension of the preventive detention measure imposed on the activist Bakhtiyar Hajiyev. Both Hajiyev and his lawyer requested the cancellation of the arrest warrant. However, the decision reached during the meeting resulted in an extension of Hajiyev‘s detention period by 2 months and 10 days. Bakhtiyar Hajiyev had been arrested in December of the previous year and is facing multiple charges under various articles of the Criminal Code, including hooliganism (221.2.2), contempt of court (289.1), illegal entrepreneurship (192), money laundering (193-1), and forgery of official documents (320.1).

**Governance and Corruption** 

On July 23, which marked National Press Day, a group of Azerbaijani journalists and activists collectively reached out to the governing bodies of the Council of Europe to express their profound concerns regarding the repercussions of the new media law, which came into effect in February 2022. The Venice Commission of the Council of Europe had previously raised objections in June 2022, stating that the “On Media” law contradicts the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, which safeguard the right to freedom of expression and media. Even before the law’s adoption, local experts had already voiced similar reservations. The Commission’s conclusion categorically stated that the law fails to meet the standards expected by the Council of Europe, making its application unacceptable for any member country. Since the implementation of this restrictive law, independent journalists have been barred from filming during events such as the demonstration in Saatli district on March 14, 2023, where people were demanding improvements in water supply, as well as the action in Söyudlü village, Gadabay, on June 20, 2023, addressing environmental concerns due to a gold deposit.

In their joint statement media representatives note that several state institutions have been unresponsive to information requests from journalists and media outlets not listed in the media register. In their petition, the signatories, including media representatives, journalists, media experts, and civil society activists, strongly urge the government of Azerbaijan to be reminded of its obligations as a member of the Council of Europe. They call for a revision of the “On Media” law to safeguard freedom of expression and media, avoiding any irreversible harm. If these concerns are not addressed adequately, the petition suggests the possibility of freezing Azerbaijan’s membership until the issues are resolved. The appeal has been directed to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, its Monitoring Committee, the human rights commissioner, and co-rapporteurs for Azerbaijan, signifying the seriousness and urgency of the matter at hand.

Director of the Baku Research Institute Altay Goyushov commented on the state of media in Azerbaijan, pointing out the concerning level of government control. Goyushov’s Facebook post: “[Television in Azerbaijan is entirely in the hands of the government](https://www.facebook.com/altaygoyushov/posts/pfbid02QVhDhxRC3ZL2FiFnWvvBu9r3oMjbcnYTj6gAJvDANcu1kuPHE6eUAYBgJMWhFmnvl), leaving no room for independent or dissident voices to have their channels or express critical opinions on existing platforms. Similarly, the print media in Azerbaijan has faced the same fate, with no independent or dissident publications surviving due to the oppressive tactics employed by the authorities and the overwhelming influence of oil money over the years. As a result, the print media has become a tool of unconditional propaganda, serving the government’s narrative. Until 2009, there were independent and critical radio channels operating on FM waves in Azerbaijan. However, in a bid to ensure President Aliyev’s re-election for the third time, these radio stations were also forcibly closed down, leaving the radio waves as yet another platform for unconditional propaganda. In Azerbaijan, both domestic and foreign critical internet media face blockades, rendering them inaccessible without the use of a VPN. Simultaneously, the government has established numerous internet media outlets that lack readership and primarily focus on promoting praise, flattery, and falsehoods. Consequently, the internet media landscape in the country serves as a form of propaganda to a larger extent.”

According to Goyushov, social networks represent the only platform in Azerbaijan where independent and critical opinions can be expressed. However, even in this domain, the government has taken measures to stifle dissent. Individuals who dare to voice independent and critical views on social media face constant punishment and imprisonment. “The government resorts to using dishonest foreign partners, funded by oil money, to employ various blocking methods and prevent the spread of critical opinions. In addition to these tactics, discriminatory algorithms are implemented to suppress free speech, and agreements are made with social network management to curtail the reach of critics’ content. The government maintains an army of thousands of trolls whose purpose is to file complaints against critical content, initiate smear campaigns, and organize attacks on the writers themselves. On the other hand, an alarming number of propaganda accounts are created to disseminate fake news and inundate the internet with flattery and praise. While social network administrators in other regions often take strict actions against such malicious practices, the trolls supported by the Azerbaijani government operate with an unparalleled level of tolerance.”

2/2/2023,Azerbaijan claims that there have been 39 more arrests for espionage against Iran.," 

The foreign ministry of Azerbaijan has confirmed that 39 detainees have been detained in relation to an Iranian “espionage network,” contradicting earlier claims that just seven suspects had been taken into custody.

39 persons have been detained as part of a special operation to uncover subversive actions in the nation “under the pretext of religion,” according to the ministry, as quoted by the Azerbaijani news agency APA on Wednesday.

The inmates, “acting as believers, made propaganda for Iran on social networks and violated the country’s freedom of religion, carrying out the assignments of the Iranian special services,” the ministry said.

A separate statement from the ministry on Wednesday stated that “it will use all available international channels to widely denounce the terror act on its embassy and punish the offenders.”

Following an armed attack on Azerbaijan’s embassy in Tehran last week that killed one security employee and injured two more, tensions between the nations have risen.

The ministry added that the Islamic Republic had made an effort to stop the terror attack from receiving widespread world attention.

Azerbaijan claims that the armed assault on its embassy was a “terrorist” act, but the Islamic Republic claims that the shooter’s motives looked to be personal rather than political.

The Republic of Azerbaijan urged its nationals not to visit Iran on Tuesday."
7/9/2021,Hello Azerbaijan from Poland!,"Hello Azerbaijan from Poland, I know it might be bizzare but I really got interested in your country! 

I don't want to get political or offend anybody but last year when the conflict started my mate's girlfriend who is Armenian (there is small diaspora in Poland) started to talk about it over and over again on every occasion. I never really knew much about the region (well maybe a thing or two about Georgia because our nations are really close) but I know straight up nationalist propaganda when I see/hear one. And I really don't like when someone takes me for a fool and try to tell me what to think. She really brainwashed my friend's head with this to the point that everytime I tried to counter some of her/their arguments (in casual conversation, you know like the friends have about what's going on in the world, nothing serious since it doesn't even affect me or him lol) they started to be super agressive and long story short cutted ties with me eventually lol 

So yeah, I just wanted to say hi Azerbaijan, I lost a friend because of you but I gained a new holiday destination"

**(Lack of ) Human Rights and Freedoms**

The National Council of Democratic Forces (NCDF) has released a statement regarding the escalating occurrences of torture in prison facilities. Instances of administrative violence and the mistreatment of inmates have once again surged in Azerbaijan. As per the most recent information made public, a few religious prisoners faced threats of sexual violence while incarcerated. The statement of NCDF reads: Administrative violence and torture have been weaponized throughout Aliyev’s rule. Ilham Aliyev did not hesitate to torture even the leaders of the political opposition and civil society. Ali Karimli, chairman of PFPA, the National Council Coordination Center and Musavat party member Tofig Yagublu, the late member of the National Council Ibrahim Ibrahimli, PFPA functionaries Fuad Gahramanli, Agil Maharramli, Babek Hasanov, Niyamaddin Ahmadov, Alizamin Salayev, social activists Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, Mehman Huseynov and many others, (hundreds in total) were subjected to severe torture on various occasions and under different circumstances. The terrible tortures inflicted on those arrested during Nardaran and Ganja incidents, the massive torture of soldiers in Tartar, as well as the extreme police violence against residents who protested due to environmental issues in Soyudlu village of Gadabay deserve a separate mention. The above facts are a testament to the fact that administrative violence and torture have become entrenched in Azerbaijani state policy. The recent re-intensification of torture at the level of state bodies indicates that Ilham Aliyev‘s government is not going to stop using this anti-human, illegal act as a coercion tool.”

The National Council is first and foremost calling on the international community and the democratic community of the world to adopt a firm position against the transformation of torture into a state policy in Azerbaijan. The people of Azerbaijan reject the mechanism of torture in the country, its orderers and executors, and want the authorities to put an end to this anti-human treatment. However, the repressive environment established in the country does not allow this public position to be expressed massively and openly.

The National Council declares that it will continue its struggle against the anti-democratic and anti-human activities of Ilham Aliyev‘s government despite all of the difficulties, persecution and pressures that come with this. The National Council calls on the people of Azerbaijan to support it more massively and more courageously in this struggle. “Our people should not come to terms with the current situation, and should not allow Ilham Aliyev‘s rule drag the country towards disaster for any longer”, concluded the statement.

Jafar Mirzayev, who was arrested on false charges after being deported from Germany, started a hunger strike. He demands compliance with the Readmission Agreement signed between the EU and the Republic of Azerbaijan, social support for his family living in deplorable conditions, and a meeting with representatives of Deutsche Botschaft Baku / German Embassy Baku. Exiled journalist Afgan Mukhtarov said that he “[hopes that the German embassy will comply with](https://www.facebook.com/afqan.muxtarli.9/posts/pfbid0ewh9b1Fp7Enq45TN9s1sxsueTTkn6MP12gry3VEDwm7EKUxVwamJ4CmkKuwiK3gdl) Jafar Mirzayev’s request. According to Mukhtarov, Germany, the European Union, and the UN are morally responsible for the arrest of Jafar Mirzayev, Samir Ashurov, Mutallim Orujov, Malik Rzayev, Punhan Karimli and Emin Malikov who were arrested upon their deportation from Germany. To date, the European Union and the UN have not issued any statement condemning the regime for not complying with the readmission agreement. The Baku office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees have not responded to the inquiries.

**Governance and Corruption**

The son of the regional chairman of the ruling YAP Party faces allegations of committing a significant fraud. Shamil Jafarzade, son of Elchin Ismayilov, the chairman of the Goranboy district branch of the New Azerbaijan Party (YAP), has been taken into custody. Jafarzadeh’s arrest is related to charges of engaging in a substantial fraud scheme.

Lieutenant Colonel Javid Talibov, a member of the Sabail District Police Department in Baku, is facing accusations of making death threats against his wife and committing fraud against his father-in-law. Information obtained by Meydan TV reveals an ongoing investigation within the internal affairs authorities, initiated in response to a complaint filed by Major General Ramiz Nagiyev, his father-in-law. Ramiz Nagiyev has previously held various high-ranking positions within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, including the Head of the 7th Department, the Internal Investigations Department, the Chief Anti-Narcotics Department, and the Police Department. He is currently retired.

According to reports, the police lieutenant colonel stands accused of misappropriating a portion of the proceeds from the sale of his father-in-law’s property. As per his father-in-law’s account, the individual who purchased the property was supposed to pay initial instalment. However, Javid Talibov proceeded to receive 200,000 manat worth of quinces without his knowledge. Prior to this, Javid Talibov had sold the family’s residence on the former Inqilab Street for 400,000 manats. Subsequently, he left his family, and his father-in-law was left with a 200,000 manat debt. The person who bought the property had connections to Javid Talibov through his nephew, Murad Tagiyev, who works in the department responsible for liaising with law enforcement agencies at the Presidential Administration, a source disclosed.

Member of the APFP Fuad Gahramanli said the current anti-democratic environment and state-sponsored corruption is a threat to national security. Gahramanli’s Facebook post: [The abolition of the electoral institution](https://www.facebook.com/fuad.gahramanli.54/posts/pfbid02162B6CrNSotNa9bskaVaHu6HJwcxH3H41CfGS8KPDBzxRKK4vZ9RFZasFbztAo7Nl), the formal character of laws, and the suppression of political freedoms slow down the country’s development, increase poverty, and create a deep gap between the state and the public. This shows that the state of anti-democracy in the country is also our national security issue today. The authoritarian regime, which sacrifices the highest interests of the state to its interests in power and corruption, poses a great threat to the national security of the Azerbaijani state. For such a regime, nationalist slogans are only needed to instill in the society the policy pursued in the interests of the political regime in the name of national interests. That’s why today’s patriotic speeches in the power circles are not accepted sincerely by the public, everyone sees that such statements are aimed at instilling support and loyalty to the current regime, not the state.”

Musavat, ReAl and Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (APFP) are among the latest parties that have been officially registered with the state agency. Before that, the ruling New Azerbaijan Party, AĞ Party, Civic Solidarity Party, and Azerbaijan National Independence Party were also registered in the state register. Nevertheless, the official registration of significant opposition parties has elicited a range of responses, with numerous independent journalists contending that, given the prevailing political climate, it seems improbable for any independent political party to achieve official registration without clandestine arrangements with the government behind closed doors.

Azerbaijan has concentrated its troops on the border with Armenia and on the contact line with Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said that the situation is very tense at the moment. “During the last week, the military and political situation in our region has deteriorated significantly. The reason is that Azerbaijan has been gathering troops along the contact line of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenian-Azerbaijani border for several days. “The anti-Armenian hate speeches in the Azerbaijani press and propaganda platforms have become more intense,” Pashinyan said.

Commenting on the recent tensions on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, director of the Baku Research Institute Altay Goyushov said that neither Aliyev nor Putin want peace in the Caucasus. “[The lack of peace in the Caucasus benefits both Aliyev](https://www.facebook.com/altaygoyushov/posts/pfbid0sTwQw3KnFEutL4Yj9Vr9YVydqNGa53g2nwAWK49bbXH5LE3LX7Zu4x5o3rvjoYjcl) and Putin. Aliyev definitely does not want peace. He had a great opportunity to achieve peace, but he didn’t take advantage of it, he chose a different tactic, and that tactic created the current situation. Why did he choose? Because Aliyev‘s priority is staying in power, and the constant emotional nationalist tension in this matter works to his full advantage. Saddam also used this tactic. But the point is that not even the Azerbaijani opposition wants peace. They entered the competition of nationalism with Aliyev. One day, they accuse Aliyev of preparing to sell Karabakh to Armenians, and the next day, they accuse Aliyev of not wanting peace, which is a primitive opportunism. In general, the Azerbaijani public does not know what it is doing, and it is just fooled by patriotism and anti-Armenian propaganda (like that new upside-down letter A). They don’t realize the prospect of tragic consequences if peace is not achieved. If peace fails it will be a devastation for the country. It is the ordinary people who will suffer most, not the people in power, or the opportunists in the opposition.”

Member of Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (APFP) Salyan branch Zaur Ahmadov was detained by two civilian police officers. Azadliq newspaper reports that Ahmadov was taken to an unknown destination, and only hours later, his family was informed that he was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment. According to Ahmadov’s family, Salyan Police Department rejected their request for a meeting. Ahmadov is one of the many members of the Party who were arrested on trumped-up charges, according to human rights lawyers. One of the members of the Party, Alizamin Salayev, who has been on hunger strike for more than 110 days, was sentenced to four imprisonments despite the calls from human rights organizations for his immediate release. 

**Governance and Corruption**

Sunday marked the 105th anniversary of the first democratic Republic in Azerbaijan. Despite its historical importance as the first democratic government in the Muslim world, the Azerbaijani authorities demonstrate considerably less interest in commemorating the ideals and founding fathers of the first Republic that lasted for two years between 1918-1920. While the government changed the name of the public holiday from “Republic Day” to “Independence Day” a few years ago, the state-controlled media every year devotes airtime to the glorification of the former president, Heydar Aliyev who ruled the counter from 1993 till 2003, when his son came to power after his death. Chairperson of the APFP Ali Karimli said that despite the government’s attempts to eradicate the memories of the Republic, it would not be possible to remove it from public memory. “[Neither the 70-year propaganda of the Bolsheviks nor the jealousy and slander of the family rule could remove](https://www.facebook.com/karimliali/posts/pfbid02R7GPB6QUFDQTpw5c4qgjwdngkgtdFLWmD7tj8athFSc6i6mBpXA1v7XwL8g2wg5al) the founder of Azerbaijan’s independence from the memories of our people. We commemorate our national leader Muhammad Amin Rasulzade and our founding fathers with respect and gratitude, who did the greatest service in declaring the independence of Azerbaijan, establishing the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan, keeping the national government standing for almost two years, and keeping the ideology of national independence alive even after the occupation of Azerbaijan. Long live Republican ideas, freedom, and justice! Happy Republic Day!”

Chairperson of the National Council of Democratic Forces historian Jamil Hasanli said that it is “a historical irony” that after a hundred years of the establishment of the Democratic Republic in Azerbaijan, family rule prevailed. “[Today is their day, not only the Republic’s birthday but also](https://www.facebook.com/cemil.hasanli/posts/pfbid0QrrJgL3HHunJcbFShtAbUrrs9RMkR4V9ZFy1AiATzC1maxZipgY9DpVS6v4n3ZuJl) the day of the founding fathers. What an honorable people they were. Today is not only Independence Day but also Republic Day. Not every independence means Republic. Our founding fathers built the building of independence on the foundations of the Republic. It is such a great irony of history that the monarchy “celebrates” the Republic: on Independence Day and Republic Day, not the fathers of the nation who sacrificed their lives and property for the Republic, but a KGB general, communist first secretary, and Politburo member, Heydar Aliyev who fought mercilessly against that Republic, its founders, and values for nearly half a century, is on the corner of the nation’s TV channels. Such a “symbiosis” of history could hardly be found anywhere.”

Member of the NCDF Tofig Yagublu said that the police intervened in the gathering of the opposition leaders in front of the Resulzade’s monument to commemorate the anniversary of the Republic. Yagublu: “[Alizamin Salayev, who fights against the](https://www.facebook.com/tofiq.yaqublu/posts/pfbid0dW64GGyECu8LYqAv67tiNNNw49MtchaZuLtRmVkw96FszfRDtWhvZGa9MXoSwtVzl) regime that turned the Republic into a monarchy, is spending the 111th day of his hunger strike in prison. Freedom to Alizamin Salayev. The authorities do not allow flying the flag of the European Union in Azerbaijan, which is a member of the Council of Europe. There was police intervention at Rasulzade‘s commemoration event. Today, as the National Council, we held a holiday event dedicated to the 105th anniversary of the Republic in front of the monument of Muhammad Amin Rasulzade in Novkhani. Ilham Aliyev, who once sent the ISIS flags to our rally at the Mehsul stadium, this time ordered his police to take down the flag of the European Union, which we raised at the rally. With this act, he showed that he shares the same mindset as ISIS. What else could explain the hate for the EU flag?”

On Sunday, Turkey held the runoff elections, which were widely discussed by the Azerbaijani public. Meydan Tv reports that the mayor of Bolu, Turkey, Tanju Özcan appealed to Ilham Aliyev, asking him not to interfere in the elections in Turkey. According to Özcan, many Azerbaijani pro-governmental politicians are involved in the propaganda in favor of Erdogan and his Party AKP.  

Chairperson of the Azerbaijan Democracy and Welfare Party (ADWP) Gubad Ibadoghlu said that the elections in Turkey should inspire the Azerbaijani voters to be more active in the upcoming elections. “[As for the people of Azerbaijan, who have become](https://www.facebook.com/gubad.ibadoglu/posts/pfbid02ZXDXYcZWCeYtpGRNadE7aRUaNQ9v1wAgXZDVbnzaCnMMhUpFZmtvmmGwVt8xCZMhl) fans of the elections in Turkey, we must force the authorities to hold free elections in Azerbaijan, at least at the level of Turkey. This should be an important problem to be solved by everyone who wants to see the future of the country bright. In this regard, the greatest responsibility falls on the political opposition and civil society. We should turn the citizens of Azerbaijan not into a group that watches the elections in other countries, but into a nation that demands the elections in its own country.”

Member of the APFP Fuad Gahramanli argued that the future of democracy in Azerbaijan is much more dependent on Russia’s defeat than a governmental change in Turkey. “[The main geopolitical factor affecting democratic](https://www.facebook.com/fuad.gahramanli.54/posts/pfbid0at4tqQ23kevqwRCNnuowZvpEGXsXZLLmsFW5ayH176CMhfGBa4kr9yaCmgDjamNJl) changes in Azerbaijan is connected to Putin‘s Russia, not to Turkey. Therefore, Russia’s defeat in Ukraine will open new opportunities for us. However, in all cases, as a nation, we should bear the responsibility of fighting for our rights because in no case an external factor leads to changes in exchange for the silence of the people.”

During his speech at the meeting of the Supreme Economic Council of the Eurasian Economic Union, which was held in Moscow, President Ilham Aliyev stated that Azerbaijan never had a territorial claim against any country and it desires only to achieve the opening of transport communication with the neighboring country. President’s statement was considered as the denial of his government’s previous claims about the Zangazur corridor and Armenian territorial integrity. In Azerbaijan, the opposition believes that the Eurasian Economic Union is Putin‘s project for restoring the USSR.

Journalist Seymur Hezi said that Aliyev‘ ’s attendance at the meeting puts the national interests in danger. “[We cannot have any future with Putin, with Putin’s Russia,](https://www.facebook.com/seymur.hezi/posts/pfbid0Y7JrAtrHzqyy9RC2pofEoYGrGi1CpEQsV5UxHPpFjRifem2x8gokqJD5tZdj6f2Rl) or with imperialist Moscow. All these initiatives are harmful as well as inappropriate.”

Chairperson of the APFP Ali Karimli also said that Aliyev‘s participation in the summit of the Eurasian Economic Union together with the leaders of Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan is “an act against the national interests”. Karimli: “I remind you that [the Eurasian Union was created on the initiative of Russia as](https://www.facebook.com/karimliali/posts/pfbid02ZuGw8cTaNV4CQyVSEpxXB8bibCYvYKxWz7MGihLJ38THnSJVYzxC6WEspJgTVMBal) an alternative to the European Union. The presidents of Cuba and Tajikistan also participated in today’s summit of the Union in an online format. Look at the countries that Ilham Aliyev wants our country to integrate with. Russia’s participation in this imperial institution excludes integration with the European Union. The Eurasian Union, together with the CSTO, was conceived as the foundation of Putin‘s new imperial project, “USSR-2”. Ilham Aliyev‘s support for Russia’s imperial policy at a time when even Russia’s closest allies are beginning to distance themselves from it is illogical and can only be explained by a desire to strengthen solidarity among authoritarian regimes and slow down the global democratic changes that await the region. Even at a time when Russia is weakened and isolated, if Ilham Aliyev does not say no to this country’s imperial projects, imagine what would await us if Russia wins in Ukraine. The one-man rule in Azerbaijan not only takes away our rights and freedoms, not only robs our national wealth but also creates a grave threat to our state independence.”

6/3/2021,People need to realize Turkic Iranians are here to stay and no amount of whining will change that. So can the mode please ban the racist and inflammatory accounts baiting Iranian Turks?,"Turks have been some of Iran’s most ardent defenders, mobilizing Sunnis, Christians, Persians, Arabs and Kurds to defend Iran’s borders more times than anybody can count. Iran has a long and proud Turkic history too. And if it weren’t for Russian land theft Iran would be the world’s second largest Turkic country and power (right now it’s the 3rd biggest) . So everybody bitching about this or that “insert famous person here” not being “le rEaL tUrK” and is somehow always a secret Persian or ethnically Iranic needs to seriously shut the fuck up, it couldn’t be more irrelevant. 

This hyperfixation on race, ethnicity, and language is such a modernist farce. Either way, no country in the world is closer to Iran culturally than Azerbaijan and likewise no country aside from Iran is most similar to Azerbaijan. To add, even the Turkic nomads of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are closer to Iranians than they are to Turkey. The only reason any tensions exist between The Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran is because their secular dictator (Elchibey) correctly realized that a friendly Iran would be a threat to his power, and despite the fact that Iran was the first country to recognize Azerbaijan, Elchibey responded to friendly overtures by making claims on Iran’s land and threatening to “free” Azeri lands in the south. This is the only reason Iran and Azerbaijan are geopolitically hostile today as Azerbaijan’s whole reason for existing is it is a creation of Russian land theft, and this reality is simply too bitter a pill for some to swallow, and as a result an elaborate propaganda campaign has been constructed to assign a false identity to the RoA that some racist Persians seem to be happy to feed into. As if the RoA is where the Turks are and Iran is where the Persians are. 

For some reason a select few racist Iranians seem content to give up Central Asia and Azerbaijan to Turkey just because they are Turkic. Some people’s minds have been colonized by European notions of ethnonationalism. It’s sad to see Azerbaijan fall victim to this but now some Iranians seem to be falling victim to it too. Iran is a partly Turkic nation and should be proud to be so. Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are far closer to Iran culturally and historically than they are to Turkey. why some Persians don’t see any commonality between themselves and Caucasian and Central Asian Turks is  a sad testimony to the efficacy of Shahi and Communist (USSR) propaganda to drive a divide between the two. Iran’s commonalities with the rest of the Turkic run extremely deep. 

In lieu of all this can the mods please ban the Azeri trolls masquerading as racist Persians that are constantly promoting Turkic erasure. It’s downright offensive, all of these talking points have their origins in racist, ethnocentric, and modernist ideologies supported by Monarchists and Soviets who sought to collectively rape the Iranian nation and it’s history in an effort to erase what makes us unique."

10/8/2023,Confused as to why people support Ukraine but are against Palestine?!,
7/26/2020,Azerbaijan is a tragicomedy.,"Take it from the governmental power to the people itself. Everything is tragically a big joke. 

I was born in here and i still live here. It both makes me laugh and also make me sad when i see in which conditions people live here. Everybody - including myself have to work our asses off for absolutely nothing. Unless you have a lot of money, you will probably not be successful. Because bribery is very common in Azerbaijan among pretty much every rank and role. No, i'm not saying everybody does it. That would be stupid. There are good people, who are in good ranks who still have humane feelings. But unfortunately, most are not. So you better save a lot of money for your dreams. 

Let's move to the government, media & television. Both media & television are controlled by the government and is full of state propaganda. Say one wrong thing out of the script on the television about the current regime in Azerbaijan and you will disappear, you may not want it, they will make you disappear & perish eternally! This is comedic & tragic for a country that wants to be a part of European Union & NATO and constantly brings up human rights while desperately silencing any signs of freedom of speech in the country. 

The books are full of propaganda, inserting constant hatred into the youngsters' brains about the Armenians. They are told that the Armenians will cut their head, rape their children and no single Armenian should ever be trusted. Ironic of a country to say this when there are high ranks related with the Armenians and Russians that the regime blames too. Take it from the recent event - Necmeddin Sadigov  who is currently accused of selling the coordinates of Azerbaijani posts to the Armenian side. 

When you talk about politics in Azerbaijan, be aware! The spies are definitely out there listening to you somewhere and they'll somehow still find out. Reminds me of the KGB the KGB of the Soviet Union, the same Soviet Union our history books criticize.  People are literally scared of talking about the government in their houses and i have seen this pretty much everywhere. 

When it comes to the Karabakh situation things are really complicated. It's very likely that peace won't ever happen. Humans from both sides will perish, mothers will weep and children will be left fatherless. All because of a claim on a portion of a planet that we didn't create. 

The diaspora aren't doing a much better job either. Constantly ganging up on each other, beating up innocent people in the process who probably don't even want any of this. I'm pretty sure there will be deleted comments down below here too of people arguing and mods removing their comments & possibly banning them. But before you post anything please stop and think, is it really worth it at all? No one gains anything from meaningless arguments on the internet, you only waste hours of your life that you will never regain. 

I've never seen a tragicomedy that is played by 10+ million people. I would never think i would be a part of it, but here i am and so are you. We aren't aware of the future, maybe one day one of those bombs will land on my house, kill my family and me too. But who knows? I guess we are destined to do this forever then. 

See you in wherever we ever meet after it's all over!"
10/28/2020,"Oops! Another staged and failed performance by #Azerbaijan - #Turkey propaganda. Turkish journalist pretends to report from alleged attack site in Barda, while the footage in background is from the shelling of #Stepanakert. https://t.co/9QALWRvKu1",
10/5/2020,The USA will never be a friend to Armenia as long as conservative think-tanks like the Heritage Foundation influence foreign policy.,">""Armenia is largely a lost cause; Azerbaijan, even with all its flaws, is a better bet.""

This is a quote from the article [Why The West Needs Azerbaijan](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/28/why-the-west-needs-azerbaijan/) by [The Heritage Foundation's Director of Foreign Policy, Luke Coffey](https://www.heritage.org/staff/luke-coffey).  [Luke Coffey's Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/LukeDCoffey) is full of pro-Azerbaijani and anti-Armenian propaganda which is constantly linked to from their sides to add legitimacy to their false reporting during the recent conflict.

In that article, Coffey argues for his and his foundations conclusions that the USA must become a strong ally to Azerbaijan in order to secure the oil pipelines, trade routes, and fiber-optic cables passing through the ""Ganja Gap"" which connect Asia to Europe.  He explains that the only other routes connecting the two continents go through Iran, Russia, and Pakistan, direct opponents to the USA.  This is an absolutely crucial strategic choke point that would, if it were to be controlled by Russia and its allies, seriously weaken the USA's influence not only in the region but across the two continents, and, subsequently, the world.  He goes on to dismiss any potential for the West to ""leverage"" Armenia because Armenia historically has, and under Pashinyan continues to seek strong ties with Russia.

These people and institutions do not care about anything except increasing America's power in the world, as well as their own power in the American government.  In that article Coffey, without any sense of irony, even admits that cozying up to Azerbaijan has been and may continue to be tough due to their human rights violations and actions against journalists and other perceived enemies of their regime.  These people do not want to ""spread freedom and democracy"" throughout the world, or even support ""conservative Christian values"" as they claim.  They're just playing everyone as pawns in their game of world domination.

With the recent successful bombings of Ganja, I expect these policy wonks and shills to become much more vocal and start applying much more pressure towards this issue.  So far during this war,  American news outlets have been eerily absent with coverage of it, and if I put on my conspiracy tin-foil hat on for a moment, I suspect, though I hope I'm wrong, that it's because behind the scenes the government is trying to figure out the proper pro-Azerbaijan (or at least neutral) narrative for them to use.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I was afraid some people were going to get hung-up on the word ""conservative"" in the title.  I just used the Heritage Foundation's own self-identification as a conservative institution, I was not suggesting that this was a liberal vs. conservative issue.  In fact, I tend to follow the [horseshoe theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory) and consider both the neocons and the neolibs much closer together than they are apart with their agendas.  I fear that both the democratic and republican parties have been compromised by similar think-tanks with the same global outlook."

**KOMMERSANT:** Russian government assesses the overall situation as very difficult. Azerbaijan isn't ready for concessions. All the efforts by the West and Russia have not given any results. The government of Nagorno-Karabakh is also persistent.

Russia offered a solution: launch the traffic via Aghdam with the help of the Red Cross, then reopen the Lachin Corridor 24 hours later. Initially, both sides expressed interest at a high level but Nagorno-Karabakh later demanded for the Lachin traffic to resume the same day, not later.

Nagorno-Karabakh later stated that the goods entering through the Aghdam road should not have Azerbaijani origin. Later [Azerbaijan kidnapped an ethnic Armenian hospital patient named Vagif Khachatryan who was traveling through the Lachin Corridor to Armenia]. No deal was reached. Russia believes the Aghdam road will eventually open. // end

Azerbaijan has confirmed that such offer existed but no deal was reached.

Nagorno-Karabakh demands the complete removal of the illegal Azerbaijani checkpoint on the Lachin Corridor, installed in violation of the Nov. 9 agreement. 

Kommersant's source did not clarify what ""reopening"" the Lachin Corridor would entail. Would Azerbaijan continue to illegally stop to search the passengers and traffic while claiming the corridor is technically ""open""? Would Azerbaijan illegally demand the transferred goods to be taxed while claiming the corridor is technically ""open""?

##Nagorno-Karabakh opposition leader Samvel Babayan responds to Kommersant story: it was a faux deal by Russia trying to stay relevant in the region

**REPORTER:** Why did the deal fail?

**BABAYAN:** I was present during a meeting organized by the government to discuss that offer and I expressed my disapproval because the offer was superficial in nature. Russia is trying to show that it's still a regional player in response to the U.S.'s recent attempt to organize a meeting between the parties. We are a toy for superpowers, they are trying to promote their interests by using us.

From now on, I advise the superpowers to keep their little games to themselves. Both Armenians and Azeris have a tongue and know how to speak. We will meet face-to-face and discuss our issues. Thank you very much.

**REPORTER:** Kommersant writes that the parties had almost agreed but Nagorno-Karabakh was the one that rejected it at the last moment. 

**BABAYAN:** I don't know what the government told Russia behind closed doors but a meeting was organized between all political forces and the government to discuss the offer. Everyone was against it. 

These types of ""negotiations"" must stop now. We must have a clearly formulated document of topics that we want to discuss with Azerbaijan face-to-face before we send anyone.

Russia is done. They lost relevance the moment they surrendered the Lachin Corridor to Azerbaijan. They shouldn't make any noises now and try to exert their dominance anymore.

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh president Arayik believes that Azerbaijan blocked the Lachin Corridor because Armenia is resisting and refusing to grant a ""corridor"" to Azerbaijan via Syunik. Do you agree?

**BABAYAN:** No. Absolutely no. Azerbaijan has blocked Lachin to subjugate the population of Nagorno-Karabakh so they'll have no choice but to ""integrate"". It's our fault that we didn't demand sufficient guarantees for the Lachin Corridor from the beginning, that we voluntarily surrendered territories [located between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh] without receiving sufficient guarantees. 

What we need today is a document that'll be the basis for NK-AZ negotiations so we'll understand what each side really wants and what steps they are willing to take.

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh government helped elect an ARF MP as the president of parliament. Does this signal a shift in Nagorno-Karabakh's foreign policy?

**BABAYAN:** They think it'll help activate the diaspora but I disagree. If anything, it could strain the relations with Armenia, which we can't afford right now.

**REPORTER:** You wrote letters to Serj in 2013 and Pashinyan in 2018 describing the types and quantities of weapons we needed to purchase, and in the event they couldn't be purchased, you explained that serious diplomatic concessions needed to be made. 

Had they followed your advice then, do you believe we would have a different outcome in 2020, or do you believe Turkey-Azerbaijan-Russia were already determined to force Armenia to make painful concessions?

**BABAYAN:** We would have a different outcome. Azerbaijan wouldn't be able to launch a 2020-style war.

**REPORTER:** I've read your letters since 2013 and they predict the future correctly. Did Serj and Pashinyan ignore them because they *wanted* this outcome, or because they were shortsighted?

**BABAYAN:** When the War Commission was launched, I wanted them to investigate all the events dating back to 15 years. But they refused, so I refused to take part in the Commission. Going back 15 years would tell us if things were brought to this state knowingly and intentionally. We need to understand what the problem was with the acquisition of those weapons. If we had a personnel shortage, why didn't we take steps to ensure that, for example, 3 people are assigned to an artillery battery as opposed to 7? 

**REPORTER:** You believe we need to be pragmatic and agree to concessions now to avoid bloodshed and to keep Nagorno-Karabakh Armenian. Your critics consider this a defeatist stance. Why is there a propaganda machine working against you?

**BABAYAN:** Because I'm the only public figure in Nagorno-Karabakh who isn't working as a spy for another state. My proposal is actually a standard practice: Before you send someone for negotiations you need to have a comprehensive document that describes the topics you want to negotiate, and your goals. I've never proposed turning us into an ethnic minority within Azerbaijan. If you aren't going to help me with this process, at least don't get in my way. We have too many hobo analysts, who understand nothing about Nagorno-Karabakh, opposing these efforts. They will smarten up gradually. Let's give them another 15-25 days.

**REPORTER:** Are there any circles in Russia, or perhaps Russia itself, who are opposed to your activities in Nagorno-Karabakh? Is Russia afraid of being pushed out of the region if Nagorno-Karabakh chooses your route and starts resolving its problems with Azerbaijan without Russia's ""help""? 

**BABAYAN:** Let's not single out Russia here. If Nagorno-Karabakh exercises true independence and takes steps to resolve its own issues, no foreign state will like that because they prefer to have a puppet.

Kommersant wrote that Nagorno-Karabakh had initially agreed to the Aghdam deal but turned it down at the last moment. When Russia figures out how and why it was turned down, when they finally realize that we refuse to be puppets anymore, they will understand what's going on. 

**REPORTER:** What is Russia's solution to this conflict?

**BABAYAN:** Yesterday Russia copy-pasted a text from international laws regarding ethnic minorities, and presented it as a solution. Russia says the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, within Azerbaijan, will have their separate sports tournaments, preserve their language and schools, and all that stuff, lol. Even Azerbaijan hasn't dared to present anything like that.

Knowing that Nagorno-Karabakh will be against this idea, Russia will propose it anyway, expecting it to be rejected and the conflict to continue. This is how they control the region and promote their interests. The only losers are Armenians and Azeris.

**REPORTER:** The conflict was frozen after the 90's war. After the 2020 war, Vladimir Putin said the conflict should be frozen again and left for future generations. Is Russia trying to freeze the conflict so it can later unfreeze it at any time to resolve geopolitical issues? Also, what's your stance on the West's strategy?

**BABAYAN:** Any country has its interests and solutions. We have ours. We must sit down and discuss our issues directly with Azeris. Azerbaijan must realize that if the conflict is frozen again, two decades later we're going to have another bloody war and there is no guarantee they will win. 

**REPORTER:** What can/should the Republic of Armenia do?

**BABAYAN:** 1) To do what they are currently doing: work with international institutions, but with more vigor. 2) Send more economic aid.

##ex-PM Aram Sargsyan about the Nagorno-Karabakh war

...

**SARGSYAN:** Armenia's #1 issue today is the outdated army management and insufficient armament. Russia was supposed to arm us but didn't. At least the West has functional weapons. Russian weapons have been proven to be inferior while their military education is worthless. Armenian generals received their education in Russian academies with a bottle of cognac. Azeri generals were in the same spot.

On the 14th day of the war, Ilham Aliyev complained about the difficulties on the battlefield, suggesting that Armenians were too entrenched. That was the best moment to reach a peace agreement but Russia proposed an unfavorable plan and no agreement was reached. Turkey's CoGS sent its experts to Azerbaijan, sidelined Azeri CoGS, and took full control over the management and strategy with NATO standards. 

Armenia needs weapons from France, U.S., and the civilized world. Russia doesn't have what we need. *""The West is not providing any tangible support,""* critics say. Who do you think prevented Azerbaijan from invading Syunik to force a corridor in 2021-2022? Western diplomats stood in Syunik and then dispatched their border observers there. 

Russia and Azerbaijan still want that corridor but are silent because of the opposition from the collective West. Aliyev had to back away and announce that by ""corridor"" he doesn't mean a sovereign corridor, and that he similarly refers to China's trade route as a ""corridor"". The West helped prevent the formation of a ""corridor"" through Syunik. 

The Armenian government is still too cautious and afraid of adopting a closer stance toward the West. Sometimes you have to *do* it. Make the step, sign an agreement of strategic cooperation with the U.S. if you want more support, and not just military support.

The former U.S. ambassador revealed in 2021 that the U.S. is ready to invest $8 billion in the renewable energy sector with an emphasis on solar, primarily in the Syunik province of Armenia, on the hills near village Lichk [between Kajaran and Meghri]. 

At first, I thought it was purely a political program to ""save"" Syunik but the calculations of the sunny days in Armenia made it obvious there is a strong economic incentive as well. That area has many sunny days in a year. 

That statement by the ex-ambassador was made publicly. Has anyone ever reached out to him? I have, but I'm not the government. 

Have you ever heard of any Western leader stating that Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan? Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov, on the other hand, have stated exactly that. Lavrov said that Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh must become ethnic minorities within Azerbaijan, without any status or a line of contact.

We must respect Russia, but we must understand that they've become our enemy. Their interests align with Azerbaijan's. Don't expect any empathy from the Russian peacekeepers in Lachin. They aren't going to drive those parked humanitarian trucks to Nagorno-Karabakh.

The issue with Russia goes deeper. Their agents are everywhere in Armenia. Some of them see Armenia as a Tatarstan within Russia, others took funds from Gasprom to run for upcoming municipal elections in Armenia while promising to make water, electricity, and transportation free.

Right now Armenia should focus on getting a UNSC resolution on the unblocking of the Lachin Corridor. I'm confident we'll succeed. And if there is a veto, the Armenian public will see the face of our foe. End the practice of timidity. You don't need approval from Moscow before your every step.

##sociologist Karen Sargsyan about the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict

**SARGSYAN:** Aliyev is in a situation where he can only increase the bet. Unlike his fellow dictator Putin, he doesn't have the flexibility to slip up. It's further complicated by the appearance of new cards in the hands of Pashinyan: the World Court ruling and the analysis made by the former prosecutor of the International Criminal Court about the impending genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh.

That analysis was picked up by the international media. They are comparing Nagorno-Karabakh to Srebrenica and Khartoum, with the main point being the need to act immediately to prevent the repetition of previous genocides, so billions of dollars won't need to be spent later to address the outcome. 

German outlets, big and small, are criticizing PM Scholz for remaining silent.

Foreign Minister Mirzoyan has made 12 phone calls over the past 3 days, all addressed to Western and non-CSTO countries. He is on the right track. He always mentions that Azerbaijan's goal is genocide.

As I've said earlier, Aliyev has chosen the path of Vladimir Putin: raise the bet higher and higher. But if Putin can use the factor of internal consolidation and concentration of power to frequently screw up by getting semi-couped by Prigozhin and acting like nothing has happened, by losing several occupied regions of Ukraine and ignoring it, by threatening strikes and never following through with the promise, Aliyev can't afford the same weakness.

Aliyev doesn't have that luxury. All it took is one small village in Azerbaijan to complain about environmental issues for the entire country to react. There are ropes wrapped around Aliyev that can tighten at any moment.
The only thing Aliyev is successfully selling today is the limited quantities of fossil energy.

Azerbaijan is not in a position to ignore the Western demands today. Pashinyan needs to send humanitarian aid to Ukraine and declare that Armenia recognizes Ukraine's borders under the 1991 CIS agreement, just as we want Azerbaijan to recognize our 1991 borders. 

It doesn't matter anymore if it'll piss Russia off. They have already sold you to Turkey and Azerbaijan in exchange for Turkish sea routes and Azeri trade routes. 

Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh are playing backgammon with Azeri soldiers while the Armenian population serves. It's business for them. As of December data, during the blockade, peacekeepers would import food and sell it to the Armenian population for ֏10,000 a box or $10,000 per lorry.

Ilham Aliyev is a war criminal. Under international law, the death of those two children and the frequent fainting of pregnant women in Nagorno-Karabakh, caused by the blockade, is considered a war crime. We must emphasize the similarities between the actions of Russia and Azerbaijan.

12/6/2020,Solidarity from Rojava,"Now more than ever is time to counter Turkish fascism, they are expanding and bringing out genocides. Down below is the part out of our new political and military analysis regarding Armenia, if you wish to read the full analysis you can click [here](https://riseup4rojava.org/es/evaluacion-de-la-situacion-actual-politica-militar-1o-de-diciembre-2020/)


After the Armenian President, Pashinyan, under pressure from the Russian regime and confronted with the devastating situation on the battlefield announced the de facto surrender of all Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh on 10th November, the armed clashes between the Turkish-Azerbaijani occupation forces and Artsakh’s defense army came to an abrupt end. After more than 40 days of fierce fighting, the Armenian defenders had to bow to the superiority of the Turkish-Azerbaijani occupation coalition. Even though the Turkish armed forces officially played no role on the battlefield and both states vehemently denied a Turkish intervention, there is no doubt that the main force and brain behind the Azerbaijani offensive was none other than the AKP-MHP regime itself. From day one, the representatives of the palace regime did not miss any opportunity to express their support for dictator Aliyev and his criminal regime, and the Turkish Ministry of Defence reported daily on the progress of the Azerbaijani troops. When talking about the Azerbaijani troops, one spoke openly of “our Turkish soldiers” and even went so far as to speak of “our citizens” in the reporting of civilian losses on the Azerbaijani side. The slogan “two states, one nation” filled the streets of Azerbaijan and Turkey, and the Azerbaijani troops openly marched into the field with the flag of the Turkish Republic. The television channels of the Turkish regime propaganda reported every other minute about the successes of the “Azerbaijani Turkish brothers” in the “defense of the fatherland”, and the pictures of soldiers who greeted the cameraman with the ‘wolf salute’, the distinctive sign of Turkish fascists, flickered across the screens.

For the AKP-MHP regime, which had previously relied increasingly on neo-Ottoman propaganda for its expansionist ambitions in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and other areas of the Middle East, the war against the Republic of Artsakh has become a literal test run for ‘Turanism’. Turanism is the name given to the Pan-Turkish superpower fantasy of establishing a mythological empire that unites all Turkic peoples from Central Asia to the Middle East under one state. This fascist ideology, which is based on the superiority of the Turkish race, was not only adhered to by the masterminds of the Turkish national state, the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress (Ittihad ve Terraki), but it is also the official ideology of the Turkish regime party MHP. Turanism is also widespread among the supporters of the Azerbaijani regime. If you look at the map, you will quickly see that the elimination of Armenian autonomy represents a decisive step towards the territorial unification of both Turkish states. The decisive factor that turned the war in favour of the Turanian coalition forces was also the Turkish air support in Nagorno-Karabakh. For the Armenian units, death came from the air. The Armenian troops suffered the greatest losses from the blows of the Turkish Bayraktar TB 2 drones. In addition, the Turkish-Azerbaijani troops were supported on the ground by numerous Islamist mercenaries that the Turkish regime transferred from the occupied territories in Syria and Libya, as cannon fodder, to the fronts of Nagorno-Karabakh.

After the withdrawal of the Armenian troops, the mass exodus of the Armenian population of Artsakh, and the transfer of the territories to the Azerbaijani occupation forces under Russian supervision, it is still unclear whether and in what form the Turkish army will have an official presence in the occupied territories, but the outcome of the war is a victory for Turkish fascism and a gift to the regime. With or without an official presence: Turkish army and secret service are active on the ground and actively coordinated the war events, thousands of Islamist murder gangs secure influence and control for the regime, and the plan of opening a corridor between Turkey, the Azerbaijani autonomous region of Nakhivan, and Azerbaijan under the agreement are big steps forward in the strategic expansion project of Turkish fascism. The regime, which poisons the heads and hearts of the people with its fascist propaganda, was able to stabilise its position at home with the mobilization of Turanism, and Erdogan had himself celebrated as the “Conqueror of Karabakh”. The war in Nagorno-Karabakh should have made it clear once and for all to everyone that the regime in Ankara is not interested in securing its own borders or fighting terrorism, but only in realising its own expansionist superpower project."

**MOD:** The Azerbaijani army violated the ceasefire by using mortars and drones against Armenian positions starting at 7:50 a.m. on Friday. //

MOD released footage showing an accumulation of Azerbaijani equipment near the border: [video](https://twitter.com/azatutyunradio/status/1697556581477404927).

3 KIA and 2 WIA on the Armenian side.

The Armenian army used drones against Azeri troops. They had 3 WIA as of Friday morning, with another report stating 5 KIA by afternoon.

A [video was published](https://youtu.be/86hyA-xsp8w?t=13) reportedly showing an Armenian drone dropping a munition at Azeri soldiers, wounding 2 of them.

The [second video](https://youtu.be/6072nnRecJg?t=10) was published later showing an Azeri soldier being struck by a munition dropped from a drone.

The aforementioned Azeri soldiers were located within the sovereign territory of Armenia. They invaded these territories in 2022.

**Government:** All units of the armed forces of Azerbaijan must be withdrawn from the sovereign territory of Armenia. Azerbaijan must end the illegal blockade of the Lachin corridor and Nagorno-Karabakh.

**Ambassador-at-large Marukyan:** Azerbaijan's attack is a direct damage to the mediation efforts of the USA, France, and EU. It is a direct damage to the ongoing peace negotiation process and a violation of all of Azerbaijan's commitments to date. This aggression must be stopped immediately and the aggressor must be held responsible.


##... how did it start?

**REPORTER:** What can you tell us about the attack?

**ANDRANIK KOCHARYAN (defense official):** Azeri soldiers opened fire while our troops were organizing a routine rotation in their positions. What I can tell you is that our army is in better shape now, and Azeri ceasefire violations are no longer going unanswered. Our soldiers fired back. 

Azeri soldiers must understand that these ceasefire violations won't solve anything. They must exercise discipline and not open fire during our troop rotation process or whenever we do engineering work with heavy equipment. They will receive an answer if they do.

**REPORTER:** Did Azerbaijan use a mortar against one of our vehicles?

**ANDRANIK:** Yes. Our losses were caused by the shrapnel. It didn't go unanswered. This isn't 2021 when they could brazenly open fire thinking there wouldn't be consequences.

##... military expert Artsrun Hovhannisyan about the border attack & army reforms 

**REPORTER:** Is there an accumulation of forces by Azerbaijan?

**ARTSRUN:** Azerbaijan has brought artillery units closer to the border, as you saw in the video, but it's not in large quantities. 

**REPORTER:** We saw videos of Armenian drones dropping munitions on Azeri soldiers. It looked like Ukrainians using their now-famous quadcopters. Does this show progress?

**ARTSRUN:** This isn't the first time our army has used them, but it's the first time it was revealed in HD. These drones are great but to win modern wars you need bigger weapons. 

**REPORTER:** How much time does Armenia need to restore its military after the 2020 losses?

**ARTSRUN:** If we maintain the intensity of ongoing reforms, which we've witnessed especially over the past year, within the next 1-2 years we will have an army that's better and more modern than our 2020 army.
I don't like openly discussing our accomplishments and purchases from other countries. Keep quiet and work, keep quiet and buy, keep quiet and manufacture.

##EU proposes step-by-step approach to end the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh

**Charles Michel's plan:** The step-by-step approach would reflect a sequencing in the full-fledged operation of the Lachin corridor and the opening of the Agdam route. 

Sequencing of these steps and the type of cargo that would be delivered by each of these roads, as well as attendant procedures, have been the core of the recent discussions.

The EU strongly believes the Lachin corridor must be unblocked, in line with past agreements and the World Court Order. The use of the Agdam road to provide supplies can also be part of a sustainable solution to the provision of urgent and daily basic needs.

Exchanges have also focused on restoring electricity and gas supplies to Karabakh Armenians as soon as possible.

Dialogue between Baku and representatives of Armenians living in the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast will be essential in this regard. The rights and security of Karabakh Armenians must be guaranteed and discussions on specific modalities should start as soon as possible. //

##Armenian Government asks Parliament to officially ratify the Rome Statute despite warnings from Russia 

Russia had earlier warned Armenia about ""extremely negative consequences"" for bilateral relations if it's ratified. The Armenian Government gave reassurances that it was not aimed against Russia, and subsequently postponed the decision to ratify it, until now.  

>Armenia's ratification of the statute would theoretically obligate the country to arrest those for whom the [International Criminal Court] has issued arrest orders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, if they visit the country

>Therefore, ratification would be a significant sign of Armenia's efforts to reduce alignment with Russia

Armenian Government says the ratification's goal is to bring war crimes cases against the Azerbaijani military.

##interview between military expert Artsrun Hovhannisyan and analyst Karen Sargsyan: Ukraine war

**KAREN:** What's happening in Ukraine?

**ARTSRUN:** Critics have pointed to a lack of ""breakthrough"" to suggest Ukraine's assault has failed. But this isn't a classical assault. Instead of starting from the frontline and reaching the depths, Ukraine is doing it reversed. They started by destroying Russia's logistics routes, storage facilities, command centers, and bridges located in the rear. It's meant to isolate and weaken the Russian troops on the frontline.

As we speak, Ukrainian forces have broken through the first defense line in Robotine. There are reports that this settlement has been captured.

Now Ukraine will insert several Brigades along its mobile reserves that are equipped with Western armored vehicles. There will be fierce battles. If Ukraine breaks through the 3rd defense line, they will reach the Sea of Azov.

Ukraine's job will be very difficult. The last time this type of [multi-layered defense line named after Surovikin] was successfully breached was by the U.S. army in southern Iraq in 1991. 

USSR grossly exaggerated the Finnish defense line (Mannerheim Line) claiming it was all covered in concrete, etc. It's all a myth. Only ~60 of the 214 firing positions were concrete. The rest was mud, wood, and simple machine guns. In their attempt to breach this line, the USSR had to fire 46,000 units of 203mm artillery shells, carry out 80,000 flights, and utilize 2.5 armies (each 100,000).

Soviet Gen. Zhukov was tasked with breaching the Berlin defense. He had 11 armies, 2 aviation armies, and 2 tank armies. I want you to understand the density. The narrowest frontline that the USSR could breach was 27 km. For each 1 km, they brought 360 artillery pieces and dropped tons and tons of bombs on German heads.

Now back to the U.S. assault on Iraq in 1991. It lasted 42 days. During the first 38 days, U.S. aviation conducted 110,000 combat flights. This was followed by 2.5 hours of heavy artillery prep work with 90,000 shells, and only then they proceeded to roll the tanks.

Do you see the density of preparatory work in these examples? Ukraine has launched its offensive with insufficient assault power. No air superiority, which is mandatory for the attacker; not enough artillery density; not enough armored vehicles, they don't have a 3x advantage. 

This is why it may appear that Ukraine's strategic goal is unachievable. In my opinion, this operation, as of right now, is generally slow but sufficiently fast considering the aforementioned ratio of forces.

We've seen Ukraine successfully use small drones to fly long distances or use long-range missiles to target bridges. Imagine what they could do if they had the numbers. 

**KAREN:** Why did Russia withdraw troops from elsewhere and deploy them in the Kupiansk [north] direction?

**ARTSRUN:** Germans had realized that since they could face a numerically superior force, they couldn't keep very large reserves, so they'd need to maneuver with whatever reserves they had by deploying them in the right location at the right time. 

Today both sides are attempting that approach. Russia attacked Kupiansk to prevent Ukrainian reserves located in this direction from being used elsewhere to achieve a breakthrough. 

Ukraine, with the help of NATO's intel, is maneuvering its reserves better. They are focused on Robotine right now, but at any time they could quickly deploy these reserves elsewhere if necessary. They have this ability. They still have the German-made Marders, Swedish CV90s, and a bunch of other reserves.

Russia, after the unsuccessful assault on Kupiansk, is moving its forces to close the hole in Robotine.

**KAREN:** But they have to travel a long distance from Kupiansk to Robotine. There is no ""straight line"".

**ARTSRUN:** That makes their job even more difficult. Russia is losing this battle of reserve maneuverability. They also haven't announced the second mobilization yet. Now would be the time to conclude it, but they haven't even launched it yet. Last time when they delayed the first mobilization it cost them the Kharkiv region.

This is why, *at a minimum*, I won't rule out that this particular Ukrainian assault could succeed by November.

Let's forget about the F-16 jets for a second. If Ukraine could receive 200 pieces of ATACMS, the American equivalent of Iskander, it could change everything.

**KAREN:** Let's not forget how a couple of HIMARs changed the weather. Let's talk about F-16. They are already training Ukrainian pilots. Germany plans to buy 100 Leopard-1 tanks from Greece for Ukraine.

**ARTSRUN:** Bradley, Marder, and CV90 armored vehicles will bring more benefits during this assault than the old Leopard-1 tanks. 

Even Russian analysts admit now that Ukraine's ordinary artillery units, thanks to Ukraine's Western-oriented strategy, are superior to Russian artillery. Ukraine's 155mm artillery is more precise, has a longer reach, work far apart from each other, receives info from satellites, etc. The German artillery doctrine utilized by Russia is dying. The U.S. doctrine is winning.

There is also a political component. The government must have a very clear understanding of what it wants and what the objectives are. Lack of clear objectives leads to defeat during a war of attrition.

Let's look at the U.S.'s defeat in Vietnam. Gen. LeMay said that they lost the war because the targets of B-52 bombers were being provided by President Lyndon Johnson every morning, instead of the Generals. He was making a good point. The political leadership did not set forth clear objectives for the military. 

Russia's political leadership has the same problem today. Whatever the Russian soldiers accomplish heroically, in the end, they are going to have an outcome that's unclear. 

**KAREN:** I can't imagine heroism by Russian soldiers. 

**ARTSRUN:** There are many instances of individual heroism.

**KAREN:** *(falls into depression deeper than Mariana Trench)*

**ARTSRUN:** But it's not just Russia. Western governments are also politically timid and cautious. 

**KAREN:** But the West has announced that it will support Ukraine until every Russian soldier leaves Ukraine.

**ARTSRUN:** What really counts is the level of delivered support. Ukraine has 24 HIMARs, not 200. They don't even have every caliber of missiles. The West is delivering soon-to-be-outdated types of missiles. Jets aren't there yet; they hesitated to send them in 2022. The West is politically cautious.

**KAREN:** The West doesn't want to escalate it into a direct conflict against Russia.

**ARTSRUN:** Exactly. That's why they are hesitant. 

**KAREN:** They are also dealing with MAGA people who [support isolationism]. If they ramp up the military support now, it could backfire.

**ARTSRUN:** You are confirming my point. The West is cautious and hesitant. The West is not arming Ukraine with both hands. They approved, then disapproved, then approved the supply of jets. 

Washington Post is telling fairy tales about Ukraine using 2,000,000 shells therefore ""that's too much, the U.S. doesn't have enough reserves"", yadda yadda. Tell that to children. The U.S. reserves were calculated to hold tens or hundreds of millions of munitions, and I'm confident they do. The size of reserves was calculated with the Cold War in mind. The U.S. left the Cold War with about 40,000 artillery units. 12,000 of them were preserved in great condition. They must have a sufficient number of munitions stored somewhere. They just aren't sure if they want to deliver them to Ukraine. 

**KAREN:** Is the West betraying Ukraine?

**ARTSRUN:** Not at all.

**KAREN:** There is a firm political decision in the West to help Ukraine win the war. How and when they deliver weapons depends on how many internal barriers they must go through.

9/11/2023,I have a serious question,"So we all seem to agree that the mullahs are one of the dumbest alive, having almost no knowledge over eat sleep repeat. So how does it seem like they have a PhD  when it comes to suppression and propaganda. I'm not talking about the obvious propaganda Noone buys I'm talking about this deep thing. For say one, every time a protest happens or massive uprising, in say like tabriz, they somehow make sure that the people of like Bandar abbas hear about it, and think it's separatism. Like when the protests started even here on reddit videos would be shown of a group of people shouting stuff ( out of context ) and then be related to separatism. And second is about leaders, and bear with me here, and understand that most of Iran doesn't have a revolution leader, and somehow the government tries to show that they do, and showcase the wrong people. Like notice that even tho the most dangerous person to the regime in the south east is Molavi and yet all the regime does is ignore him ( at least online ), but they seem to pay attention alot to RP, knowing full well a majority of Iranians don't like him, as if they're trying to make the people stuck in the middle of choosing bad or worst. And how any opposition other than him is either labeled IR spy or not Iranian, ( now if that's true or not is debatable ), and the other thing I notice is how anti Iranian some decisions and comments get, Arab hate, Latin alphabet, Muslim hate, praise usa, praise Israel. Even tho usa has done way to many crimes in the area to be trusted and Israel is supporting separatists in Azerbaijan. Notice that moment by moment crimes of the pahlavi monarchs get erased and forgotten about. Like the crimes that Reza shah did to the bakhtiari people. Or the whole savak era of  Mohammad reza shah, ( especially in this subreddit ) any circle jerky praise of the pahlavis is welcomed but as soon as someone says something against it, it's ""divisive"" and for those who don't remember in Dey reddit got banned in iran, and it was from there that most of these pahlavi circle jerk started. Notice how some of the most obvious heros of Iran get ignored, for say most of the iraq-iran wars most notable are the hate towards hemmat and jahanara. 


And the Iranian inside iran know that they don't like pahlavi, they know the heroism of these martyrs, they are aware but somehow, they get pushed in the minority category.

10/11/2020,Ethnic minority relations in Azerbaijan," 

Hello everyone, the recent events have made me think about some stuff that I haven't thought about before. I am mainly referring to the cringeworthy and idiotic armenian attempt at getting our Talish and Lezgi population to join their side. But the responses I observed, at least online, showed what a stupid move that was on behalf of Armenia (I know a lot of you armenians are reading this subreddit. So, I am interested in what kind of propaganda spin you will put to this fiasco ;) )I know that we have a long way to go to develop as a country, but I have always believed (and still do to a good extent) that our relations with our ethnic minorities are good and they are a well-integrated part of our country.That's why I am interested in what problems only our ethnic minorities (mainly Lezgins, Talysh and Avars) face in Azerbaijan. Since I grew up mostly in Baku as a regular azerbaijani without any specific minority identity that I am aware of, I didn't really have to think about this till now. From the  Minority Rights Group International website, I got some info that disappointed me a little:

*Lezgins expressed concern over under-representation in the Azerbaijani parliament (Milli Meclis) after a shift away from proportional representation in the parliamentary elections of November 2005. Lezgins had been represented by two members of parliament in the previous parliament, but are now represented by only one.*

*Lezgins state that they face discrimination and that they feel forced to assimilate into Azeri identity to avoid economic and education discrimination. Therefore, the real number of Lezgins may be significantly higher than presented in censuses. Lezgin is taught as a foreign language in areas where many Lezgins are settled, but teaching resources are scarce. Lezgin-language textbooks come from Russia and are not adapted to local conditions. Although Lezgin newspapers are available, Lezgins have also expressed concern over the disappearance of their rich oral tradition. The only Lezgin television broadcasting available in Azerbaijan is that received over the border from Russia.*

Considering this, I have a few questions for you Azerbaijanis of Lezgins, Avar, Talysh, etc. descent:

1. On a scale of 1-10, how much would you consider yourself belonging to Azerbaijan? Have you ever felt discriminated by regular Azerbaijani people (not at the government level)? My understanding is that most azerbaijanis see no difference between our Lezgi, Avar, Talysh, etc population and ""regular"" azerbaijanis and intermarriage between them is common. Would you consider this view of mine is correct?
2. And on the government level, do you personally know or indirectly have any information about our government policies to force any of you to assimilate? How good (or bad) would you rate the current situation? Do you think the situation has improved or worsened in the last decade?I just saw a few videos about textbooks being available in Lezgi and Talysh, how true are these? Is this a genuine improvement compared to the past?
3. If you had a magic wand to change a few things regarding Azerbaijan, what would you do? Would you rather create independent Lezgistan, Talyshistan or would you rather live in Azerbaijan where everyone's rights and languages are protected? Personally, if I had any power, I would gladly make sure that all of your languages are protected and you all have a choice to study it in schools. Personally, I despise nationalism and balkanization of any sort since it s a threat to stability and would like all ethnicities within our borders to feel welcome. In short, I'd love for Azerbaijan to be a secular country where all Caucasian people can easily integrate themselves into.

Thanks to all of you for your input. Feel free to add more information if you think I have missed something important. I apologize for my ignorance in this matter as I am no longer living in Azerbaijan for a decade already. I hope the situation for all of you will get better"
10/13/2021,I’m calling it now. Azerbaijan and war hawks are starting fabricate a claim that Iran invaded Azerbaijan during the second NK war to manufacture consent for potential future war against Iran,"Isn’t it interesting how this story came out a year after the war ended and right as tensions between Iran and Azerbaijan are at an all time high? This is just the tip of the iceberg. A few American mouthpieces, probably on Aliyev’s payroll, are doing nothing but pumping out propaganda aimed at taking things out of context, demonizing Iranians, distorting facts, or spreading made up information.

""Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause""(Isaiah 1:17)

Hello,

This  may seem like a random request, and while i don't know what can be done  for this dire situation, as we say in Romania, ""you don't know from  where the hare jumps"", so i hope the Almighty guides it to where it's  needed.

So, what happened?

In  short, during the recent 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the  territories surrounding the famous mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh enclave  were retaken by azeri forces, under the condition that their only  connection with the rest of the region, and Armenia proper, the Lachin  corridor, was maintained.

Starting  with the 12th of December 2022, said corridor was severed by the  government in Baku, preventing any food, water or medical supplies from  reaching the area(as well as gas, but that was restored after a couple  of days).

Given it is a  mountainous enclave, self-sufficiency is not possible, which means more  than 120,000 people have been left isolated, without food or water, for  the past 2 weeks, in the middle of winter, which has already led to  deaths, and the very real probability of mass starvation, if this  continues.

Such actions,  especially done for ethnic reasons, bear the tell-tale marks of ethnic  cleansing and genocide, and will lead to worse, if action is not taken,  especially given [previous Nazi Germany-like behaviour](https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/12442/azerbaijan-stamps-nagorno-karabakh-war-anti-armenian-propaganda) of [azeri state institutions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramil_Safarov#Extradition_and_pardon)

Still, i ask you to do whatever you can to help prevent this calamity, this Christmas, for Christ's sake.

10/3/2021,Message to all Persian lurkers here about South Azerbaijan,"Stop spreading ""we are all Iranian family"" non-sense here, please. Underestimating the growth of ethnic identity of Azerbaijanis won't make the problem disappear or get solved. It reminds me ""we are Soviet family"" propaganda which had been effectively used till 1988 when Soviet censorship ceased to exist and all people started talking out loud about all the injustice that happened to them. People who ""proudly"" marched in 1988's Baku celebrating Soviet annexation of Azerbaijan, 2 years later burned their passports in the very Baku streets. 

The same censorship works today in Iran. No difference for us. Btw, North Azerbaijanis had much more rights and comfort in USSR under Godless Communists than the South ones have today in Iran under their Shia ""bro"" Persians. 

P.S no one says every Azerbaijani in Iran hates Iran. Indeed, there are many religious brainwashed zombies among Iranian Azerbaijanis as much as among Persians. But Persians better than anyone else know that there are much more people suffering from the injustice committed by these backward mullahs. 

The point we mention here is the presence of Pan-Turkism and separatist movement in Iran which is fastly growing. While Persians just prefer to ignore and underestimate the issue and imprison any Azerbaijani trying to demand their basic ethic rights, the separatist movement will collapse one day in Iran. Karabakh conflict didn't start one beautiful day out of nowhere. It developed slowly from simple gestures of nationalism between neighbors/ basic street fights and ended in pogroms and massacres while Moscow still tried to call Armenians and Azerbaijanis ""two brotherly nations""."

First and foremost, you've already seen this [garbage](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/t7rjlp/this_is_shameful/) in main sub, that despite breaking rules of sub, of course isn't getting removed. 

The OP of that post is, how to put it, smooth brain. And here is why

# Reason 1: Ukraine was always pro-Azeri and stays so

During 2nd Artsakh war Ukraine was vocal in [its support for Baku](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/ukraine-supports-azerbaijans-territorial-integrity/1993930). For instance, Zelensky (now portrayed by Western mass media as ""hero"") said: 

> ""We support Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and sovereignty just as Azerbaijan always supports our territorial integrity and sovereignty,""   
>  
> The crisis between the two countries should be prevented from turning into a ""frozen"" conflict and that the problems should be resolved quickly. 

The very same Zelensky also said, that [Kiev won't provide arms to both parties](https://ua.interfax.com.ua/news/general/692615.html)

> ""Ukraine calls on Armenia and Azerbaijan to de-escalate the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. There can be no question of providing military assistance by Ukraine to any of the parties to the conflict,"" 

Despite Zelensky's saying he won't provide arms to both parties and later denying arms transfers to Baku [deeming that news to be ""Russian propaganda""](https://www.cbrnenation.com/news/zelensky-dismisses-fake-news-about-ukraine-selling-chemical-weapons-to-azerbaijan/), Hetq published [article](https://hetq.am/en/article/122341) that Azeri cargos from Silk Way Airlines (used often by NATO to transport weaponry and Baku itself to get drones and other arms to Azerbaijan) as well as Azeri Air force continued flying to Turkey, Israel and Ukraine via Georgia's airspace (that claimed it was closed for ""all military transfers"").  In its other article, [Hetq says](https://hetq.am/en/article/123302) Azeri cargos Boeing 747 flew to Kiev in October 15 and October 18-19. 

Later, on October 31 we saw Azeri forces using white phoshporus against Artsakh's army with Arman Tatoyan (hated by nikolacunts like bozmard) [publishing video evidence](https://en.armradio.am/2020/10/31/azerbaijan-using-phosphorus-munitions-against-civilians-in-artsakh-ombudsman/). 

What is more, after war ended many Ukrainian cities were full of pro-Azeri propaganda like the one in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/t7t1d9/this_is_shameful/). The post has only one photo, so let me post below some more billboards from Ukraine that promote Azeri agenda

&#x200B;

[This says - Day of Glorious Azeri Victory and below Crimea and Donbass are Ukraine, Karabakh is Azerbaijan](https://preview.redd.it/r4amkh9k8rl81.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60cb68ec0092741d52e4a8016d53d27fd60c1997)

&#x200B;

[Basically same garbage](https://preview.redd.it/g8y84gtt8rl81.jpg?width=891&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2fc5a27a371d225e985770e96824aa1b9e03861)

So, on state level Kiev supported Azeris, provided them with weapons such as white phosphorus as well as glorified their role in war. 

# Reason 2: Close Turkish-Ukraine cooperation and providing Bayraktars even during Russia's operation

First, a little lesson from history. 

When Azeris were using Turkish Bayraktar drones and other Turkish weaponry under command from Turkish Generals, Erdogan in October 2020 visited Kiev and [signed a number of military agreements](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2020/10/16/Turkey-s-Erdogan-and-Ukraine-s-Zelenskiy-sign-military-agreements).

Zelensky then said:

> “Cooperation in the defense industry is important for the development of our strategic partnership and I am happy that we are strengthening it today, 

Erdogan, in his turn claimed:

> “Turkey sees Ukraine as a key country for the establishment (of) stability, security, peace and prosperity in the region,”   “Turkey has not recognized Crimea’s illegal annexation and it never will,” 

Zelensky also awarded Erdogan with state medal for his support for Ukraine’s “territorial integrity.” 

That was in October 2020.

Now, in 2022, [Ukraine received a fresh batch of Bayraktars](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2022/03/03/ukraine-receives-fresh-supplies-of-bayraktar-drones-and-anti-tank-weapons/?sh=4ffd6402359a) from Turkey because most of their drone fleet was either shot down or destroyed on airbases. What is more, several Armenian tg channels spotted using Flightradar cargo flights from Turkey to Poland proving Ankara keeps sending military hardware to Ukraine. Same Ukraine that bozmard, turkocapitalist and others from major sub support. 

# Reason 3 Azerbaijan now supports Kiev

 We all know, that Baku has strict control on its society and that any big rallies like anti-Armenian, Anti-Russian and Anti-Iranian rallies in 2020 can be only organized if they are directly approved by Baku. Knowing this fact, take a good look at large rally in front [of Ukraine's embassy](https://oc-media.org/azerbaijanis-take-to-the-streets-against-russian-invasion/). 

Azeris gathered there showed their support for Kiev and chanted:  Ukraine!’, ‘No to war!’, ‘Reject Putin!’, ‘Love Ukraine!’, ‘Ukrainian people, Azerbaijani people are with you!’, ‘Putin, get out!’, ‘Russia without Putin! Basically pro-Ukrainian stance.

Same Azerbaijan also said it will [send aid to Kiev](https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/azerbaijan-sends-humanitarian-aid-to-war-hit-ukraine-vows-to-supply-ambulances-with-fuel-free-of-charge-2022-2-28-0/). Zelensky posted in his Twitter saying that aliyev instructed Azerbaijan’s state-run oil company [SOCAR](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1497638775027122179?s=20&t=wwinlNmZiDbzeEoi35ZQPw) to supply the ambulances and vehicles of the State Emergency Service with fuel free of charge in its gasoline stations in Ukraine. Important to note, oil and oil supply is vital for Kiev and their military since majority of their oil reserves were hit in first 5-6 days of military operation by Kalibr cruise missiles.

What is more, unlike Armenia that now sees influx of Russian tourists and businessmen, Azeris suspended [all flights to Russia.](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/azerbaijan-airlines-suspends-all-flights-to-russia-amid-putins-aggression-in-ukraine-articleshow.html)

# Reason 4 Russian military presence is the only guarantee Armenians can now live in Stepanakert and Dadivank along with Amaras monastery aren't ""Albanized"" 

I will just [copy](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/t7rjlp/comment/hzjputn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) this great comment under smooth-brain OP's post

>Reading these comments, I swear Armenians living in the West lack the cognitive empathy that even unschooled infants and toddlers are capable of.  
>  
>The people of Artsakh were/are grateful that Russia decided to even send peacekeepers at all. Better late than never, better some help than none at all. If Aliyev wanted, he could have easily taken what was left of Karabakh and the international community would not have given a damn. We 'lucked out' that Russia still wants the conflict to continue in order to have leverage in the region, sell guns to both sides etc., hence why they decided to save our asses the last minute and secure what had yet to be taken by Aliyev.  
>  
>Right now those Russian peacekeepers are the only things standing in between Artsakh citizens safety and total annihilation at the hands of the Azeri military. So yeah, the people there are happy and fucking relieved that the peacekeepers are there, at least for the next decade. It's much better than the alternative of them being cleansed from their homes or killed.  
>  
>Do you fish think Aliyev likes having Russian soldiers in what most of the hypocritical world recognizes as Azeri borders? Once the Russians Put in (pun intended), they rarely pull out. Aliyev now has to find a way to get the peacekeepers to leave if he is to achieve his goal of conquering karabakh. In the meantime, at least that gives us time. Time to rebuild, time to fix our armies etc.  
>  
>If there were no peacekeepers, if Russia didn't decide to send peacekeepers the last minute, all, rather than half of Artsakh would have been gone and God knows we would have never been able to get it back.  
>  
>Right now, the people of Artsakh have to play their politics, be diplomatic, and provide every single reason for Russia to stay. Unlike you in your comfortable homes far from a conflict zone, their life depends on it. Instead of calling it shameful, grow a heart and learn to empathize.  
>  
>As for Russia selling guns to Azerbaijan... Russia's response is if I don't do it, someone else will (Israel, Turkey, Europe, China) etc. I'd prefer Azeris buy Russian weaponry over NATO weaponry because we actually know how to fight Russian weaponry, especially hand me down soviet stuff. The T-70s and 90s weren't a problem during the war, the bayraktars were. Azerbaijan spends 2-3 billion on their military each year, and I'd prefer for the bulk of that to go to buying weapons that we actually have a chance of beating and repelling.  
>  
>Also, if Russia were to ever invade Azerbaijan because of Azerbaijan doing something drastic like canceling all Russian weapon purchases or moving closer to NATO (like Ukraine) the world would immediately jump to Azerbaijan's side and aid. We don't want that.

I'll just add to this from my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hayastan/comments/snmcjr/artsakh_historic_heritage_and_russian_peacekeepers/) of how Russian peacekeepers increased interest in Armenian heritage of Artsakh and along with Artsakh's servicemen checked Azeri trucks aka de-facto recognizing Artsakh.

&#x200B;

# Reason 5 LPR and DPR struggle is similar to that of Artsakh

It has to be noted that Russian people's struggle in LPR and DPR is a lot similar to that of people in Artsakh. How?

Well, after pro-Western coup in Kiev, new govt. was pursuing anti-Russian policy.

 On February 23, 2014, immediately after the coup d'etat, the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) of Ukraine voted to repeal the law ""On the Basics of State Language policy"". The document granted the Russian language and the languages of national minorities the status of regional in those areas where they are native to at least 10% of the population.  
On September 5, 2017, the Parliament of Ukraine adopted a new version of the law ""On Education"". Education in secondary schools and higher educational institutions should be conducted exclusively in the Ukrainian language.  
According to the new law ""On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language"", the only official state language in the country is Ukrainian. The Ukrainian language will be mandatory for all media, including online publications. The share of the state language on national channels should be at least 90%, and on regional channels - at least 80%. From January 2022, language quotas for national print media will begin to operate, from July 2024 - for television. 

Those who disagreed, faced violence and death. Like [people in Odessa in 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0mgpwW6_Y&ab_channel=RT) who were burned alive just because they disagreed with  oppression of Russians or [bombing civilians in city of Luhansk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBHNuAziLdM&ab_channel=RT%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC) in 2014.

In my view, this all is similar to what we saw in Sumgait, Baku and what was done during war meaning bombing of civilians in Stepanakert, bombing of Kazanchecoc Church in Shushi and e.t.c. That is why it isn't suprising why Kiev and Baku have same stance

&#x200B;

# Reason 6 Ukraine and gifts they got from Bolsheviks

Lastly, in his speech before military operation, Putin rightfully said that current Ukraine as we know it was basically created by Bolsheviks and Soviet Union, who gave to them historic Russian lands like that of Donbass, Novorossya, Crimea. 

Doesn't this ring a bell? Well, there is another state that got a lot of gifts by same Bolsheviks (aka Lenin and his buddies) - Azerbaijan that didn't exist in Russian Empire (unlike that of Armenian oblast) that got such territories as Artsakh and Nakhichevan when Lenin was playing friendly games with Ataturk. If Yerevan is wise enough, same rhetoric can and shoud be adopted and used by Armenia to further liberation of Armenian historic lands.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

&#x200B;

Given all above mentioned facts, Western Armenian at least should stay neutral, not assuming anti-Russian position and agenda since Ukraine is allied with Turkey and Azeris and struggle of Russians in DPR and LPR is similar to that of Artsakh. Some may say, but hey, Russia signed ally agreement with Azerbaijan. Yes it did, but if you care enough to read that document and analyze it using critical thinking you can see, it doesn't add up anything new to the existing level of relations and has no legally binding things (apart from term ""ally"") whereas Russo-Armenian relations are defined in bilateral defense treaty and CSTO (whole other level of relations).

**I know, people in the West consume a lot of Western mass media that has one-sided anti-Russian agenda that shapes their anti-Russian view. But, please, use critical thinking, don't fall prey to anti-Russian propaganda and do not jump on that band wagon of blaming everything Russian, especially since Russia is the only guarantor of Armenia's security, modernizes Armenia's military and guarantees security in Artsakh.**

8/26/2021,Taliban Takes Power in Afghanistan: Consequences for Armenia,"At first glance, Afghanistan is far from the South Caucasus, but the events taking place there can have a negative impact on socio-economic processes outside its borders.

The seizure of power by the Taliban is fraught with such challenges as the propaganda of terrorism, uncontrolled migration, separatism, and the growth of drug trafficking. All this requires an increase in security measures and the maintenance of law and order. Armenia is no exception.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8h966gp76pj71.jpg?width=420&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=baab0c89b908682b9a840b9d80d4b6a07c75ca9d

Experts predict that the victory of the Taliban will inevitably lead to the emergence of a new Islamist movement in the world. In addition, it opens up a new perspective for Turkey's long-term game in the Central Asian region. Turkey may become the only NATO country officially working with the Taliban, who are recognized as terrorists. Time will tell if it will be agreed with the US, or if Turkey will prefer to play its game together with Pakistan and Azerbaijan, in spite of Washington. How strongly the events in Afghanistan will affect Armenia depends on this.

After the withdrawal of the United States, Afghanistan actually comes under the control of Pakistan and its allied China. The incident opens the way for the Pakistanis to Central Asia. The interests of the five nuclear powers now converge in this region: Pakistan, India, China, Russia, and the United States. Iran, whose nuclear technology is also at a high level, can be added to this list.

Meanwhile, positive changes in the Armenian-Pakistani relations are hardly possible in the foreseeable future.

Now the Taliban is starting to work on their international image. But they cannot but kill, they cannot stop growing drugs, stop selling them.

The change of power in Afghanistan will not directly affect the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. If the Taliban succeed in achieving recognition by the world community, then, most likely, they will support Azerbaijan in international and regional platforms. Afghanistan, together with Azerbaijan, participates in a number of regional organizations, including the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Organization for Economic Cooperation (it includes Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan).

In general, relations between Azerbaijan and Afghanistan will continue after the change of power in Kabul. The Lazurite transport corridor (Lapis-Lazuli corridor: Afghanistan-Turkmenistan-Caspian-Azerbaijan-Georgia) passes through Azerbaijan, which is one of the shortest routes from Afghanistan to Europe.

Meanwhile, the military-political leadership of Armenia and the expert political science community are closely following the events, because the changes in Afghanistan, that will lead to changes in Central Asia and also affect the situation in the Caucasus."

The EU has called on Azerbaijan to take the measures that are within its jurisdiction to ensure freedom and security of movement along the corridor, in line with its obligations deriving from the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020,” Borrell said.

“In accordance with the agreement reached in Prague on 6 October 2022, the EU Monitoring Capacity was deployed to Armenia for a maximum of two months and completed its activities on 19 December 2022. The EU has started a new phase of engagement with the decision to establish, in response to Armenia’s request, a civilian European Union mission in Armenia (EUMA) under the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). The objective of the mission is to contribute to stability in the border areas of Armenia, build confidence on the ground, and ensure an environment conducive to normalization efforts between Armenia and Azerbaijan supported by the EU,” the High Commissioner said.

He noted that “sanctions are only one of the EU’s tools to promote the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and are not being considered in this case.”

“The EU’s efforts with Armenia and Azerbaijan are focused on achieving solutions through dialogue, to which the leaders of both countries have expressed their commitment,” Josep Borrell stressed

#Armenia’s Ambassador to brief Canadian MPs on Lachin corridor blockade

""On January 25, 2023, the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development convened two separate meetings on Azerbaijan’s ongoing blockade of Artsakh.""

""The meetings were organized following last week’s unanimous passage of a motion presented to the committee by Bloc Quebecois’ Shadow Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, which called for a maximum of three meetings, during which the committee would have the opportunity to hear from witnesses representing the Republic of Artsakh, as well as experts and community representatives.""

""This was a historic achievement, considering that for the first time, it provided an opportunity for Artsakh state representatives to appear in front of the Canadian Parliament and make the case for the 120,000 besieged Armenians of Artsakh and their struggle to live as they choose.""

""During the first meeting, ANCC’s Co-President Shahen Mirakian appeared alongside Dr. Taline Papazian (Lecturer at Sciences Po, École de l’Air), Robert Avetisyan (Republic of Artsakh’s Permanent Representative to the US & Canada) and Gegham Stepanyan (Human Rights Defender of the Republic of Artsakh).

#UN Special Rapporteurs send letter to Baku on atrocities committed by Azerbaijan during aggression against Armenia

""The Mandates of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, its causes and consequences and the Working Group on discrimination against women and girls published the letter because Azerbaijan failed to respond to their query within the defined period of time (60 days).""

""The Special Rapporteurs noted that what had happened could amount to various war crimes in contravention of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, of which Azerbaijan is a party. “The killing of POWs or detained civilians captured during or in the context of combat, is strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law, and if confirmed, may constitute war crimes. Similarly, conduct that endangers protected persons or objects or violates important values, such as by the disrespectful handling of human remains corpses, may also constitute war crimes. Azerbaijan has the duty to treat any Armenian detainees humanely and without discrimination in full compliance with its obligations under international humanitarian law.”

""Azerbaijan is also violating the protection against discrimination and violence against women contained in article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, ratified by Azerbaijan on 10 July 1995; and the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health contained in article 12 and 2.2 of the 4 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which Azerbaijan also acceded to on 13 August 1992.""

""Thus, being a party to the UN fundamental documents, Azerbaijan is grossly violating them and doesn’t cooperate with the highly important bodies supervising the human rights such as the mandated UN special rapporteurs. Furthermore, Azerbaijan doesn’t take into consideration the tasks given by the UN bodies.""

""The UN special rapporteurs who signed the letter are expressing deep concern around the presented cases and are calling on Azerbaijan to take all possible measures to end such violations, prevent their repetition and ensure that all those responsible for the crimes are held to account.""

""The UN Human Rights Council special rapporteurs also noted that they haven’t received a response from Azerbaijan on the factual and legal reasons for not releasing prisoners of war after the ceasefire in November of 2020.

""Armenia has placed mines in its sovereign territory for purely defensive purposes, taking into account repeated acts of aggression by Azerbaijan. Armenia does not place mines outside its sovereign territory, especially in civilian areas, and does not attempt to target citizens based on race. Azerbaijan collected the mines it is complaining about from the sovereign territory of Armenia, which was occupied by the Azerbaijani armed forces in 2021-2022. Therefore, Azerbaijan is trying to create a false evidence base based on the mines it collected after its illegal acts of aggression to justify its claim. This claim is groundless.

#Armenia does not have military units in Nagorno Karabakh – legislator debunks Azerbaijan’s accusations at UN

(part of the interview, you can read more in the link)

""The groundless claims made by the Permanent Representative of Azerbaijan to the United Nations have nothing to do with reality. These are again unsuccessful attempts to “justify” Azerbaijan’s belligerent, maximalist and destructive positions and their blockade of Nagorno Karabakh for already 48 days, and the policy of subjecting the Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh to ethnic cleansing. All claims made by the Permanent Representative of Azerbaijan are debunked with facts. Armenia had officially announced earlier in 2022 that there are no units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia in Nagorno Karabakh. In order to verify this claim, the Prime Minister of Armenia had even proposed to send an international fact-finding mission to Nagorno Karabakh, which Azerbaijani President Aliyev himself rejected. It would be logical for Azerbaijan to have had agreed to this proposal, however their rejection shows that this all is simply a propaganda trick by Azerbaijan. Certainly, Nagorno Karabakh has self-defense armed forces, the necessity of which is substantiated for the protection of the local population from Azerbaijan’s aggressive and ethnic cleansing policy. As a sign of goodwill and humanism, the Republic of Armenia unilaterally conveyed to Azerbaijan the minefield maps which it possessed. And this happened in conditions when the Armenian side did not have such an obligation neither under the trilateral statements nor international law. Furthermore, Armenia expressed readiness to support, in cooperation with international partners, in the process of decrypting the maps which were conveyed. It is also an important fact that the landmines were laid in Nagorno Karabakh and adjacent regions as early as during the First Nagorno Karabakh War, mostly by Azerbaijan, and access of respective international organizations for de-mining works into the region was impeded by Azerbaijan itself.""

#Azerbaijan's claim is neither sincere nor real. Armenia asks the International Court to reject it

""As the legal advisers have shown, Azerbaijan's request for interim measures is an insincere and unrealistic request. It is designed to create a false impression of equality. Based on the oral presentations, Armenia respectfully asks the Court to completely reject Azerbaijan's request for interim measures,"" Kirakosyan said.""

""On January 30, the hearings of Armenia's claim against Azerbaijan were held at the UN International Court of Justice.""

#Tour guides in Armenia to undergo qualification process to meet standards, new bill under development

""Hakobyan said the changes are aimed at bringing the businesses of the sector into the framework of regulations. “Under the new law certification processes will be introduced as well. A mandatory certification process will be in place for tour guides, and a voluntary certification process for hotel business entities and tour bus operators,” Hakobyan said.""

""Financial guarantees will be stipulated for outbound travel agents and tour operators.""

""The certification (licensing) process is aimed at developing standards and criteria for the tour guides and accommodation services. “Unfortunately, today there are tour guides, hotel businesses and also travel agencies who don’t comply in any way to any standards, I’m not talking only about international standards. And the changes proposed in our law are aimed at solving these problems,” Hakobyan said.""

""The certification process for hotel businesses will be delegated to an authorized body chosen by the government. International standards will be localized in implementing all processes.""

8/2/2023,"Minister's mysterious trip to Meghri || Iskander vs Azeri airport || Armenia importing ""Indian HIMARS"" & French weapons || $100m for domestic mil. industry || Draft never stopped during war || Samvel Babayan's plan || Nagorno-Karabakh's secret negotiation || Little-known clashes before July","##wartime defense minister Davit Tonoyan was questioned by War Commission 

Tonoyan has been in jail for two years. He is accused of knowingly delivering ""bad"" missiles, an accusation he denies.

##... your location on the eve of the war?

**TONOYAN:** I was in a NATO country to discuss the import of weapons. On the 27th I arrived in Kazakhstan to also discuss a weapons deal. Because of COVID, it took me 3 hours to find a jet to return. 

I encountered difficulties during the flight. My jet was forced to enter Armenia through Georgia. I landed on the 28th and visited the ""bunker"" headquarters in Nagorno-Karabakh.

##... describe the bunker, who can get there?

**TONOYAN:** The bunker has multiple rooms including areas for outsiders without a security clearance. There were also special rooms with information designed to mislead the opponent. The room where secret decisions were made was not accessible to outsiders. You may have seen images of outsiders in the bunker but they weren't present during classified meetings.

##... who is Patron Davo?

**TONOYAN:** A magician who used land and air routes to make weapons appear in Armenia.

##... Turkish airforce

**TONOYAN:** Turkey sent its F-16 jets to Azerbaijan in July 2020 for military drills. They remained in Azerbaijan afterward. And the fact they were stationed so close to Nagorno-Karabakh was concerning.

Every day, around 4 jets would spend 4-8 hours in the air and fly just 25 km from Nagorno-Karabakh. They had a rotation schedule. The jets were flying so close that they would occasionally trigger the air defense systems. We could shoot them down but Russia discouraged any ""provocations"".

##... describe Turkey's involvement in the war

**TONOYAN:** They were a direct participant, not even a ""proxy"". Their F-16 jets exposed our entire air-defense system. Turkish airforce is considered quite developed even within NATO because they were one of the first to develop a unified command & intel system within the airforce. This, in turn, was connected to NATO's command & observation system. What that meant for our army can be discussed behind closed doors.

##... Armenian drones 

**TONOYAN:** We entered the war with only 6 aircraft-style drones. Nothing substantial was accomplished by the domestic mil. industry.

##... is it true that Israel planned to sell drones to Armenia?

**TONOYAN:** No. There were attempts by private entities to make arrangements but it didn't work because Israel had very large weapons contracts with Azerbaijan.

##... did you modify the Serj-era weapons purchase plan to lower the priority of drones and TOR?

**TONOYAN:** No. This perception was formed due to a lack of knowledge. No weapons have ""substituted"" others, and no weapons were given ""priority"" over others. There was an effort to *supplement* the [Serj-era] list, to acquire more than what was planned. [corraborates with claims made by Artsrun Hovhannisyan and Pashinyan]

For example, the number of air-defense units that we acquired was 20% greater than what was envisaged under the original plan. 

##... OSA-AK air-defense 

**COMMISSION:** Is the opposition wrong in their accusations that the Pashinyan administration came and suspended Serj's plans to acquire certain weapons? 

**TONOYAN:** Again, nothing was removed from the list, we only added new items. We bought multiple OSA-AK units because there was a sudden opportunity to buy them. They performed very well during the war. They were an add-on item. 

The original plan did not envisage OSA-AK because their price was too expensive at the time. We later saw an opportunity to buy them as a package at a steep discount.

##... what about TOR air-defense units?

**TONOYAN:** Similarly, we acquired several TOR units during a period when *fewer* TOR purchases were envisaged under the original plan. This was made possible through skillful negotiations and access to funds. 

##... is it true that an unprecedented number of army vehicles were imported before the war?

**TONOYAN:** I don't know if it's ""unprecedented"" but the state had placed orders for a large number of vehicles. Some of them arrived before and during the war. We encountered significant import barriers even while importing vehicles. Their shape and color were an issue. 

##... electronic warfare

**COMMISSION:** Before the war, why did you order the dissolution of all electronic warfare units in every single Army Corps, and disassemble their modern equipment?

**TONOYAN:** CoGS recommended that after detailed discussions. All I can say is even that ""modern equipment"" had a subpar performance. Not enough units, and ineffective. Maybe because of insufficient quantity, maybe because we couldn't utilize them properly. 

**COMMISSION:** You also gave the order to dissolve the central battalion tasked with anti-aircraft warfare. Our SPN-30 and SPN-40 units were supposed to combat drones, F-16 jets, or E-7 control aircraft units. Instead, they were removed from combat duty and destroyed. These were basically the older versions of Krasukha. 

**TONOYAN:** The import of newer units was underway. The department tasked with that process can provide details.

##... cutting the reserves

**COMMISSION:** Before the war, why did you eliminate the main reserves of the 1st Army Corps in the direction of Goris and Kapan?

**TONOYAN:** [Former] CoGS [Artak Davtyan] recommended it. We eliminated those reserves and formed tens of special forces units in their place. That's much better than having those reserves ""on paper"".

**COMMISSION:** [New] CoGS Onik Gasparyan regretted that decision.

##... did we need to purchase SU-30SM jets?

**TONOYAN:** Yes. The ratio of balance between Armenia and Azerbaijan in that department was zero to X. We had nothing. We also had no capability to carry out guided precision strikes on targets located far away. We've never had this before. SU-30SM was a purchase for our future.

The decision to acquire SU-30SM was originally made in 2015 but we didn't have the funds at the time. We ended up buying them [after 2018] with resources allocated from *outside* of the state budget. The Government report mentions that nuance but doesn't clarify what those ""non-budgetary resources"" mean. I can discuss that behind closed doors. *[Wasn't it something about using funds recovered by anti-corruption efforts, paid by former leaders?]*

The acquisition of SU-30SM did not prevent other weapons from being purchased. [It was earlier revealed that Armenia wanted to buy TOR units and drones but couldn't find a seller who could deliver them or deliver quickly enough, prompting the government to search for temporary alternatives without suspending the pending TOR/drone contracts.]

Additionally, we signed a Su-25 modernization contract with Russia that was supposed to take 3 years. I don't know if this process is underway or has been suspended due to the war in Ukraine. 

##... myth: draft was suspended prematurely

Context: Pashinyan has denied issuing an order to suspend the regular draft to replace it with volunteers. It was against the law to draft men who had just completed their mandatory 2-year conscription service, so Pashinyan said he used a ""loophole"" to recruit those men by inviting them as volunteers instead. Thousands of men, including Pashinyan's son, ended up joining as volunteers. It was later revealed and confirmed by an independent figure that the Armenian armies had amassed over 117,000 soldiers.

**COMMISSION:** Is it true that the official draft was stopped?

**TONOYAN:** No. The draft was never stopped. I think this manipulation is tied to the process of recruiting volunteers. There were serious issues with the draft which we can discuss behind closed doors. The main issue is that it was inherited from the 1946-1960 USSR, which had a different demographic and battlefields. This is why we launched a process to implement the idea of Active Reserves in Armenia.

**COMMISSION:** Were the reservists properly trained and harmonized with the regular army before being sent to the frontline?

**TONOYAN:** It can take months to retrain reservists properly. The entire war lasted only 44 days, so draw your conclusions. But we did have a training process, which was made longer over time. 

##... how many deserters and draft evaders did we have?

**TONOYAN:** Let's talk behind closed doors. I believe that had the war continued, we could overcome this issue because the relevant legal structures were finally starting to properly address the issue. I'm not saying the war should have continued.

**COMMISSION:** Why did we have many deserters?

**TONOYAN:** To overcome fear the soldier must be trained and prepared. Not enough preparatory work could be done because everything was unfolding quickly. 

##... resilience & threat assessment 

**TONOYAN:** According to our comprehensive calculations, which were done on multiple occasions, the Armenian army could withstand an attack by an enemy 3x its size. 

On the 3rd day of the war, considering Turkey's involvement, the Government was advised to try to negotiate a ceasefire. None of the military's prior threat assessments [2008-2010 and 2016-2018] considered a scenario in which Turkey would attack from the east. At the time of the [2016-2018 threat assessment], the geopolitical situation was different [likely refers to Russia-Turkey relations in Syria].

Our military ties with Russia also made us believe that Turkey itself would not be a direct threat. When Turkey deployed its jets in Azerbaijan's Ganja airport after the drills in Nakhijevan, I held several meetings with representatives from 12 NATO member states in an attempt to neutralize the Turkish threat. 

##... bulletproof vests 

**COMMISSION:** Were you satisfied with the state of the army at the time of your appointment as MOD? You were a ranking MOD official for years before your appointment. It turned out we were in poor shape: Improper control system for mobilized troops; lack of a digitized database of reservists; insufficient number of helmets and vests, which led to mild injuries becoming deadly and costing many lives; critically low stockpile of missiles as of May 2018 as revealed by Pashinyan. 

**TONOYAN:** I wasn't satisfied or dissatisfied with the work. The army is a living organism, it evolves and improves. The May 2018 assessment told us we could withstand an attack by a 3x greater force.

As for the vests and helmets, we had enough for active-duty soldiers but not for that many reservists. This is why our 2018-2019 report mentioned the need to purchase them. Importing vests and helmets is as difficult as importing a tank because of the same logistics/transfer restrictions. 

**COMMISSION:** Why not import ""civilian"" bulletproof vests designed for cops? I understand those aren't designed for military use but wouldn't that be better than having reservists with sweatpants and tees? [conversation is interrupted]

##... why wasn't the army brought to the highest state of combat readiness on the eve of the war?

**TONOYAN:** I believe the CoGS issued certain orders. It was in accordance with the level of perceived threat.

**COMMISSION:** What was the level of perceived threat? Give us a % number. 

**TONOYAN:** I can't give a specific number. It's either ""strongly likely"" or ""fully likely"". The threat was ""strongly likely"" after the July clashes. 

**COMMISSION:** Before the war you met with Russia's MOD Shoygu, while CoGS Onik met Russia's CoGS Gerasimov. Did your Russian colleagues tell you a major war was *unlikely* to happen?

**TONOYAN:** Let's talk about this behind closed doors. They asked us not to make provocative moves. 

##... July 2020 clashes weren't the first

**TONOYAN:** Our soldiers performed exceptionally well. I'll disclose more details. A few months before the July events there were other clashes on the AM-AZ border, regarding the need to strengthen Armenia's energy security. It was mostly the same army units that participated. It wasn't Armenia who publicized these events. The tactical-level clashes in July were overblown into strategic-level news by Azerbaijan. 

**COMMISSION:** Do you believe Armenia ""provoked"" the September war?

**TONOYAN:** We maybe ""delayed"" it or ""expedited"" it, but did not cause it. We were forced to take action *within* our borders. The response by Azerbaijan and Turkey was very disproportionate.

##... Crapstitutional reforms

**COMMISSION:** You said we had issues with the command system.

**TONOYAN:** Many legal uncertainties regarding the roles of officials and institutions during war and peace. 

##... where is MoD supposed to be located during the war?

**TONOYAN:** In the Defense Ministry headquarters. On October 21-29, I was in Meghri under the instructions of Pashinyan. Only now do I fully understand why he sent me there. As you know, Pashinyan recently revealed the existence of a ceasefire proposal that would have stationed Russian peacekeepers in Meghri [to give a corridor to Azerbaijan. Pashinyan rejected the offer. It was around October 19. The war continued.]

**COMMISSION:** What exactly were you ordered to do in Meghri?

**TONOYAN:** Our troops had sustained heavy casualties, the mayor of Meghri and the head of the Meghri military unit were wounded, and we were in the process of forming a special command system for the Southern region. My arrival had a positive psychological effect on the population and troops. 

I also witnessed how the Russian Border Guard positions were bombed. We were able to establish a serious plan of cooperation with them. I'm very grateful for that.

##... why didn't Armenia use Iskander to destroy the parked drones and jets in Azeri airports as soon as possible?

**TONOYAN:** ""Sooner or later"" is a decision made by the command. These missiles were used whenever possible and whenever allowed, and whenever they were authorized from the appropriate geographical location. *[cough Russia cough?]*

**COMMISSION:** Was Armenia NOT ALLOWED to use certain types of weapons?

**TONOYAN:** Let's discuss that behind closed doors. Hmmmm.......... but let me put it this way: We could use them but there were limitations with the geography. *[Azerbaijan possibly lobbied Russia to prevent the use of Iskanders against the territory of Azerbaijan. Perhaps they could only be used against Azeris who entered Nagorno-Karabakh? This could explain why it was used in Shushi.]*

**COMMISSION:** Did Russia ""pressure"" Armenia to agree to certain conditions so the war could end ASAP?

**TONOYAN:** Let's talk behind closed doors. But do know that the war stopped only because Russia brought its peacekeepers to Nagorno-Karabakh, not because of ""ceasefire agreements"".

**COMMISSION:** Why didn't Russia bring its peacekeepers sooner? 

##... can Armenia acquire weapons from NATO while being a member of CSTO?

**TONOYAN:** Yes. We have always imported weapons from NATO members. CSTO was never a dealbreaker. 
The real issue is with the ""compatibility"" of NATO weapons with our systems. Preparatory work is necessary.

##interview with Nagorno-Karabakh opposition leader Gen. Samvel Babayan || Secretly agreed to remove tanks || Rubern Vardanyan's ambitions || ...

Context: Babayan has been in favor of launching direct talks with Baku without a third party to discuss humanitarian topics including the use of the unpopular Aghdam road in addition to the Lachin Corridor. Babayan said that during the 1st Karabakh war, after Azerbaijan found itself in a dire state, they sent a letter to Armenia ""begging"" to use a similar road for humanitarian purposes. Babayan criticized his fellow opposition figures and Arayik Harutyunyan's government for engaging in ""traitor talk"" and avoiding responsibility and harsh realities. *""If you do not take 'unpopular' steps now, you will be forced to implement them under worse terms after a few months.""*

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan has escalated the situation by abducting a Nagorno-Karabakh citizen who was traveling to Armenia for surgery. The man is accused of ""war crimes"". 

**BABAYAN:** As I've said earlier, Azerbaijan has a list of 300 individuals they want to arrest. When I suggested holding direct negotiations to discuss the establishment of mutual trust, that was one of the reasons, but some morons described it as a selfish attempt by me to save my own skin. They didn't take it seriously. 

Now they will gradually receive more ""surprises"" because of their inaction. I've submitted a 5-point document to the President, describing what needs to be discussed with Azerbaijan. That was one of the 5 points, the so-called ""amnesty"". My proposal was ignored. Now we have the first arrest.

**REPORTER:** What is the solution? Will they return him or imprison him for decades?

**BABAYAN:** The solution is to launch serious talks with Baku and discuss the issue of every captive/hostage in one large package. There needs to be an amnesty so we can close this subject.

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh government and opposition parties are saying Azerbaijan will use the direct talks as an opportunity to promote the ""integration"" of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians into Azerbaijan.

**BABAYAN:** I don't care what they are saying. What are *we* doing to resolve the situation? Want to fight? How, against what, and where? Show me your plan. You've got no plan. But as soon as someone presents a plan, you call him a ""traitor"". This is not a winning strategy.

**REPORTER:** Your critics in Nagorno-Karabakh call you a traitor for supporting the opening of Aghdam road.

**BABAYAN:** I've never mentioned the Aghdam road specifically. I said we must create a point of cooperation on the Askeran border so we can conduct regular trade. You *are* going to do this eventually. You claim not to want it but you *will* be forced to in 2-5 months. And when that happens, those who are against this idea today must be held accountable for subjecting the Nagorno-Karabakh population to hunger for months.

There is no other realistic option. The naysayers also don't have any solution, they have a slogan: ""We must fight now as we did during the 1991 blockade"". Listen, buddy, in 1991 we had kolkhoz, sovkhoz, lots of food reserves, and even aircraft flights delivering goods. That's how we survived in 1991. None of that exists today. Don't be delusional.

I presented my negotiation plan and invited public figures to discuss and improve it. In return, I got called a ""traitor"". Fine. I'll step aside then. You have the full freedom to act. Go *""fight until the end""* as much as you want. You will eventually understand that you have failed and you are on the brink of surrender like the ruling party ARF surrendered in August 1992. ARF surrendered and admitted they were incapable of ruling anymore. The emergency GKO committee was formed to create a new governing system. 

It's the same situation today. You have all sorts of people claiming to be the best candidate for negotiations with Azerbaijan. We have Ruben Vardanyan who said he came to Nagorno-Karabakh only recently, has never participated in prior wars, and would therefore be a great candidate for a negotiator, ""they will negotiate with me."" Fine, go negotiate. But Azerbaijan called him a Russian spy instead. 

Unable to negotiate, Vardanyan claims that if *he* can't negotiate then *no one else* should be *able to*. Vardanyan doesn't want any negotiations to take place. As an Armenian person, I demand an explanation from him. Vardanyan doesn't care about the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, he is there to inflate his personal image.

President Arayik and Sec.Con. Vitali Balasanyan spent 2 years and 9 months negotiating with Azerbaijan after the war. They discussed and resolved some issues. They even agreed to remove weapons from Nagorno-Karabakh, tanks, and other weapons. A schedule was developed to remove 56 tanks. I don't want to reveal everything. At least don't call others a traitor after having done all of that.

Do you really think there were no direct talks with Azerbaijan all these 2 years and 9 months? Russian [peacekeeping chief] acted as mediator. They met twice in Khojalu and several times before that. They addressed the [presumably joint use of a northern road in Nagorno-Karabakh] and issues relating to villages. Lots of topics that I won't disclose.

**REPORTER:** Did Arayik and Vitali agree to remove weapons during one of these talks?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. They agreed to remove 56 units of equipment within 2 months.

**REPORTER:** Was it removed?

**BABAYAN:** The first half of those 56 units were already removed. As far as I know, the second batch has not been removed.

**REPORTER:** You suggested using a border point in Askeran to conduct trade with Azerbaijan. The critics fear it can be used to promote the ""integration"" process. 

**BABAYAN:** We have a plan that touches upon 20 major topics that we must discuss with Azerbaijan. We must discuss that plan among ourselves, improve it, then send a negotiator, who will not be allowed to deviate from that plan. This is the first phase. It's humanitarian in nature, for trust-building.

If Azerbaijan displays a constructive stance and we see that they are serious about establishing trust, then we can proceed to the second phase, to discuss the political aspect of the conflict. Don't focus on whether Azerbaijan will demand their flag installed here or there, it's not time yet, we are yet to discuss confidence-building measures.

**REPORTER:** Isn't it obvious that we cannot build trustworthy relations with Azerbaijan? 

**BABAYAN:** No. It's possible. If we try and fail, if Azerbaijan refuses, only then we can confidently claim it's impossible. 

**REPORTER:** Will Azerbaijan agree to discuss those 20 topics?

**BABAYAN:** We'll send it to Baku in written form. They are free to amend and send it back. If there is a mutually acceptable part we can hold negotiations to resolve the pending issues. It is all about making civilians' lives easier. If they reject even this, then we go for another round of war.

**REPORTER:** What if Azerbaijan presents only one topic: integration?

**BABAYAN:** If you watch Azeri and international news, everyone was at first talking about ""integration"", but they have suddenly shifted the language to ""confidence-building"". 

Do you remember how Aliyev went from demanding a ""corridor"" to clarifying himself that he never actually meant a ""corridor""? Are you sure you understand the real definition of ""integration""? How do you know their definition of ""integration"" isn't something acceptable, like closer economic ties with Azerbaijan?

Azerbaijan will never listen to the world. They have their own strategy. You either fight or negotiate. Choose one. The world isn't going to rescue you. Go protest as much as you want. Nothing will happen.

If you want to fight, then at least do one of the following:

1) Gain the status of an international subject via UN's Chapter 7 so Azerbaijan can't treat you as an ""internal problem"".

2) As the legal successor of this region, as the actor who made you part of Azerbaijan during the USSR, Russia must answer for this situation and ensure physical safety.

3) Challenge Azerbaijan's claim over Nagorno-Karabakh by bringing up the legal violations in the UN. Nagorno-Karabakh was originally declared as a disputed territory by the Nations League and wasn't recognized as part of Azerbaijan. But the Nations League's successor UN, despite the presence of the same ethnic and other issues on the ground, recognized it as part of Azerbaijan, in violation of its own rules. Armenia must submit a letter to challenge the UN's decision and point out the fact that this violation has since led to 2 wars in the region.

So if you want to struggle for independence, at least do one of those three. Nothing will come out of your [President's] protests in Stepanakert. We tried that unsuccessfully in 1988. That strategy doesn't work.

**REPORTER:** Will Azerbaijan use force against Nagorno-Karabakh?

**BABAYAN:** At least not at this stage, but things change rapidly around the world. A lot depends on us. We can have a favorable outcome if we work.

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan won't even allow the food trucks to enter Nagorno-Karabakh. Is it even possible to live peacefully with them?

**BABAYAN:** Azerbaijan wants us to buy the food from Azerbaijan (not import it from another state) and send it to Nagorno-Karabakh via Aghdam road. So tell me, did you enjoy your 20-year-long belly rub and the squandering of public resources that made all this possible? 

**REPORTER:** [unintelligable]

**BABAYAN:** Ex-president Serj Sargsyan and others talk a lot these days. What have they done for 20 years? We lost the war because they hid the issues in the army. Serj and [newly elected] Pashinyan ignored my suggestions about weapons acquisitions. I told them to either 1) buy enough weapons specified by me, 2) seek a mandate for a major power to enter Nagorno-Karabakh, or 3) accept any concession proposed by the OSCE Minsk Group. They ignored all three.

We don't have a functional state today. Look at how things are handled in Nagorno-Karabakh. They catch a random guy from the street and appoint him as a minister. The guy doesn't admit that he lacks governing skills. He [State Minister Gurgen Nersisyan] is busy yelling at tomato sellers on the street for pricing their goods above the legal caps. The guy is the head of the government. He is protesting in front of the Red Cross office with 40 others. This is us now. Why are we criticizing others?

**REPORTER:** What is Nersisyan supposed to do?

**BABAYAN:** Govern the state. They were supposed to properly distribute fuel so villagers could deliver food to cities. They have more than enough fuel for all these cars in Stepanakert but not enough for farmers? It's a result of a lack of skills to manage resources.

**REPORTER:** Why did the president of the Nagorno-Karabakh Parliament resign?

**BABAYAN:** 1) He has health issues. 2) It's mostly a political decision. They have decided to replace him with someone from ARF, to grant ARF more powers. It's a terrible idea. They are going to further destabilize the situation with that move. Besides that, ARF only has 3 MPs, we have 9, and the other has 16. What's the point of ARF agreeing to hold this position? The decision was made by an agreement between the new and old leaders [of Nagorno-Karabakh]. Apparently, they want to play with the population a little bit more. Okay, go on and play.

**REPORTER:** Do you mean ex-president Bako Sahakyan and others are working together?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. They have one goal: humiliate our population as much as possible, as long as they get to keep their lives. 

**REPORTER:** Is the Armenian government doing enough to help Nagorno-Karabakh?

**BABAYAN:** The governments of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh appear to have a strategy. I'm not familiar with the details and the steps that are being taken, but the government of Nagorno-Karabakh doesn't complain about the Armenian government that much. I'm not familiar with the content of their discussions.

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan says he doesn't have a mandate to decide Nagorno-Karabakh's fate. Is that problematic?

**BABAYAN:** Of course not. Big brother Armenia to little brother Nagorno-Karabakh should be like Turkey to Azerbaijan. The problem is, the little brother [Nagorno-Karabakh government] is hesitating to act. This is where the problem is. We must correct the mistake that began in 1999 [when Nagorno-Karabakh was removed from the negotiation table]. 

We must sit down and discuss our issues with Azerbaijan. It doesn't matter if we lost the war. We have been elevated from an object to a subject. If we negotiate skillfully, things will work out.

##interview with a military industry expert Gor Amatuni

**REPORTER:** Have you witnessed any progress in the development of Armenia's domestic military industry after the war?

**AMATUNI:** Yes, many positive changes. It's no longer the ""hell"" that it used to be. Big improvements at the Military Industry Committee, and smaller improvements in the Defense Ministry in terms of ease of working with them.

**REPORTER:** Describe some of the changes.

**AMATUNI:** Inventors and scientists are being heard and invited for meetings. ""We were finally able to reach someone knowledgable,"" they say. There is a systemic approach now. Before, the manufacturers were producing whatever they wanted or could. Now, the system describes the manufacturers how their product will be implemented and in conjunction with what other products.

**REPORTER:** You said the military industry still has issues with the Defense Ministry. Describe it.

**AMATUNI:** Mainly bureaucracy. Certain individuals within the Ministry, not the entire ministry, are corrupt. They hinder the process. There are times when we present our product that's better and cheaper than what they import, but they refuse to accept ours because it's easier for them [to skim by forging the import records]. 

**REPORTER:** What limitations does our domestic industry have?

**AMATUNI:** A small country like Armenia cannot produce weapons on its own, we need to partner with international players, and we do. Our military industry must produce AND import. We have partnerships with several states: India, Greece, Cyprus, France, etc.

**REPORTER:** Indian press was excited that a foreign state [Armenia] has finally signed a large-scale weapons contract. But do we have a problem with delivering those weapons to Armenia?

**AMATUNI:** The deliveries are successful despite some difficulties. Items that cannot be delivered in one piece are being delivered piece by piece. Do know that we are importing weapons not just from India.

**REPORTER:** From where else?

**AMATUNI:** Several states, including a NATO state. Let's not open the parenthesis for now.

**REPORTER:** Is Armenia's membership in CSTO not an issue for the NATO state?

**AMATUNI:** There are NATO countries that want to help strengthen Armenia. There are always ways to import technologies, visible or invisible. The NATO country in question is France. Not everything is ideal yet but things are moving forward now. [Last month we learned that Defense Minister Papikyan visited France to discuss military cooperation. Pashinyan later described his visit as ""successful"" but didn't reveal details]. 

**REPORTER:** Are these steps helping restore the military balance in the region?

**AMATUNI:** Our #1 opponent in the region is Turkey. Obviously we are not as powerful as them but the goal is to be able to make war too costly for your opponent by being able to conduct strikes critical for them. We are working towards that.

**REPORTER:** But isn't our #1 opponent Azerbaijan?

**AMATUNI:** Azerbaijan is nothing without Turkey. We would have torn them into pieces if it wasn't for all the assistance from Turkey. I don't make such claims without evidence. In reality, several states are working against us, including Russia today. So we must develop our domestic military industry to turn Armenia into a hedgehog. Touch me and you'll be stung.

**REPORTER:** What else can you tell us about the cooperation with France?

**AMATUNI:** When people hear ""weapons"" they often only think of a gun that shoots at you. But there is a lot more than that. France is the strongest state in the EU. Today, steps are being taken to ""cooperate"" with them, it's not just about receiving aid. There are serious efforts to cooperate with France, Greece, Cyprus, etc.

**REPORTER:** Any efforts to train our soldiers in France?

**AMATUNI:** France could send a few experts to Armenia, we don't need to send our soldiers there. Modern training is conducted with digital joysticks, not Soviet-style spetsnaz training. One guy with a joystick could kill a battalion's worth of enemy troops. There is some progress in this area, too.

5/25/2021,AITA for causing my twin sister to postpone her wedding with her fiancee?,"throwaway since my nieces from my older sibling use Reddit and I don't want them to find my account, also I'm from Azerbaijan so my English is not the best.

&#x200B;

So for context, I(21M) have a twin sister(21F) who I basically grew up with. We are incredibly close and I truly only want for her to be happy, but I'm afraid I might have gotten in the way of her happiness.

For a little backstory, I am a very petite dude. 5'6 and very bony. I've kinda been insecure about my build my whole life but nothing serious. My sister was engaged to this buff dude(26M) very built and around 6'4. He treats me fine whenever my sister is but when she is not he makes rude comments about my height and weight, my mannerisms, posture, etc.

&#x200B;

I kinda shut up about it and sucked it up cause I didn't want my sister to be upset but recently something happened and it was the last straw for me. He was having a huge bachelor party and for whatever reason decided to invite me. I showed up there and he and his 3 or so friends constantly laughed at me and pointed at me and some other ppl for the majority of the party. So when I decide to leave, I go up to him to congratulate him like a mature person, only for him to say ""don't worry little guy, once you get out of puberty you'll find someone""

I told him to go f\*ck himself and that I already was seeing a very nice person and it's none of his business. Later that night while preparing food with my sister I told her about this and every other time he has been doing things like mocking me or body blocking me and she got furious. She called her fiancee screaming and that she'll need to take some time before the wedding to rethink the relationship before the wedding. now she is crying and I feel like I ruined her chance at love.

So AITA for ratting my sister's fiancee to her and making her very upset?

edit: i didn't say something earlier cause i felt like i could endure it to not worry my sister"

This is actually one of if not the most the most complex political and legal situations right now, and I don’t see many people explaining it outside of a few intensely biased comments on both sides. For those of you who know the comments I usually make, this one will not source quotes like I usually do, instead these comments will proceed in parts with a separate source comment at the bottom. I do not anticipate many people will read due to length, but the analysis is here nonetheless.

TL;DR the international community and international law have in many ways let the people of Nagorno-Karabakh (the territory this conflict is primarily being fought over) down over the past 100 years, and the eventual results may affect the future of international relations and law.

 

**PART I:**

 

**(a) the legal history**

 

The non-partisan gist of the whole situation, along with a brief legal analysis is this:

In 1918, the First Republic of Armenia, Georgia, and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic sprang into being. These new states were promptly crushed by the Ottoman Empire which had, since 1914, been conducting a violent campaign against the Armenian people which has now been formally recognized as genocide by 29 countries including Canada, the United States and nearly the entirety of Europe. In their defeat, Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan were forced to sign the Treaty of Batum where they ceded most of their territory back to the Ottoman Empire. Then the Ottoman Empire was itself crushed at the end of the first world war by the allies.

After World War I, the Ottoman Empire was forced to sign the Treaty of Sevres[1]. That treaty divided the Ottoman Empire between the victorious powers and forced the Ottoman Empire to recognize Armenia as a free and independent state before signing over the Oblast of Karabakh to British rule. This was opposed by both the Azerbaijani peoples living in Karabakh and the Armenian peoples living in Karabakh. As a consequence, the Karabakh National Assembly provisionally voted to exist under Azerbaijani administration which was accepted by the British. The Armenians did not accept the result, feeling that the council did not represent them. This led to a military conflict over Karabakh.

During that fighting, the Bolsheviks (very basically, members of a multi-national political movement that started in Russia and served as a precursor to the Soviet Union) took over government in Azerbaijan. The Armenians made a temporary agreement with those Bolsheviks on August 10, 1920 to allow the Bolsheviks to temporarily occupy Karabakh. Soon after that time, the Armenian government was also taken over by the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks originally promised to give Karabakh to Armenia, however in 1921, Russia was also attempting to placate the newly formed state of Turkey which still hated the Armenian people.

Therefore, within the Treaty of Moscow[2], the signatories, which included the Bolshevik-controlled countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russian declared the new Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast to be an autonomously governed Oblast under the protection of Azerbaijan, and thus part of Azerbaijani territory. This was reaffirmed in the Treaty of Kars[3] where the now Soviet Socialist Republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia and Soviet Russia would sign another agreement recommitting to the same. That treaty was technically in force as of 1923 as between Turkey and the rest of the countries as that was the legal year of Turkey’s birth as a country.

We’re not done here, and Armenia’s argument is coming, but it’s important to pause and enter the world of international law. Under international law, a country may only acquire territory in three ways. Effective occupation of terra nullius (land that absolutely no one lives on) [4], prescription (sort of akin to squatter’s rights)[5], or the people within the country are so oppressed as to be titled to a right of external self-determination [6]. We will come back to the latter idea in more depth later.

In order to assess whether the land was properly transferred, we have to trace the land transfer. The Ottoman Empire transferred the land to Britain which did as Britain often did at the time and allowed the peoples to determine for themselves who they wanted to be ruled by so long as it wasn’t themselves, which ended up being Azerbaijan, thus that transfer was properly and legally affected. Regardless, both Azerbaijan and Armenia agreed twice both with each other and with Turkey and Russia that the land should be given to Azerbaijan. Transferring land the way that is was done by the Bolsheviks is legal. Regardless of the fact that in reality they represented a governing structure that spanned outside of the government they were controlling, the fact is that under international law, they had the power to control the government of those states, and thus under international law, those states willingly agreed to land boundaries. Now, regardless of this legal fact I know that I’ve probably made a lot of people angry, but bear with me for a couple more paragraphs.

Continuing on with the history, this arrangement in the Soviet Union placated the countries for over 50 years. However, during that time, the population of Nagorno-Karabakh became decidedly more Armenian. By the late 1980s, over 75% of the Nagorno-Karabakh population was Armenian[7]. In 1988, the Autonomous Government of Nagorno-Karabakh requested Moscow approve a land transfer of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijani Rule to Armenian rule. This request was denied, which led to mass demonstrations and violence that escalated into war throughout Nagorno-Karabakh. In response the Soviet Union ended its mandate over Nagorno-Karabakh and transferred direct control to Azerbaijan. This backfired when the Armenian Supreme Soviet (basically their governing legislature) and the Autonomous Government of Nagorno-Karabakh demanded that they be unified, further escalating the conflict.

Here comes Armenia’s argument. While legally, as per international law, Azerbaijan had and still maintains the ability to refuse this request due to Nagorno-Karabakh being part of its territory, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh have a right to what is called self-determination. The right of self-determination is enshrined in the first Article of the UN Charter and essentially means that all peoples individually have the right to at least have a say in the way they are governed[8]. This has led to two concepts within the international legal academic community, internal self-determination and external self-determination.

 

**(b) The law of self-determination as applied to the issue**

 

Internal self-determination refers to one’s ability to determine their political, social and economic development within the state[9]. External self-determination occurs when a group of people is unable to assert internal self-determination. In that case there are three options. They may take the land they live on and become a country of their own, they may become a part of another state, or they may freely associate with another state[10]. But what steps do we go through determine whether the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh have a right of self determination?

Legally this is a bit of a conundrum because while the global community did a good job protecting self-determination, it did a bad job defining it. Now this is likely by design for many reasons outside the scope of this conversation that I would be happy to answer later if anyone asks. To find the test for self-determination, of all places we have to turn to Canada. In 1998, the Government of Quebec, a province of Canada, sought a referendum to separate from Canada and become its own country. Naturally, the federal government of Canada had to determine whether the referendum created legal obligations under either domestic or international law (yes Canadian courts, like most other courts including the United States directly consider international law in their rulings). It remains the only major decision outside of the recent Spanish Catalonia decision which for less straightforward reasons decided along the same lines.

The test devised by the Canadian courts for external self-determination was developed in joint with several other experts in international law from around the world, and the decision was not based only within Canadian law. The test is as such[11]:

The peoples who seek external self-determination must be an oppressed peoples which means: a. They are a “peoples” which have a tie to the land that they are seeking external self-determination (this is intentionally vague) b. The peoples must not have a say over they own governance (i.e. they do not have the ability to vote or their vote has no impact on their governance)
The peoples must freely express their will to externally self-determine[12]
Notably, the biggest barrier to the test is the idea that being able to vote on your government makes you unable to assert external self-determination. The second largest barrier is the actual expression of self-determination. The major issue on the second barrier is that the world has not actually defined how that occurs. In the ICJ Advisory Opinion on Western Saharan Africa, it was done through referendum, but there has never been a determination that the government of a territory, duly elected by the people of the territory, is unable to assert the same. So, it may be perfectly possible to do so. The larger issue is whether the Armenian people on Nagorno-Karabakh are so entitled in the first place based on 1 (a) and (b).

The Armenian people on Nagorno-Karabakh are no doubt a “peoples” for the purpose of 1(a), hence why they are called the Armenian people in the first place. They also undoubtedly have a long historic tie to the land which may be examined through centuries of history, so 1(a) is undoubtedly satisfied."

9/20/2022,"The people of Azerbaijan, what do you think about the news of Azerbaijani soldiers torturing Armenian soldiers/civilians?","This is not a rhetorical question. I'm neither from Azerbaijan nor Armenia. I am simply curious about how Azerbaijani people react when they hear about the news of Azerbaijani soldiers torturing Armenian soldiers and civilians in captivity. I have read many stories, verified by sources such as Amnesty International, about Azerbaijani soldiers beating Armenians, stripping them of their clothes, decapitating them, and many forms of torture, so disturbing that I'd rather avoid describing them. I can just say the atrocities I've read about are on the same level as the atrocities committed by ISIS and Mexican cartels. Unfortunately, these are not some rumors. I have seen videos of them and ... I know no language that can express my disgust and anger. My feelings are not directed towards the people of a country, but towards the people involved in these videos.

The name of the website that shares these videos is azeriwarcrimes. It's domain is org. I am not putting a proper link here just to make sure you don't just click on it as it contains highly graphic and disturbing videos and if you don't want to see people being tortured and limbs being mutilated, please do not check this website at all.

Now, I'm not here to convince or to be convinced. I am here to know about ""your"" attitude towards this issue. So, if you are an individual from Azerbaijan, I would like to know:

1- Regardless of whether the victims were soldiers or civilians, and whether the atrocities were committed in retaliation or not, do you believe Azerbaijani soldiers have committed such atrocities or not? If yes, do you support such inhumane acts or are you against them? If you don't believe Azerbaijani soldiers have done so, what makes you believe the reports and the videos are not true?

Also, two factual questions:

2- Regardless of whether you believe these reports and videos are real or not, has any individual or any political/non-political group in Azerbaijan ever protested against such acts?

3- Can Azerbaijani people freely protest against such atrocities without the fear of being labeled as a spy or the enemy of the state?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance. Again, this question is not an attack towards Azerbaijani people. I know Azerbaijan has lovely people with a culture to be proud of. I am simply curious about your attitude towards a phenomenon."

##more jihadist videos arrive

[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/j4mbdw/oct32020_wrapup_war_in_karabakhartsakh_the_most), we saw a video recorded by a Syrian mercenary *(who mentioned the word Armenia)* inside an Armenian armory that they captured. The same armory was also filmed by the Azerbaijani army and uploaded on the internet, thus confirming that they have jihadists.

**00:45 Artsakh president:** I'm still in the front while handling politics remotely. After heavy battles, we improved our positions and built a ground for future successes. After failing in the front line, Azeris resumed bombing the civilians. This war crime will not go unpunished. We will win and punish those who threaten our existence.

**12:03 army:** we destroyed 2 tanks and 3 aircraft in the south.

https://factor.am/290694.html

**12:56 military expert:** the destruction of Ganja airport was important. It's only 61km away. Turkish jets fly from there within seconds. A few of them are probably destroyed. They would need to use another airport, further away from the front, which could give Armenians time to analyze and learn the enemy plans. Turkey coordinates it's jet attacks from headquarters in Kars, Turkey. 

https://orakarg.com/41558

**13:26 Artsakh president:** if the Azeri govt doesn't learn from this, we will continue to strike and dismantle the enemy's rear and the army. I've asked the army to stop the fire for now to prevent casualties among the Azeri civilian population.

https://factor.am/290706.html

**19:44 Pashinyan to German Bild outlet:** this isn't just a local security issue. 

First, Turkey imported jihadists from Syria. 

Second, Turkish soldiers are directly involved. It's part of their ""Turkish empire"" ambitions which we also see in Libya and the Middle East. 

Third, Turkey is back for another genocide. Their goal is to absorb Azerbaijan and ends its independence. 

Fourth, if Europe doesn't assess the situation accurately, they should expect Turkey at the gates of Vienna.

**21:10 army:** Today alone, Azeris left 400 dead, 700 wounded, 13 armored vehicles, 3 aircraft, 1 UAV. Our losses will be announced when we properly identify and verify.

Lots of misleading information was shared by Ilham Aliyev. We saw how they congratulated themselves with capturing Mataghis. Today we published videos showing how Azeri soldiers were running away from Magathis under our artillery fire.

Today they spread another misinformation about Jabrayil capture.

Aliyev is under an information blockade. He is not being briefed properly. He is being fed false information, which he tries to use to sell a big victory to his people.

Our airstrike on Ganja airport shows how little Aliyev cares about the Azeri population. Not one step was taken by him to organize a civil defense program since the beginning of the war. All while the Azeri army knew that them attacking our cities would result in our counter-strike on their military base in Ganja.

Today's battled weren't as fierce and Azeris failed to conduct anything significant because the Turkish aid was somewhat neutralized thanks to our air defense and other measures. Turkish UAVs were unable to work, hence the insignificant gains, heavy losses, more retreat.

Our soldiers have incredibly high morale, especially the conscripts and their commanders. We have heroes. One artilleryman received a wound but kept shelling the opponent's positions until the last bomb, before seeking treatment.

**22:30 interview to France24:** Pashinyan has informed the U.S. about having radar evidence that Turkish F-16 jets were striking Armenian positions. ""It shows how they strolled the Republic of Armenia border on September 27 and 28 and then bombed the villages near Vardenis. ""The question is, did the United State build these jets so Turkey can use them to bomb innocent civilians?""

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1030346.html 

**22:24 Pashinyan to France24 TV:** Azerbaijani public is a victim of a dictatorial regime. Armenians are a ""convenient enemy"" that Aliyev uses to divert attention from lack of freedom of speech, democracy, human rights, and socio-economic hardships. Social media is severely limited in Azerbaijan. The same family has ruled Azerbaijan since 1994. Meanwhile, Karabakh has changed 4 presidents.

**22:55:** Artsakh govt denies the Azeri allegations about striking Mingechaur city. *(Mingechaurhas an electric plant that generates 35% of the country's electricity. There is also a huge water dam nearby).* 

Azeri social media reports allegedly intercepting two Armenian rockets in the air.

**Washington Post Op:** Erdogan’s reckless intervention is fueling fighting in Azerbaijan and Armenia. Trump should tell Erdogan to stand down.

Azerbaijan’s autocratic ruler, Ilham Aliyev, has launched an offensive to regain the territories his country lost in the 1990s. He is doing so with the direct support of Turkey.

Turkey was once a reliable NATO ally. But in the past several years Mr. Erdogan has increasingly sought to make his nation into a geopolitical power

It’s not clear how far Russia will go to stop the Turkish-Azeri offensive; Mr. Pashinyan was democratically elected in 2018 after a popular uprising, and so is no favorite of Vladimir Putin. But it is in the U.S. interest to stop the fighting and restart negotiations.

##Syrian jihadists recruited by Azerbaijan upload more videos, further proving their presence 

In case you're a new reader, check out the links above for previous stories. Turkey has helped Azerbaijan to recruit Syrian jihadists, some of whom are ISIS commanders.

&nbsp;

PM Pashinyan shared the video in which Syrian jihadists are seen using Azeri vehicles and uniforms while shooting towards Armenian positions.

""The Armenians of the world must put this outrageous fact before the world and focus on the following agenda. Condemnation of the terrorist attack on Artsakh and recognition of Artsakh's independence""

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1031206.html

&nbsp;

Armenian MoD shared the analysis of one of the videos showing the Syrian jihadists using Azeri equipment in Artsakh battles.

https://twitter.com/ShStepanyan/status/1315241445310304258?s=20

&nbsp;

Syrian jihadists *(possibly Turkmen from northern Syria?)* uploaded a video from one of the areas they occupied in the first week, along the southern borders with Iran, south of Jabrayil.

The video shows a sign in the Armenian language that reads ""Attention, border line. Entry only with a passport.""

One of the jihadists, while speaking in Arabic, is seen showing the hand-sign of a Turkish terrorist organization 'Grey Wolves'.

##October 11th arrives / battles and international response 
 
**00:30**: Armenia denied shelling Azeri city Terter, and criticized Azerbaijan for shelling Armenian Shushi and Stepanakert, despite the ceasefire agreement. One Armenian civilian died in Martuni.

Azerbaijan used bombs filled with shrapnel against the civilian population.

**00:51:** Azeri social media circulated fake news claiming Georgian border patrol stopped Armenian trucks loaded with Russian weapons. The Georgian Finance Ministry officially denied it, saying the trucks were allowed to proceed. The photo shows the real content of the trucks:

**7:48:** WarGonzo reports that Azerbaijan violated the ceasefire all night by dropping the banned cluster bombs on the capital Stepanakert. One civilian building was completely destroyed.
 
Photos: https://factor.am/293980.html , https://t.me/wargonzo/3727

**9:04 U.S. Representative TJ Cox:** The United States must stand up against terrorism and act now. Azerbaijan's complete lack of respect for the ceasefire is one of the reasons why the United States should suspend military assistance to Azerbaijan, punish Azeri officials for the losses of hundreds of human lives, and review our diplomatic relations with Turkey. For two weeks now, they've been violating human rights and continuing the violence against Armenians. 

https://factor.am/293995.html
 
 
 
 **10:37 Artsakh president Arayik's press conference:** Azerbaijan is not respecting the ceasefire agreement reached in Moscow. 

Azerbaijan has brought international terrorism to the region. The facts are overwhelming and have been verified by the international community.

Azeris use Smerch, Polonez, and suicide drones against Armenian civilians and civilian infrastructure in the capital Stepanakert and elsewhere. The church in Shushi has no military object, yet it was bombed several times. Azerbaijan's goal is ethnic cleansing. 

Artsakh will not be part of Azerbaijan. 

I've lived many proud moments by meeting courageous soldiers in front, but I'm also proud of everyone for providing aid to Artsakh refugee families, collecting financial aid, and your calls for the world to recognize the Artsakh Republic.

We're in constant communication with the govt of Armenia. They provide us all the necessary humanitarian aid. We keep them informed about the situation in front lines. 

If the Azeri-terrorist coalition doesn't display signs of willingness to resolve the conflict peacefully in the next few days, I'll ask the Armenian government, and the rest of the world, to officially recognize the Artsakh Republic. We will see which countries respect human rights and which ones support terrorism.

I bow to the courageous soldiers in front lines. There are hundreds or thousands of examples of heroic actions; we will talk about them later. ""Ձեր բոլորի ցավը տանեմ։""

About Hadrut. Since Aliyev had earlier claimed he had captured Hadrut, yet just hours before the ceasefire he realized his troops were far away from Hadrut, they chose their last attack to be on Hadrut. They formed an infiltration group, possibly also consisted of special forces of a foreign state. They infiltrated the city but we pushed them back. Today, Hadrut's mayor is in the city hall. I just spoke with him minutes earlier. You draw conclusions.

The government of Israel is also responsible for Azerbaijan's ethnic cleansings because they intentionally continue to supply them with suicide drones, even though the drones were meant for Azerbaijan's self-defense. Israeli govt preferred money over God's values.

**16:23:** Russian and Turkish MFAs spoke on the phone about the importance of respecting the ceasefire.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1031250.html

**14:06 army spokesman:** After the victory, I will personally introduce you to those five anti-tank girls. And in general, our female heroines are a subject of another pride. It is a pity that we can not openly show their faces at the moment, especially the one who left her six-month-old child under the care of her mother and went to war.

**18:36 ex-president Levon Ter-Petrosyan:**  It's shocking how the government of a nation [Israel] that was a victim of a terrible genocide, motivated by purely financial interests, could actively support the open genocide against another nation. 

The statement of 15 Israeli intellectuals [against weapon supplies] gives us hope that the Israeli society will stand up and force its own government to apologize to the Armenian people and to renounce its shameful and inhumane position.

**17:42 Russian MP and CIS Institute director Zatulin:** these clashes are much heavier because Turkey is involved, and they make decisions for Azerbaijan; sometimes Turkey answers to calls before Azerbaijan does.

There is evidence that Azeris mutilate deceased bodies, which is banned by international law.

Azerbaijan used illegal weapons and cluster bombs against Armenian civilians. The unexploded ones can cause damage years later.  

5800 buildings, 960 infrastructure objects, and 520 cars are seriously damaged in Artsakh.

##July 16th / Large invasion with 100 soldiers fails / Azeris sustain heavy casualties (10+ dead) / Bodies extracted
 
After a relatively calm day, the battles resumed on July 16th.
 
**Army**: At 3:40 am Armenian guards noticed a movement. They repelled an infiltration attempt. Azeris sustained multiple casualties and were forced to retreat. No deaths on the Armenia side.
 
Defense Minister Tonoyan called OSCE to inform about the high number of Azeri casualties.

https://factor.am/269322.html , https://factor.am/269319.html , https://factor.am/269331.html
 
&nbsp;
 
**Army**: We'll let Azerbaijan extract the dead bodies if they stop shelling.

The two sides agreed. Azeris safely walked into the buffer zone to collect the dead bodies from the field.

**Pashinyan & Army**: this morning Azeris used 100 soldiers to try to take ""Anvakh"" military outpost between Movses-Aygepar villages. This wasn't a diversionary attack. It was a classic military attack with lots of resources. Azeris used their highly trained ""Yashma"" special forces, as confirmed by Azerbaijan.

We don't have deaths or injuries from this attack. They have at least 10 deaths. We have multiple video recordings from multiple fields that show even more casualties.
 
We don't know what their strategy was. What they did ""isn't in the books"". You draw a conclusion.

Azeri suicide drone wounded an Armenian civilian in Chinari village. He sustained 10% body burns and shrapnel wounds. He's in stable-serious condition.
 
When the Emergency Ministry vehicle came to rescue him, another suicide drone hit the emergency truck. No injuries. The emergency truck was properly color-coded to indicate it's civilian, but the Azeri army targeted it regardless.
 
Armenian army issued a warning, ""If Azerbaijan continues to use drones including against civilians, the number of Azeri casualties, in addition to this morning's deaths, could sharply rise.""

##Azerbaijan threatens to bomb Metsamor nuclear power plant
 
Azeri Defense Ministry official ""reminded"" Armenians that they have rockets that can reach the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant, ""which will cause widespread damage in Armenia"".
 
**Armenpress**: Armenia hasn't officially threatened to bomb Azeri civilian objects in a similar fashion, including Azerbaijan's Mengichavur water dum [destruction of which would leave the quarter of Azerbaijan underwater.]
 
**Army**: the Azeri official who threatened to bomb the nuclear plant should undergo a psychiatric evaluation.
 
https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/192804 , https://youtu.be/c9x5_zzjPDU
 
&nbsp;
 
Reuters, RIA News, Interfax, and other outlets wrote articles mentioning nuclear threats. https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1022053.html
 
&nbsp;
 
**MP Rubinyan**: ""by threatening to bomb the nuclear plant, Azerbaijan is once again exposing its inhumane, backward, and terrorist agenda."" 
https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/192817
 
&nbsp;
 
**Justice Minister Badasyan:** this should be worrying for the entire region as well as the international community. https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/192821
 
&nbsp;
 
**Parliament official**: Azerbaijan threatened to violate the Geneva convention, which prohibits the targeting of buildings that contain dangerous materials, including nuclear plants. We'll make sure the international community is made aware.
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1022022.html
 
&nbsp;
 
**ex-MP Ashotyan**: the threats came from an Azeri public official. The regime isn't hiding its terroristic and fascist nature.
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1022033.html
 

 
 
 
##Ilham Aliyev's meltdown / Gets mad at ambassadors
 
Yesterday Aliyev fired the Foreign Minister Mammedyarov. Today he blasted ambassadors to several countries and accused them of working for those countries' interests and being recruited by those countries' security forces.
 
&nbsp;

**Aliyev**: we warned the foreign intelligence (of our friendly countries) that we know that they're bribing our ambassadors, that they gave them houses. These officials ignored the best interest of Azerbaijan and Azeri public. 

It shows the nature of fake friendship with these countries. They try to weaken us and spread false information about Azerbaijan's government.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1022052.html
 
 
 
 
##Ilham Aliyev angry that few Azeris are willing to go to war
 
**Ilham Aliyev**: those protesting citizens who were chanting ""I want to fight in Karabagh"" should go and sign up at the draft agency. I asked the draft chief and he said only 150 have signed up since the beginning of the clashes.
 
&nbsp;

Draw a conclusion. How many people were protesting yesterday in Shahid's Park? Thousands…. yet only 150 signed up. I asked where the most applications came from and he said Tovuz region (the hotspot) with 60 applicants.
 
&nbsp;

I repeat, we don't need a full draft right now. We know how many people we need to solve a problem. But no one should turn themselves into a street hero.
 
*Context: Aliyev is mad that nationalist protesters called for govt members' resignation for poor handling on Tavush Battles.*

##Armenian veterans & volunteers are mobilizing
 
War veteran MP Rustam Gasparyan gathered a meeting with his ""Black Leopard"" veteran group and began collecting volunteers. They're waiting for Defense Ministry's call.
https://news.am/arm/news/591547.html
 
&nbsp;
 
**Sasna Tsrer's Jirayr Sefilian**: Historically, Tavush positions have been favorable to Azeris. Azerbaijan made a mistake. They began shelling civilians with 122mm shells. Now we have an opportunity and legal right to change the borders. We need to use this opportunity.
https://youtu.be/Lm1EH-NFXrk
 
&nbsp;
 
**Yezidi MP Rustam Bakoyan**: Dozens of Yezidi-Armenians have come forward to draft. I call for the Yezidi diaspora abroad to help the Armenian lobby to stop Aliyev's actions.
https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/192746
 
&nbsp;
 
**Defense Ministry**: thanks, but we don't need volunteers right now. Our soldiers are handling it properly. https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/192764
 
 
 
 

##Fake news during battles / Imaginary drone & accounts
 
 
**Army:** Azeris spread fake news about allegedly downing Armenian X-55 drone. The image they attached to the report is also fake. We don't even have X-55 in our arsenal. (update: Army said they don't have the type of X-55 shown in the image)

##Armenia scores diplomatic victory / Pro-Azeri European rapporteur resigns
 
Armenia is building the 3rd civilian highway to connect to Artsakh. Three rapporteurs of the European Parliament wrote a report about it, and condemned Armenia's plans while stating ""Armenia should have gotten Azerbaijan's permission first"".
 
&nbsp;

Armenian govt complained about the biased report ""which goes against OSCE format"", and pointed out that the chief rapporteur ~~Trayan Bacecku~~ Traian Băsescu has an anti-Armenian history in his home country. Today Băsescu resigned from his role as a regional rapporteur.
 
The second rapporteur has accepted Armenia's complaints and said they'll take it into account.

##Armenia lowers poverty line / Free medication for more people
 
Poverty is calculated by points, depending on various factors.
 
Today the govt lowered the point-threshold, allowing 27,000 additional residents to get meds completely for free. Around 227,000 people qualify.
 
Medications include several drugs for cancer, tuberculosis, mental health, diabetes, stroke, etc.
 
https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/192798
 
 

 
##Institutional reforms to fight corruption
 
Earlier the govt created a new anti-corruption institute tasked with vetting public officials to check if they have ""shady"" history, unreported wealth, etc.
 
Today the govt authorized the institute to audit the person within 2 years after they leave the public office, if there is evidence that they have an abnormal amount of wealth.
 
Officials must disclose certain types of financial transactions over $2,000.
 
Officials must disclose their properties valued over $8,000, instead of current $17,000.
 
""We'll have the most advanced wealth declaration system in the world,"" noted Justice Minister Badasyan. The bill needs Parliamentary approval.

##""This isn't out war"" / Talysh minorities complain about Azerbaijan's discriminatory draft & hate speech

[A few days ago we learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/j42mlr/oct22020_wrapup_war_in_karabakh_azerbaijan/?) how the government of Azerbaijan intentionally drafts disproportionately higher numbers of ethnic minorities. A new report came from Talysh activists. 

**The letter reads:** There is no military solution to this conflict, as it will only lead to problems for future generations. We are extremely concerned about the steps taken by the Azerbaijani authorities to send the Talysh to the battlefield.

We condemn the government's efforts to sow hatred in our community towards Armenians. Most Talysh people are dissatisfied with this situation. 

On the one hand, the government of Azerbaijan suppresses freedom of speech. On the other hand, it is exploited by those with close ties to the government to present as if there is hatred of Armenians among the Talysh.

We call on the Azerbaijani government to finally end its policy of sowing hatred. We urge the Talysh not to engage in hate speech. We urge them to refrain from participating in clashes. We have never been an opponent of any people in our history; we will continue this path.

##Azerbaijan's use of illegal cluster bomb on civilians

**The Telegraph:** ""Azerbaijan dropping cluster bombs on civilian areas in war with Armenia."" The Daily Telegraph saw evidence of the banned munitions' use in the capital of Karabakh.

The munitions, which scatter tiny bomblets over a wide area, are banned under a global treaty because of the risk they pose to civilians, especially children.

On a downtown street full of shops and housing blocks, large quantities of the bomblets - small cylindrical tubes about the size of a film can - were left scattered on the concrete. Several had failed to explode, posing an ongoing risk to passers-by.

More: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/05/azerbaijan-dropping-cluster-bombs-civilian-areas-war-armenia/

&nbsp;

Russian journalists run for cover and record the moment the rocket hits the ground capital Stepanakert (1:39 mark).

""There are no military objects here. It's downtown. Only civilian shops and districts. A mine's tail was left on a balcony. Lots of damage.""

##the 1,500 Syrian jihadists

**Foreign Policy writes:** Turkey has sent ~1,500 Syrian mercenaries to Azerbaijan after 5-60 day training, according to our source. They went from Syria to Gaziantep, Turkey on September 25th. 

They were offered $1,500/mo to sign a 4-month contract. Now, many regret signing it after learning about the death of 55 mercenaries. *(learn to code then)*. They were mislead about being sent to guard facilities.

""There is no communication between us and the Azerbaijani forces,"" one of the militants based in the Barda region of Azerbaijan told Foreign Policy. ""All militants are dissatisfied with the situation in Azerbaijan. The psychological atmosphere is very difficult.""

The arrival of 55 corpses near Aleppo village was tragic. They hadn't seen anything like that before. Turkey will pay $7,800 to the families of the deceased.

WarGonzo military journalists have learned that Azerbaijan plans to import 1,000 additional mercenaries from Pakistan/Afghanistan. The source claims it's due to the Azeri army's inability to complete the task when it comes to face-to-face fight. ""Aliyev has also failed to keep the promisee he gave to Erdogan about finishing it with blitzkriegg.""

##the fight against terrorism

Artsakh government plans to creature a coalition to fight terrorism. The Artsakh Parliament has contacted Iran to create a joint task-force ""to locate and destroy the terrorists"". 

""Terrorists fight against our homeland already disguised under the flag of a UN member state Azerbaijan, in the regular army of Azerbaijan. Everyone saw and recorded the entry of the global jihadist network into Azerbaijan. This terrorist cell is being fed by Turkey. 

As the president of a state fighting for its independence, I call on the civilized world to take an active part in this struggle. Creating an effective and efficient global anti-terrorist coalition is imperative today. I am sure the victory will be ours,"" said Artsakh president Arayik Harutyunyan.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1030620.html , https://news.am/arm/news/606431.html

**Sometime before or after:** President of Iran Rouhani spoke with Ilham Aliyev and informed him that Iran is concerned with the involvement of ""third countries"" in this conflict and the disability in its northern borders which could open the doors for terrorists.

##a few more things from yesterday

**Artsakh President Arayik:** yet another day with a stable success in the front. The army has accomplished the task brilliantly and is currently successfully defending in the air and land while inflicting heavy losses on them. 

This was the reason why the Azeri army fired over 100 Smerch missiles on the capital Stepanakert. 

I was also informed that the diaspora has already donated $50m. Thank you. We will restore the ruins after our victory. This unity of ours is proof that Azerbaijan has already lost.

**Rapper The Game** also published an Instagram video in support of Armenia. ""Share your voice. End global terrorism."" Another rapper Xzibit shared a similar post yesterday.

Context:

(From r/europe : https://reddit.com/r/europe/s/gRagzM5nEd )

>The Blockade of Artsakh is an ongoing event in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The region is disputed between Azerbaijan and the breakaway Republic of Artsakh, which has an indigenous Armenian population and is supported by neighbouring Armenia. ...

>The blockade continues to have severe consequences for the population; since June 15, 2023 all importation of food, medicine, and fuel has been blocked, and the 120,000 residents of the region are trapped, creating a humanitarian crisis. Shortages of food, medicine, and electricity are widespread with emergency reserves being rationed, alongside massive unemployment and school closures. It is widely suspected that the ""eco-activist"" component of the blockade was orchestrated by the Azerbaijani government as a form of hybrid warfare in its ongoing attempt take control of the region. This is the second time that Azerbaijan has isolated Artsakh through a blockade, with the first blockade lasting three years (1989 - 1992).

>During the current ongoing blockade, Azerbaijan has sabotaged various critical civilian infrastructure of Artsakh: including gas, electricity, and Internet. Artsakh has been without adequate electricity supply since 10 January 2023 (6 months, 3 weeks and 2 days) and without gas supply since March 22, 2023 (4 months, 1 week and 4 days). Artsakh authorities have resorted to daily 6-hour blackouts in order to ration the remaining supply of local electricity production.

>Since 12 December 2022, Azerbaijan has permitted only occasional traffic from the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Russian peacekeepers to pass through the Lachin corridor. The Red Cross and the peacekeepers have transported patients in need of medical care and provided limited humanitarian supplies. Since June 15, 2023, Azerbaijan has completely banned all passage through the Lachin corridor, including humanitarian aid delivered by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers.

10/1/2023,Why are nearly all citizens leaving Artsakh? And why did Shahramanyan agree to dissolve the government?,"Obviously I know about the 10 month blockade and then the sudden attack on Stepanakert, and i understand that many citizens know that they will suffer further injustices living under Azeri rule - and i also understand that azerbaijan would have crushed the army (and civilians) in Artsakh.  

So are those the specific reasons why all citizens are fleeing, and why the government was agreed to be dissolved?

I'm just unclear because in 2020 Armenians put up a fight for over a month.  But this situation just happened so suddenly.

(P.S. How Azeris don't see that they are the 'bad guy' in this situation is mind blowing to me, especially regarding that 10 month blockade on civilians.  Also it's all but officially been declared to be an ethnic cleansing and war crime.  Armenians just want to live in peace, ffs.  So much of that population is children and the elderly.)"

Now take a look at this small place in Syunik that I have marked from Right side of Azerbaijan (current Nagorno Karabakh under control of Artsakh armed forces) and Left side Azerbaijan (Nakhichevan).

https://preview.redd.it/7t0fi7dspet51.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2597558951e8e534ada40d9befcc1bed75869bc

Its just 32 kilometers or 20 miles. A modern army that does a pincer attack from both sides can capture this in 5 minutes and defenders would have virtually no chance of defending. The exact path that I marked is all valleys.

In other words, following Lavrovs plan or caving in to the demands of Aliyev means our ultimate doom. The moment Azerbaijani armed forces can situate army near Syunik you can close the page of history for Armenians. Diaspora would than be assimilated and gone in a generation as well.

If you think I am exaggerating, and ""Russia would never allow this"", think again, because realistically is this were to happen overnight, in another crisis situation like Covid, say when there is instability in Russia, or some kind of US-China war, etc, we would be helpless. Hell even right now they could immediately attack and Russia would not be able to come to help because they would first have to pave through Georgia to get their ground forces to Syunik.

The very second Azerbaijan gains control over Nagorno Karabakh we are on a ticking bomb.

We are fighting not only for the civilians in Artsakh, that are defending their homes and their right to live freely. But also for our country and freedom in all of Armenia. For all of Armenians.

Think about it for a second. Think about your ancestors that have lived on those lands and their heritage. Think about how you will be remembered and what your kids will know as their own identity.

And think what are you ready to give to preserve our future as a nation."

You can forget about initiative and victory. The question is just how bitter your defeat will be.

So what to do? There is just one answer here -  [Garrison State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garrison_State).  
There should be two big types of civilian militia, the one that holds it's city/region/neighborhood, and the one that can carry out military operations along with the army.

Think about Ukraine for a minute. They would have lost the war in a matter of weeks, if it weren't for their armed militias. Think for a minute about the overwhelming advantage Russia had during the first month. They did not got a lot during that period, and yet they successfully resisted the enemy. So don't tell me about Azeris drones for gods sake.

 It is very much achievable. The only question is - are you ready to fight, or not?"

5/1/2023,A Potential deal (Prospect of Iran-Azerbaijan War),"Currently, there seems to be a prospect that Azerbaijan and Iran might go to war in the near to mid term future, likely as an escalation of an Armenia-Azerbaijan war. As such, here I outlined a potential deal between Armenia and Iran for the conclusion of such a conflict.

Would a deal like this be supported by Iranians, in the case of an Iranian victory against Azerbaijan?

Terms:

* The Artsakh Republic receives all the territories delineated within the Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh\_Autonomous\_Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_Autonomous_Oblast)), along with a corridor of land connecting said territory to Armenia - which would include the city of Lachin/Berdzor.
* The Republic of Azerbaijan is reconstituted into the Islamic Republic of Shirvan, a state with a full economic and customs union with Iran. Its institutions will be created under the supervision of Iranian Government officials appointed by the Supreme Leader of Iran. The state will hold an election to officially join the Islamic Republic of Iran within 3 years of its creation. Shirvan will consist of all of Azerbaijan except for the territories listed as a part of Artsakh above.
* All ethnic Azeris within the territories of the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (most importantly within the cities of Shushi and Hadrut) will be offered a payment equivalent to 100,000 roubles to move to any city within Azerbaijan (not counting Nagorno Karabakh) or Iran. Iran and Armenia will help build new housing in Fuzli, Aghdam and Zangilan to accommodate these people. Those who refuse to take the offer will be allowed to stay, however they will have to take Armenian or Artsakh citizenship within 3 months.
* The Islamic Republic of Iran allows for Artsakh and Armenia to formally unify, and formally recognizes the new borders.
* Iran's government will allow for Lukoil and other assorted Russian energy companies to maintain their share of Azerbaijan's oil fields - but otherwise all Azerbaijani energy infrastructure under the control of Azeri or Western enterprises will be transferred to the control of the National Iranian Oil Company. This will remain the case unless the EU & US reintroduce the Iran Nuclear Deal - in which case the west will regain access to its oil assets in Azerbaijan.
* Armenia helps with the reconstruction of various citizens within Shirvan formerly under their occupation, and Iran helps with the reconstruction of various cities in Artsakh and Armenia.
* Azerbaijani citizens will be treated as equal to Iranian citizens under Iranian law. Those holding Azeri passports will have their passports operate the same as Iranian passports under Iranian law within a 5 year grace period. After this grace period it is expected that all current Azerbaijani passport holders convert their passports into Iranian passports.
* A full customs union is created between Armenia and Iran.

The war has already generated mountains of controversy on Armenian, Azerbaijani, and international subreddits, but a new story has sparked additional arguments.

Today, the Azerbaijani government [unveiled a new park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTkJucztrzI) in the capital city of Baku to commemorate the war. Memorial parks are nothing new, but this park features captured military vehicles, displays of helmets from dead Armenian soldiers, manequinns of terrified Armenian soldiers, and other displays that one might consider provocative. What do people have to say about it on r/azerbaijan?

[""A good park, I'll visit one day. But I think all these mannequins are too much. Too cringe. This park was supposed to be a symbol of the victory, not a horror amusement park.""](https://reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/mpd4oo/war_trophy_park_was_opened_in_baku/gu8zsqd/)

The reason being that the Soviets did not yet have nuclear weapons and were forced to withdraw their troops from South Azerbaijan. 

Thereafter Stalin signed an agreement with Iran for oil, only to lose that deal too as the shah refused to sign a further oil pact with Stalin after he had occupied Iranian territory in S. Azerbaijan.

So the USSR really lost this Crisis twice.

You would think that historians, who are mainly American or NATO linked, would like to gloat about this.

Yet often the story of the Cold War skips straight to the more dramatic European standoff.  This kind of seems paradoxical as US history is full of playing up minor victories

They liberated a little more than half, 7 districts of that half are the surroundings of the disputed areas, taken as buffer zone by the Armenians in the 90s. And on top of that not only did they not liberate NK they now have the Russian military there, and they will never leave. And also Putin and Lavrov have already said the status of NK still is not settled. The one page agreement can be interpreted 10 different ways by 10 different lawyers. It's way to vague. They now have land access to Turkey though the corridor that's about all they got out of the war. And they got shushi. And please dont tell me it's called susa go research and read. This place was called shushi since before the Roman empire. But yea Az didn't really win. It was a tie tbh.. both parties had help from 3rd parties.

Throughout the conflict I tried to be unbiased and tbh I believe I managed to do so. I just really believe patriotism is irrational and clouds judgement. Anyway, I am a pacifist and don't believe that any land is worth human lives. Both sides really poeticise these territories too much. I understand if you disagree with me though.

  The thing is, I see that a lot of people are angry at Pashinyan. Yes, the loss happened during his time as prime minister. But do you really think some other person, placed in his shoes, would do better? Would they shoot down the drones with laser beams from their eyes or something? He was a victim of circumstances he found himself in. At least he had the guts to stop the senseless deaths of his people, knowing many would hate him for that. The situation was dire for the Armenian side. You could see that if you were unbiased. So many brutal deaths at the hands of the drones.

  But internally, he fought for democracy and human rights and succeeded it this department quite a lot.  I don't think Armenians should ruin these achievements because of what happened. At the end of the day, democratic countries will always do better in the long-term than non-democratic ones. It would be really sad to see a fledgling democracy ruined because of a desire of revanchism.

I personally believe that the return of 7 districts to Azerbaijan, and self-determination for the Armenians of NK would be the best option for both sides, but sadly it wasn't possible. But ruining a democracy would only be beneficial to your enemies.

2/29/2020,Coronavirus update (Feb 29) in numbers compared to yesterday (DAY TO DAY DELTA),"As of 11 Am Feb 29 GMT +8   there are 85,182 (🔺2,326   vs yesterday 🔺2,228) confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide.

This update consists of 36 hours of new cases and deaths, so it might look like a much larger increase than regularly. 
 
For those who are confused with percentages, it’s day to day delta: the difference of increased (or decreased) numbers compared to yesterday’s increase or decrease. (Except days when I can’t update every 24 hours, in that case day to day % won’t make much sense so I won’t include it at all)

Message to everyone who reads my posts:

First of all thanks for all the good words! I was in this sub since early January, when most of the world had no idea about this virus and nobody took it seriously, only small media attention was visible online. It’s been terrifying but interesting journey, after all this kind of pandemic event does happen just several times during our lifetimes, and we are now witnessing something that will be remembered and talked about for many decades.  But here we are now, and as the virus spreads further, I am trying to keep up with the updates, which became much harder since I am on vacation in the Philippines for one month. 

And for the first time I could personally experience the consequences of this virus: a lot of people in Dubai, Philippines are wearing masks on daily life basis, I could see a lot of new hand sanitizers, alcohol dispensers in public places, sings warning about Coronavirus in airports, train stations, ports and etc. What once seemed like a virus far away from me personally, now it seems much more real. And I wanna say that Philippines seems to be quite well prepared for Coronavirus, salamat!

However I will stay post daily updates, but it might be hard to keep it up for every 24 hours schedule all the time, it the updates might come in every 20-40 hours interval. Thanks everyone!

4/26/2020,I am walking around the world with my dog. AMA!,"Five years ago I left my home in New Jersey to embark on a twenty-five thousand mile, seven continent, walk around the world. After four months of walking I adopted a dog, [Savannah](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9hQXuQhhpg/), and since then we've covered 16,500 miles across thirty-three countries together.

When Savannah was a [pup](https://www.instagram.com/p/7lZeLrFp7K/?taken-by=theworldwalk) I pushed her in my cart. Now she’ll walk thirty miles a day and still be running circles at night. We’ve spent nearly every minute of every day together and from navigating chaotic cities and strange new environments Sav and I are totally in sync. She’s my best bud and absolutely rock solid. (The Dodo recently did [a video on her](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_NdSwnAVtK/).)

I'm walking around the world because of a friend who died at seventeen. Her death led me to understand how fleeting my life was and that I needed to make the most of the short time I had. When I discovered [Karl Bushby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby) the idea of walking around the world stuck in my head as a way to live a full life.

From seventeen to twenty-six I went to college, worked, paid off loans, saved, then set off before I had too much responsibility.

During the first two years of this adventure I walked from New Jersey to Uruguay. I was held up at knife point in Panama, did ayahuasca in the Amazon, and climbed 15,000 feet over the Chilean Andes. The three years since walking The Americas, I was [almost taken out](https://www.facebook.com/TheWorldWalk/photos/a.382245018625792/870555439794745/?type=3&theater) by a bacterial infection, needed seven months to recover, then walked Europe, North Africa, across Turkey and into Georgia. I peregrinated The Camino in Spain, had a twenty-four hour police escort through Algeria, visited the village of my family name (Turčić) in Croatia and became the first private citizen granted permission to cross the Bosphorus Bridge on foot (the Istanbul bridge crosses from Europe to Asia).

After flying home this winter to obtain extended visas for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Savannah and I returned to the road this March but were promptly forced to put our walk on hold. Currently we're in lockdown in Baku, Azerbaijan so I thought this would be the perfect moment for an AMA.

This [infographic](http://theworldwalk.com/infographic/) on my site provides a great visualization of our walk.

And [this video](https://www.facebook.com/Sunrise/videos/311540596150551/) from Sunrise Australia provides the best summation of our journey.

If you'd like to follow along I do my best to post photos daily and write a weekly(ish) blog post.

It's late here in Azerbaijan so I'm signing off for the moment! Thanks for all the great questions, I'll answer some more tomorrow morning!"
10/15/2023,It has been 20 years now...,"20 years ago on this day Ilham Aliyev became the 4th president of Azerbaijan. Under his presidency we saw the the country transition from a hybrid regime to a hereditary monarchy (partly thanks to his father). Cronyism , nepotism , corruption and laundromats became defining features of his rule.  While the economy did enjoy growth starting from 2006; however, all of that ended in 2014 when the price of oil crashed. Nearly a decade has passed since the oil crisis and we still haven't reached to the pre-2014 level of GDP per Capita. I remember back then the government was talking about diversifying the economy and yet here we are and Azerbaijan's economy is still largely based on oil and gas exports. 

In the Second Karabakh War we finally liberated our land's from Armenian occupation and avenged the death of our martyrs and victims of the first war. After the victory there was a sense of optimism among our people that things would finally take a positive turn and obviously that didn't happen. Ilham capitalized on the victory , fashioned himself as some sort of Azerbaijani Bismarck  or Justinian the Great, and now his ratings are higher than ever. The war of course didn't entirely resolve the conflict and we had to wait for another 3 years for the illegal regime to dissolve itself. However, even now I'm not entirely sure that this is the end since there are still Russian soldiers there and we don't know if and when they will ever leave our territories. 

In my opinion Ilham Aliyev is probably one of if not the most controversial figure in Azerbaijan's history.  On one hand he restored Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and kept the country stable but on the other hand he completely destroyed the fragile democracy of Azerbaijan and did very little to improve the living standards. Yes we are better off than what we were in the 90s but  we still have major problems. Our healthcare and education system is a joke, corruption and nepotism is rampant and people have become completely docile. It's almost as if there is a collective cognitive dissonance and we all are suffering from Stockholm syndrome. 

The purpose of my post was to share my thoughts and vent. I don't know if I should be optimistic and stay here and hope that things will change for the better or leave this country. One in every 4 person I talk to is thinking of immigrating to Western Europe or North America. This country's future seems so uncertain to me but at the same time I don't know if moving out is the right option. You open the news and see that the entire world is collapsing. The 2020s is such a chaotic period , it really sucks being a Zoomer. "

9/17/2022,The level of hypocrisy towards Azeris,"I think what Azerbaijan is doing is wrong and I dont support us entering Armenian territory and taking their military posts, and I think we should withdraw troops from there, otherwise it will just cause more death and violence between us(which is probably what Russia wants to achieve). 

HOWEVER, I find it more than hypocritical that we are called agressors by Armenians and the whole world when for 30 years, and at this very CURRENT moment illegal Armenian military units are standing on the territory of Azerbaijan and mining our lands. 

Do I think that Azerbaijan did the right thing by taking Armenian military posts?  NO and NO. Both sides are dying there and our forces should be withdrawn immediately. In fact, if our government really cared about our people , they would never ever do that. 

Do I think that we have a right to enter Armenian territory when they dont recognize and respect our territorial integrity? : Yes, we do. If they dont recognize our territory for 30 years till this day, we have a right to not recognize theirs either(it doesnt mean I think its the right thing to do and it should be done, no)

Do Armenians and the world has a right to call us agressor? : No, not until Armenia is an aggressor on the territory of Azerbaijan and their forces are still occupying part of Azerbaijan and mining our territory. As I said, otherwise it is another level of hypocrisy.

9/20/2023,"Azerbaijan has launched ""anti-terror"" operations in Nagorno-Karabakh, and said it will not stop until ethnic-Armenian separatists surrender.","Tensions in the South Caucasus have been high for months around the breakaway enclave, recognised internationally as part of Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan and Armenia last went to war three years ago.

Baku [ordered](https://azertag.az/en/xeber/statement_by_the_presidential_administration_of_the_republic_of_azerbaijan-2754034) ""illegal Armenian military formations"" to hand over arms and dissolve their ""illegal regime"".

Ethnic Armenians in Karabakh appealed on Tuesday for a ceasefire and for talks to start. But it was clear from the Azerbaijani ultimatum that Baku's aim was to complete its conquest of the mountainous enclave.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan accused Azerbaijan of starting a ground operation aimed at ""ethnic cleansing"". 

Azerbaijan said it had launched its operation in response to the deaths of six people, including four police officers, in two landmine explosions on Tuesday morning.

Air raid sirens then rang out and the sound of artillery and gunfire could be heard in Karabakh's main city. Residential buildings were damaged and journalist Siranush Sargsyan described seeing a building next door being hit.

Karabakh officials said five people had been killed and dozens more wounded, including women and children."

>On Tuesday, September 19, 2023, Azerbaijan began the bombardment of Stepanakert the capital  of Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh). 27 people were killed; 138 people injured. 
>
>Within two days, Artsakh surrendered to Azerbaijan. Artsakh authorities said they had no alternative.

>In February 2023, the International Court of Justice ordered Azerbaijan to open the Lachin Corridor. Instead, Azerbaijan installed a security checkpoint, sealing off the “Road of Life.""
>
>Artsakh has run out of flour to make bread. Hospitals are out of medicines. Stores have no baby formula. Artsakh's dialysis units have shut down. One in three deaths is due to malnutrition.
>
>Former prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno Ocampo, says Azerbaijan is using starvation as a strategy to commit a silent genocide.

>Armenians claim integration will lead to genocide, repeating past Baku and Sumgait pogroms.

>Aliyev's genocidal intent is often expressed in his dehumanization of Armenians.
>
>The silent genocide has become overt. Azerbaijan has mobilized its military along the borders of Artsakh and Armenia since early September, 2023. All-out war would mean another Armenian Genocide. With no reliable allies, Armenian defeat was certain. To save lives, surrender was the only option.

>●      Airlift massive emergency humanitarian aid directly into Artsakh. 
>
>●      Enforce the ICJ’s rulings to open the Lachin Corridor, imposing sanctions on Azerbaijan.
>
>●      Enforce, not waive, Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act and stop all US aid to Azerbaijan.

Seven years ago I left my home in New Jersey to embark on a twenty-five thousand mile, seven continent, walk around the world (which didn’t go entirely to plan due to covid). After four months of walking, I adopted a dog, [Savannah](https://www.instagram.com/p/CREGmyQLXcI/), and together we've covered 22,500 miles across thirty-five countries.

When Savannah was a [pup](https://www.instagram.com/p/7lZeLrFp7K/?taken-by=theworldwalk) I pushed her in my cart. Now she’ll walk thirty miles a day and still be running circles at night. We’ve spent nearly every minute of every day together. From navigating chaotic cities and strange new environments, Sav and I are totally in sync. She’s my best bud and absolutely rock solid. (The Dodo did [a video on her](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_NdSwnAVtK/).)

I'm walking around the world because of a friend who died at seventeen. Her death led me to understand how fleeting my life is and impressed on me the need to make the most of the short time I have. When I discovered [Karl Bushby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby) the idea of walking around the world stuck in my head as a way to live a full life.

From seventeen to twenty-six I went to college, worked, paid off loans, saved, then set off before I had too much responsibility.

During the first two years of this adventure, I walked from New Jersey to Uruguay. I was held up at knifepoint in Panama, did ayahuasca in the Amazon, and climbed 15,000 feet over the Chilean Andes. They were incredibly clarifying years. The endless hours of walking allowed me to reach a profound acceptance of my life, my choices, and my idiosyncrasies.

During the three years after walking The Americas, I was [almost taken out](https://www.facebook.com/TheWorldWalk/photos/a.382245018625792/870555439794745/?type=3&theater) by a bacterial infection, needed seven months to recover, then walked Europe, North Africa, across Turkey, and into Azerbaijan. I peregrinated The Camino in Spain, had a twenty-four-hour police escort through Algeria, visited the village of my family name (Turčić) in Croatia, and became the first private citizen granted permission to cross the Bosphorus Bridge on foot (the Istanbul bridge which crosses from Europe to Asia). These years nurtured in me an appreciation for how history, geography, and circumstance affect everything from culture to the economy in different countries. People are the same everywhere. It's the greater and often uncontrollable forces that affect their and their country’s fate.

Since getting caught in a covid lockdown in Azerbaijan two years ago, the walking has become immensely more challenging. My planned route from Kazakhstan to Mongolia, then walking the coast of Australia, became impossible due to border closures. I made due by walking more of Turkey while waiting for the world to reopen, then walking Uzbekistan and the [mountains of Kyrgyzstan](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRJvzx1rlT7/). But by the time I finished walking Kyrgyzstan, much of the world remained closed, so Savannah and I flew to Seattle and began the last leg of our journey; a three thousand mile walk back home to New Jersey. Strangely enough, this walk across my home country has proved the most difficult section of the journey. With the end in sight, I feel like it's taking every ounce of effort I have just to finish this thing. 

When this is all over I plan to write a memoir and a children's book, but The World Walk has been my life for so long that I'm certain my transition back to normal life won't be easy.

Currently, Sav and I are posted up in Kansas waiting out a winter storm so I thought this would be the perfect moment for an AMA.

▶︎ They burn wheels and release them into the villages to target the collected grass. Cattle breeding is the only livelihood of many people.

▶︎ They steal cattle and use loudspeakers to threaten the peaceful Armenian civilians working in fields. 

▶︎ These could not have been coincidences, it is a series of intentional acts managed from a command point.

##Nagorno Karabakh calls on superpowers to formally recognize its independence and ""nullify the existential threats facing its population""

The statement by Nagorno Karabakh Parlaimentarry parties sends a message to the West, Russia, and the World.

##... to West

Accepting the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples as enshrined in Article 1 of the UN Charter, as well as the ruling of the International Court of Justice according to which the declaration of independence of Kosovo did not violate international law, we call on [every country] to recognize the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, thereby nullifying the most serious existential threats facing its population.

##... to Russia

You have just recognized the independence of Donbas. We have also exercised our right to self-determination in 1991 from a legal point of view, in accordance with international law, the principles of democracy, and the USSR legislation in force at that time.

##... to World 

The world recognized Azerbaijan as an independent state within the limits determined by the internal legislation of the USSR. According to that legislation, at the time of Azerbaijan’s gaining independence, Nagorno Karabakh had nothing to do with that country, otherwise it would not have been included in the United Nations, thus, the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan has nothing to do with the Nagorno Karabakh Republic.

##leave your homeland and go live elsewhere if you don't want to become Azerbaijani citizens | Dictator of Azerbaijan threatens ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno Karabakh who don't want to accept his rule  

Azerbaijani president Aliyev was asked whether it's true that he has agreed to hold direct talks with Nagorno Karabakh Armenians. 

**Aliyev:** Yes. There have been informal talks with Karabakh Armenians for quite some time now, and we plan to continue it. I think it will convince Armenians that the only option is to integrate into Azerbaijani society. 

Those who want to live as citizens of Azerbaijan won't regret it, but if there are people who don't want it, they can choose another place of residence. //

##U.S. again calls on Azerbaijan to withdraw its troops from Armenia 

**Carpenter, U.S. representative of OSCE:** The U.S. remains deeply engaged in helping AM and AZ work toward a peace agreement. Jake Sullivan met with Hikmet Hajiyev and Armen Grigoryan at the White House on September 27 to advance the peace process. 

On October 4, Anthony Blinken held a trilateral call with FM Mirzoyan and FM Bayramov, during which he encouraged confidence-building progress in their talks. Blinken also expressed our appreciation for the positive steps AM and AZ have taken towards reaching a sustainable peace agreement, including and importantly the return of 17 Armenian POWs.

##... about the video showing the execution of Armenian POWs

**Carpenter continues:** The surfacing of an appalling video appearing to show Azerbaijani armed forces executing unarmed Armenian prisoners must be fully and impartially investigated. Those responsible for any abuses of detainees must be held to account. 

We take note of the inquiry which has been launched by the Prosecutor General of Azerbaijan and remind the parties to abide by their commitments to swiftly return all prisoners of war and to treat such prisoners in accordance with their international obligations.

##... about the September 13 attack 

**Continues:** The violations of ceasefire on September 13, 14, and 28, are of grave concern to the U.S. We encourage AM and AZ to strictly adhere to a ceasefire, pull back and distance their armed forces, and continue negotiations on border delimitation to support a peaceful resolution. 

We reiterate our call on Azerbaijan’s forces to return to their September 12 positions. Border disputes must be resolved through negotiations, not violence. 

##... about OSCE 

**Continues:** We strongly support the activation of the OSCE’s confidence-building and conflict prevention instruments, including the establishment of a Fact Finding Mission, as has been requested by Armenia.

We urge AM and AZ to take urgent steps to de-escalate tensions, build confidence, and hold themselves accountable to international obligations and commitments. We encourage further progress in resolving the issue of missing persons and the return of all remaining prisoners of war. //

##Germany's largest party SPD responds to Azerbaijan's military aggression and war crimes:

Azerbaijan's violation of the borders and the territory of Armenia cannot be justified in any way.

We've followed with dismay the recent escalation on the AM-AZ border, including the attacks on homes and civilian infrastructure within Armenia.

A large number of deaths and injuries in Armenia, the escape of many Armenian residents from their hometowns, and the reports of war crimes committed by Azerbaijani soldiers against Armenian captives are unacceptable.

We welcome the recent negotiations and the release of 17 Armenian POWs and urge AM and AZ to continue the dialogue. The Nagorno Karabakh conflict also needs to be resolved. 

We call on the German government and the EU to follow the events, exert more effort, and not accept any violations of international law. //

##EU's statement after the Thursday meeting between the leaders of AM, AZ, EU, FR 

**Statement:** Armenia and Azerbaijan confirmed their commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and the 1991 CIS Declaration, through which both recognize each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

They confirmed it would be a basis for the work of the border delimitation. The next border commission meeting will take place in Brussels this month.

Armenia agreed to facilitate a civilian EU mission alongside the border with Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan agreed to cooperate with this mission as far as it is concerned. 

The mission will begin this month and last 2 months. Its goal is to build confidence and contribute to the border commissions of AM & AZ. //

##Azerbaijan can no longer make territorial claims, must pull back troops from occupied parts of Armenia: Ambassador-at-large Marukyan

**Edmon Marukyan:** Azerbaijan has agreed to cooperate with the EU's border mission. Therefore, any possible future aggression by Azerbaijan will be monitored on the ground, furthermore, the part of Armenia’s sovereign territory that is already under Azerbaijani occupation will be recorded. 

Let me remind you that on October 5, EU's [foreign minister] Josep Borrell had stated that the EU wanted to send a monitoring mission to the line of contact but the mission wasn’t dispatched because Azerbaijan opposed it. 

Azerbaijan has agreed to recognize Armenia in accordance with the UN Charter and the 1991 CIS Declaration, after which Azerbaijan can no longer make any territorial claims against the sovereign territory of Armenia in the delimitation process, which also means that the Azerbaijani military must withdraw from the territories it has occupied until this moment. //

##what do we know about the border monitoring mission from EU?

**Question:** EU's statement says that AM and AZ have agreed to abide by the UN Charter and 1991 CIS agreement on the mutual recognition of borders and territorial integrity. Does this mean Azerbaijan must withdraw its troops from Armenian territories occupied in May 2021 and September 2022?

**Foreign Ministry:** We have repeatedly stated that the territorial integrity of Armenia is not subject to negotiation. The statement by the EU is an important step towards restoring Armenia's territorial integrity. The UN Charter and the 1991 CIS agreement will be the basis for the development of a Peace Treaty and border delimitation. 

**Question:** EU's statement says nothing about Nagorno Karabakh. Did the leaders discuss it? How will the decision to recognize territorial integrity affect the Nagorno Karabakh issue?

**Foreign Ministry:** As we've stated in the past, the key issue is the security and rights of the people of Nagorno Karabakh. This is being discussed during every meeting, including with foreign partners. Azerbaijan does not want to discuss it directly with Armenia. 

Our international partners agree with us about the need to clarify the security and rights of Nagorno Karabakh Armenians. This is why it's important to hold direct talks between Stepanakert (Nagorno Karabakh) and Baku (Azerbaijan), with the formation of an internationally visible mechanism. Armenia raises this issue during every meeting with Azerbaijan.

**Question:** Armenia has agreed to place an EU monitoring mission on the AM-AZ border, whereas Azerbaijan will ""cooperate with this mission as far as it is concerned"". What does this mean? Did Azerbaijan not agree to the mission?

**Foreign Ministry:** Armenia has always insisted on the placement of an international mission. The EU mission will operate on the AM-AZ border, within the sovereign territory of Armenia. There is no question of Azerbaijan's agreement or disagreement. 

**Question:** Where exactly will the mission be deployed, and what will they do?

**Foreign Ministry:** The goal is to strengthen trust and assist the border delimitation/de-escalation commissions of AM and AZ. It's too early to say where they will be deployed, it's being discussed.

##Russian Senator about the EU's border monitoring mission 

**Sergei Tsekov:** The prospect of concluding a peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia can only be assessed positively. Direct dialogue is necessary between the parties. The main thing for the EU's civil mission is not to interfere with this process.

We hope the EU's mission will contribute to the formation of a peace treaty, and not provoke new conflicts. The EU is not a very trustworthy negotiator. Establishing a direct Armenia-Azerbaijan dialogue is more important.

**Ghukasyan:** We were offered a document that essentially recognized Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan. This is not a ""package"" resolution, and we cannot accept an offer like this.

##the Azeri infiltrator who killed an Armenian teenager in 2014 attempted to commit self-immolation in front of Ilham Aliyev's office 

Context: [Shahbaz Guliyev and his accomplices](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/utc8i1/may192022_your_daily_news_digest_from_armenia/) infiltrated the border to spy on Armenian soldiers in 2014. They killed a civilian Armenian teenager during the process. Guliyev was captured in Armenia, and later sent back to Azerbaijan after the 2020 war as part of the prisoner swap. After returning to Azerbaijan, he admitted to being a spy and explained the infiltration details.

Guliyev has long complained about socioeconomic difficulties and being neglected by the Azerbaijani government. During the latest protest on Friday, during which he demanded a disability status and a pension, Guliyev attempted to set himself on fire but was stopped and detained by officers.

##leaders of CIS republics arrive in Russia for a summit 

Putin did not visit the airport to greet Pashinyan - another blow to the already shaky Armenia-Russia relations, according to bored analysts familiar with the inner workings of Kremlin. 

BREAKING: Vladimir Putin did not greet Ilham Aliyev, either. Insiders believe Putin's major health problems have forced him to stay at the palace and greet the arriving leaders all at once, instead of wasting the entire morning at the airport. *(Some of you will get the sarcasm.)*

Anyhow...

##... the CIS leaders held an informal meeting ahead of the summit 

Present were Putin, Lukashenko, Tokayev, Rahmon, Berdimuhamedov, Mirziyoyev, Aliyev, and Pashinyan. 

Putin made sure that Pashinyan and Aliyev sit next to each other: [photo.](https://armenpress.am/static/news/b/2022/10/1094390.jpg) *(analyze this)*

##... Putin got straight to the point:

Sadly, Ukraine is not the only place where tragic events are taking place. It is necessary to implement measures to resolve conflicts in CIS space. *[Armenia vs Azerbaijan, Tajikistan vs Kyrgyzstan]*.

##Armenia's state investment fund ""ANIF"" becomes associate member of *International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds*

>IFSWF is a voluntary organization of global sovereign wealth funds committed to promoting good governance and investment management practices

IFSWF associate membership is for institutions in the early stages of becoming sovereign wealth funds. ANIF has agreed to implement the Santiago Principles. 

**ANIF CEO:** This is also a big step for Armenia that is yet another proof of our country’s commitment to further integration of international best practices on transparency and accountability to our country’s financial sector.

##... about the government's plan to create a ""sovereign wealth fund"" and raise taxes on the mining industry 

**2019:** The Government creates ANIF (Armenian National Interests Fund) with a mandate to attract foreign investments, grow exports, and co-finance investments.

**2021:** The Government raises taxes on copper-molybdenum miners, citing their ""unfair superprofit"" amid rising global metal prices. The plan is to spend the new revenues on a sovereign national fund, the processing industry, and the development of the copper manufacturing ecosystem. *""More specifically, we plan to deepen the value chain of copper processing and establish a high-purity cathode copper production, followed by the development of an adjacent copper ecosystem.""*

>Long-term, we plan to review the taxation policies and to create a ""Sovereign Wealth Fund"" investment fund, which will receive the revenues deriving from these reforms. Many countries already have such Funds that manage the revenues collected from mining. 

**2022:** Possibly related. The government ""nationalizes"" ~22% of Armenia's largest miner/taxpayer Zangezur Copper Combine.

##another interview with military expert Artsrun Hovhannisyan about army reforms 

*With popular demand.*

**Question:** What do the soldiers need before they reach the front lines?

**Artsrun:** They need to train with modern standards, not the Soviet mechanisms. The more intense their training is, the better. This applies to Ashkharazor (Territorial Defense Forces), reservists, and volunteers. This is being done today to the best of our abilities.

The troops today do not have a lot of time and resources to deal with volunteer squads constantly. The adoption of one of the pending resolutions in parliament will address many problems: there will be a training process for the aforementioned groups and even civilians. 

They must have physical strength, the ability to shoot, the ability to navigate the terrain, and basic knowledge of weapons and tech. After the law is adopted, it will no longer be necessary to complete this process in a hurry within a week. 

Instead, there will be seasonal training that can last a few months, for proper training. Other countries do it for 30-40 days. A former serviceman can be brought to combat state with a 30-40 day retraining. 

Armenia has long had many private military training organizations but they are disorganized and unregulated. I'm studying the experience of other countries to help draft a law to regulate this. Hopefully will be ready this winter. 

**Question:** Is it true that only the poor are being summoned?

**Artsrun:** No. Reservists are summoned based on their profession, the type of mission, etc.

**Question:** Tell us about September 13 attack.

**Artsrun:** We have soldiers who are just now leaving the trenches after being there since the night of September 12. Many of our boys committed heroism. I'll write about it later. 

**Question:** What do soldiers need on the front lines? 

**Artsrun:** The army provides the necessities, but we could always use մանր-մունր things like warmer clothes, more socks, etc. There is never ""too much"" of those. The food is great, but some kids prefer to eat more chocolate, more than the army delivers.

##the battle of Qarin Tak & невероятные приключения Գյուլլնազ տատի
 
**Russian reporter Kotenok:** I got a report that on October 31st the Turkish-Azeri infiltrator group suffered heavy losses and were thrown back. The 200-member group reached Qarin Tak [2km south of Shushi] and tried to bypass the Armenian troops to enter Shushi.
 
The group was equipped with Turkish and Pakistani special forces, Syrian mercenaries, and members of Azeri ""052 Yashma"" special forces. They fell under Armenian fire and were destroyed. Armenians mostly used mortars and rifles against the enemy that was trying to settle on top of a hill. After leaving 50 dead and wounded, the infiltrators retreated.
 
The second group of Turks tried to advance but was stopped under a fire. After this, the Azeris haven't tried an attempt in this direction. *[on November 1st the army spokesman Artsrun did mention something about ""Hell Gorge"" and how Azeris were ambushed, might be this incident]*
 
After this incident, Azeris began circulating rumors that the attack was actually called off because 300 Russian Wagner Group mercenaries are allegedly in Shushi, so they didn't want to engage the Russians.

**17:55 army spokesman Q&A:** some soldiers stay in front lines much longer because it's impossible to conduct shift rotation, especially if it's still being attacked. 

Even if you manage to change the troops overnight, the new ones won't be as effective and knowledgeable, which could compromise the security. The new troops must adapt first, which is impossible during intense battles. There is a shift change in relatively milder areas.

**22:00 army spokesman Artsrun's briefing:** as announced earlier, last night Azeris launched multiple attacks in the north-west direction. Both attacks were repelled. Some of them were trapped and destroyed completely.
 
Around 7:00 Azeris attacked near Martakert-Martuni (center front) and southern front. All attacks were repelled. In some locations, they were chased and our troops captured some positions. 

South of Martuni (towards Chartar) Azeris took 1-2 positions; later we launched artillery strikes and caused heavy casualties to them in these positions.
 
The battles continue. Overall, all the attacks failed today. They used mostly groups of infantry and aviation. We monitor the enemy's movements and penetrated mainly with artillery.
 
In some areas, Azeri bodies have been lying on battlefields in front of our positions for 20-30 days. Azerbaijan refuses to collect them because they don't care about them. 

Today, near one of the villages in the Hadrut region, Azeri groups left 15-16 dead bodies and routed. Sometimes the bodies can cause issues with disease, sometimes not.
 
The Azeri infantry and armored vehicle fleet have sustained significant damage. It's visible in the past 10 days. They often use mercenary terrorists who attack without armored vehicles, although they try to aid them with air and artillery.
 
Q: is it true that Azeris can monitor every location and movement of our positions?
 
A: entirely possible, since Turkey is in charge of the Azeri army and uses its equipment. But it's not a catastrophic thing. We also have reconnaissance tools. It's not just about hiding, it's also about misleading the enemy with your actions.
 
Q: who produced and sold the phosphorus bombs to Azerbaijan?
 
A: we're investigating.
 
The war continues. The enemy continues to attack in all directions with the use of a wide range of weapons. We carry out our defense duties appropriately by causing heavy casualties to the enemy. 

The war is hard but I'm confident that our soldiers are in charge. They gain experience day by day. They study the enemy, better analyze their plans, and find better antidotes against their high-tech. Be confident, we will win.

##the economy
 
**Deputy PM Mher:** It was possible to ensure a stable micro-business environment despite the pandemic and the war. It's unprecedented. It's a result of effective cooperation with the Central Bank. 2021 will be a tense year but I'm sure we'll approve a suitable budget.
 
**Finance Minister Atom:** the 2021 budget assumes a 6% economic fall in 2020, and 4.8% growth in 2021. These predictions can change.
 
With the restoration of demand, inflation is expected to approach the lower limit of the target.
 
The year began with high growth but COVID stopped it. April was the worst. Slightly recovered in May when physical restrictions were lifted. Got worse again in June, followed by improvement in August. The Services industry was hit the worst.
 
The Debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 65% in 2020 and lower to 63.2% in 2021.
 
**Central Bank president Martin:** The state budget deficit relative to GDP will reduce by 2% in 2021. After the debt expansion in 2020, there will be a certain restraining policy in 2021 guided by the principle of ensuring medium-term debt stability.

Azerbaijan has blocked the Lachin corridor since December 2022 and has fully cut off the delivery of food since June 2023, in violation of the World Court order to lift the blockade. Deaths caused by starvation have already been recorded. Families are forced to register to receive bread from bakeries; the lines are formed starting at 4 a.m. because the supplies are scarce. Starting today, each family will receive no more than 1 bread per day.

Azerbaijan has, for months, blocked the entry of dozens of cargo trucks sent from Armenia, causing a humanitarian crisis. Now the Aliyev regime wants to pretend that it cares about the well-being of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, complain the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, who are concerned that Azeri food trucks will contain poisoned food.

Nagorno-Karabakh's main opposition figure Samvel Babayan has [proposed a plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/15m6e4j/us_sources_have_offered_a_near0_interest_loan_to/): Open the Lachin corridor and the Agdam road. Allow free movement of goods and persons between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. Install laboratories near the Agdam road to check the safety of incoming food from Azerbaijan, and allow the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh to conduct trade with Azeri businesses if they wish. Let the ""market"" decide where the products should come from.

Azerbaijan has so far refused to hold negotiations with Nagorno-Karabakh in a location that would guarantee the physical safety of the Nagorno-Karabakh diplomats.

**Analyst Karen Hovhannisyan:** By offering to send ""food aid"", Azerbaijan has admitted the existence of the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh, something they have denied until now. //

The Nagorno-Karabakh government has accused Azerbaijan of attempting to ""aggravate and not solve the existing problems"".

**Government:** The Lachin corridor should operate freely. If the Azerbaijani authorities are truly interested in ending the gravest humanitarian crisis and genocide of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, they should not play fake humanism, but simply not prohibit the resumption of supplies through the Lachin corridor. //

**Nagorno-Karabakh residents gathered near the Agdam road:** We won't accept anything from the murderer [Azerbaijani leader Aliyev]. We will not allow an ant to cross this road. This is a road of death, not life. This is the latest state-sanctioned show by terrorist state Azerbaijan, which has never pursued a peace agenda towards us. Our parents were murdered during the ethnic cleansing in Sumgayit and Baku [Azerbaijan]. Meanwhile, Azerbaijani authorities continue to spread hatred towards ethnic Armenians. Open the Lachin corridor immediately, remove the illegal checkpoint. //

##Azerbaijan's policy towards Nagorno-Karabakh is illegal and immoral: France

**Catherine Colonna, FM of France:** The strangulation strategy aimed at provoking mass emigration of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh is illegal, as the World Court has already determined. This policy is also immoral.

France will mobilize forces to establish a just and lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan. A just and stable peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan will also allow the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their homeland and their rights, culture and history will be respected.

##update to the kidnapping of 3 ethnic Armenian students by Azerbaijan army 

*Context: Yesterday Azeri soldiers forcefully kidnapped 3 residents of Nagorno-Karabakh who attempted to travel via the Lachin corridor that has been illegally blocked by Azerbaijan against World Court orders. They will be deported to Armenia soon, and will not be allowed to return back to their homeland. It's a ""one-way trip"" policy by Azerbaijan to depopulate Nagorno-Karabakh.*

Protests were organized in front of the Russian embassy in Armenia for allowing the students to be kidnapped. Russian peacekeepers were supposed to accompany the students. 

Armenian media outlet 5TV (Robert Kocharyan) reported that Russian peacekeepers got into a scuffle with Azeri forces in an attempt to protect the students, but the eyewitnesses have a different account of the events. 

Multiple witnesses have reported that the peacekeepers did nothing to prevent the kidnappings. One of the students, who was not kidnapped, recalls how the kidnapped student asked the peacekeepers for help during the physical altercation with 7 Azeri agents but received no assistance. He was beaten and struck multiple times with a rifle in various parts of his body.

##Nagorno-Karabakh government discussed the idea of deploying international peacekeepers 

The current and former leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh, joined by Parliament MPs, public figures, and civil society activists, held an emergency meeting last night to discuss the situation.

**Activist Artur Osipyan:** The topic of holding negotiations with Azerbaijan in Yevlakh, Azerbaijan, was discussed but [the location is unsafe] and it would allow Azerbaijan to treat the situation as an ""internal matter"", which is unacceptable. The same about the Agdam road. It's part of Azerbaijan's goal to subjugate us. If we agree to this, they will demand the dismantling of our defense forces as the next step. This will be followed by Azerbaijan sending police forces to Nagorno-Karabakh, leading to the final destruction of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

Multiple scenarios were discussed for opening the Lachin corridor. Two of us supported the idea of organizing a march towards the illegal checkpoint in the corridor. 

No final decisions were made during the meeting because we're waiting for a response from Russia. 

We also discussed the involvement of international peacekeepers. I get it, we heavily depend on Russian peacekeepers, but the idea that requesting international peacekeepers could upset Russia and prompt them to leave no longer matters because we are going to collapse due to a shortage of food anyway, so what do we have to lose? The Parliament MPs did not explicitly support the idea of requesting international peacekeepers. It's strange. What are they waiting for? We will know more in the coming days. //

**Nagorno-Karabakh president after the meeting:** It is necessary to restore the unobstructed traffic through the Lachin corridor. We are ready to solve the problems through constructive negotiations with Azerbaijan. //

##Aliyev regime is creating a uni-party system in Azerbaijan by outright banning opposition parties: opposition figures from Azerbaijan

**Azerbaijan's National Council of Democratic Forces:** Ilham Aliyev has pursued a policy of eliminating all opposition throughout his 20 years of rule. The latest anti-democratic law targets the political parties and is meant to destroy the true opposition. It will essentially make it illegal and criminalize opposition parties. We are headed to a monarchy.

This is an assault on the entire population of Azerbaijan, who are being deprived of peaceful means to change the government. We hope the international community will address Ilham Aliyev's attempts to establish a uniparty system in Azerbaijan. 

##... what is in the new ""uniparty"" law?

A political party must have >5,000 members to be officially registered as a party. It will lose registration if the numbers drop below 4,500. There are other minimum requirements as well.

Even popular opposition parties are struggling to meet all the criteria under the new law. ""The requirement to go through a state registry is a tool for the government to destroy opposition parties, especially the Popular Front, because it will be able to use the list of members to put pressure on people,"" said an opposition figure.

Various European institutions have criticized the new law.

##a private investor will build a large thermal power plant to sell electricity in Armenia's newly liberalized energy market 

Tashir Group will invest >$26m to build a new ""unique"" gas piston power unit, ""the first of its kind in Armenia"". 

Unlike in the past, when a company had to sign a deal with the government to guarantee the purchase of electricity, the new plant will instead find consumers and sell the electricity ""directly"" to them through the wholesale electricity market, which was established by the government in February 2022.

The construction will end in August 2024. Another 3 months will be required to connect it to the power grid. If necessary, it can be quickly connected to the power system to cover the peak power load or be shut down.

9/14/2023,Biden-Harris on Artsakh: A Point-by-Point Evaluation,"*The Biden-Harris Administration stands squarely on the wrong side of Artsakh, aligning with Azerbaijani and Turkish dictatorships against America’s longstanding commitments to genocide prevention, self-determination, indigenous rights, and regional peace.*

1. The Biden-Harris Administration actively dismisses and aggressively downplays Azerbaijan’s genocidal blockade against Artsakh, an act of denial of and complicity in this crime aimed at delivering for regional dictators a “peace” plan that will integrate Artsakh into Azerbaijan. This genocidal plan represents a death sentence for 120,000 indigenous Christian Armenians.
2. President Biden’s State Department pressures Congress and the international community to misrepresent Azerbaijan's blockade of Artsakh as a “conflict” to be solved as opposed to a genocide to be prevented – which is directly at odds with our legal and moral responsibilities under the U.N. Genocide Convention.
3. The moral and legal responsibility of the Biden-Harris Administration to prevent genocide in Artsakh is heightened in light of U.S. participation in negotiations and ongoing U.S. military aid to the Azerbaijani regime committing this atrocity – as reflected in repeated waivers by the Biden Administration of Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act.
4. The Biden-Harris Administration has failed to enforce U.S. statutory sanctions (under Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act, Section 502B, Global Magnitsky, Leahy Laws, among others), or to press for United Nations sanctions against Azerbaijan – and continues to greenlight U.S. military aid to the Azerbaijan military.
5. The Biden-Harris Administration has failed to hold Azerbaijan and its Turkish allies accountable for war crimes, including the use of prohibited munitions (cluster bombs and white phosphorous), deployment of foreign mercenaries, the presence of U.S. parts in Azerbaijan’s fleet of Turkish UAVs, and – of course, - its abuse and murder of POWs.
6. The Biden-Harris Administration has failed – directly, multilaterally, or internationally – to organize an airlift of U.S. humanitarian assistance to Artsakh – an undertaking with multiple precedents that is well within the capabilities of the U.S. government. Even prior to the imposition of Azerbaijan’s blockade in December of 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration provided no humanitarian aid to at-risk families in Artsakh.

It is not too late for the Biden-Harris Administration to step back from these failed policies, resetting our strategic approach to Artsakh in alignment with our true interests and enduring values as a nation, by:

* **Designating Azerbaijan’s blockade of #Artsakh as a genocide**
* **Stopping all U.S. arms and military assistance to Azerbaijan**
* **Sending humanitarian assistance directly to Artsakh via airlift**
* **Pressuring Azerbaijan to lift its genocidal blockade of Artsakh**
* **Securing Azerbaijan’s immediate release of Armenian POWs**
* **Enforcing sanctions on Turkey and Azerbaijan for war crimes**

Until President Biden undertakes these common-sense steps, U.S. Senators must – consistent with America’s commitment to genocide prevention - place an immediate hold on all of President Biden’s nominees to the U.S. Department of State.

Concerned citizens can urge their Senators to take this urgently needed action by visiting [http://anca.org/hold](http://anca.org/hold).

7/24/2023,Russia washes its hands off from the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis and shifts the blame to Armenia with a disingenuous claim: Analysis by Tatul Hakobyan and Petros Ghazaryan.,"**TATUL**: Azerbaijan continues with its inhumane policy of starving Nagorno-Karabakh with a blockade. Today we'll discuss possible solutions.

**PETROS:** We first need to understand who is responsible and what can be done. Russia's foreign ministry has accused the Pashinyan administration of making it ""impossible"" for Russian peacekeepers to help Nagorno-Karabakh, citing ""Pashinyan's recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh's status within Azerbaijan"". This has energized the pro-Russian opposition forces in Armenia: *""See! Russia has named the real traitor!""*.

But Russia is manipulating.

Armenia has not signed any agreements recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan. Pashinyan said he is willing to do so if Azerbaijan can guarantee the rights and protections of ethnic Armenians. If not, then we won't sign it. Russia's foreign ministry and pro-Russian opposition forces in Armenia understand this but they'd rather engage in demagoguery. 

Besides that, there is a tripartite Nov. 9 agreement, which Russia says is still active and valid, stating that Russia must guarantee the free movement in the Lachin Corridor, so it doesn't matter what the Armenian government is willing to sign in the future.

**TATUL**: Last year Azerbaijan rejected Russia's proposal that would have postponed the discussion of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. *[Context: Russia proposed delaying talks around the Nagorno-Karabakh status. Pashinyan agreed, calling Russia's solution as his preferred choice. He went to Russia to negotiate with Aliyev but the latter rejected Russia's proposal. Russia did nothing to promote its own proposal, prompting criticism and disappointment from Armenia. Afterward, the parties began to heavily prioritize the platforms offered by the Brussels and Washington instead.]*

**Tatul continues:** Russia knows very well it was Azerbaijan that rejected their proposal, not Armenia. 

Let me remind you that, even before Pashinyan's announcement about his readiness to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan IF Azerbaijan provides strong guarantees, well before this statement, Russia was already failing to follow its duties. 

The Khtsaberd incident, the capturing of dozens of Armenian soldiers, and Russia not securing their return to Armenia took place well before Pashinyan's statement. 

The invasion of village Parukh [and Russia's refusal to remove Azeri soldiers] took place well before Pashinyan's statement. 

**PETROS:** ... and the blockade of the Lachin Corridor that began 7 months ago and Russia's refusal to open it took place several months *before* Pashinyan's statement.

Azerbaijan invaded hundreds of km^2 of Armenian territories. Armenia asked for assistance from Russia but received a rejection. Why? There were no EU border observers in Armenia at the time. The EU observers were brought in response to Russia's inaction.

Our opposition is for some reason obsessed with justifying Russia's inaction at any cost. 

Our opposition also claims that Russia didn't provide military assistance because Armenia ""refused to fight"", so Russia didn't want to do all the work for Armenia. But we did fight in September, yet still didn't receive assistance. Russian border guards, instead of helping, withdrew their positions from the border.

Doesn't the ostrich Maria Zakharova not see and know about this?

Aren't the hungry people of Nagorno-Karabakh fighting tooth and nail today? Yet they still receive no assistance from Russia...
  
**TATUL**: Russian peacekeepers are currently delivering food with helicopters for themselves while the children of Nagorno-Karabakh are starving to death a few kilometers away.

Now let's discuss several possible solutions.

Solution 1. Armenia pressures Azerbaijan to reopen the corridor. This cannot work at the moment because Armenia's military is not yet powerful enough.

**PETROS:** Some figures in Armenia are calling for Armenians to apply force. This would be an excellent gift for Azerbaijan, giving them the legitimacy to invade even more territories and invade all of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

**TATUL**: Solution 2. The international community pressures Azerbaijan. In this scenario, the civilized world, which is the Western powers in this case, could exert enough influence to end the blockade. But we must remember that the same EU is receiving the [banned] Russian gas through Azerbaijan today. Azerbaijan is marking Russian gas as its own before exporting it to the EU to bypass the sanctions. Everyone knows about this but it's being ignored. Nevertheless, as an active member of international platforms, Armenia must carry on with the efforts to remind the international community to pressure Azerbaijan.   

**PETROS:** Many major international institutions/organizations have already sided with Armenia and urged Azerbaijan to lift the blockade. But we shouldn't stop there.

**TATUL**: Solution 3. Russia pressures Azerbaijan to lift the blockade. But I think Russia doesn't want to pressure AND couldn't pressure.

**PETROS:** However, the latest statement made by the foreign ministry of Russia is a word-by-word copy of Armenia's policy. In it, Russia demanded Azerbaijan open the Lachin Corridor *immediately* and to create international mechanisms for the protection of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. Their message mirrored the Armenian narrative. This prompted Azerbaijan to send a note of protest to Moscow; the ambassador was summoned.

**TATUL**: Solution 4. Armenia asks Turkey to pressure its little brother Azerbaijan. This may seem far-fetched, but it has been done in the past, during the era of the first republic. At the time, the bread and oil were entering Armenia exclusively through Azerbaijan. In the summer of 1918, Azeris cut off the flow to pressure Armenia. Armenia's foreign minister Khatisyan asked Enver Pasha [the co-organizer of the Armenian genocide just 3 years earlier] to pressure their brother Azerbaijan to resume the flow. This is part of our history that isn't being mentioned much.

**PETROS:** I think some people would have an acute psychiatric episode if they heard this. 

**TATUL**: Solution 5. A direct dialogue between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. I've been speaking about this for 1.5 years. Sadly, the government of Nagorno-Karabakh still rejects this idea. I don't know why they fear a direct dialogue. [Only one figure in Nagorno-Karabakh has the courage to publicly support it: Gen. Samvel Babayan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/14jvrcl/direct_negotiations_between_nagornokarabakh_and/) You could always reject Azerbaijan's demands at the end, but at least go and talk to them. *[Context: Nagorno-Karabakh president has revealed that Azerbaijan was demanding the dissolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh defense army as a precondition for direct talks. The Nagorno-Karabakh side wants negotiations without preconditions, and wants to be recognized as an ""equal party"".]*

Scenario 6. Azerbaijan successfully carries out ethnic cleansing and genocide. This is where we are headed unless things change.

**21:00 Pashinyan addresses the nation:** proud citizens of Armenia, Artsakh, and the diaspora. It's been a month since the Turk-Azeri-terrorist army wage a war against Artsakh and Armenians. Thousands of bombs have been fired at civilians, thousand of drones. The enemy attacked with tanks, jets, helicopters, Azeris, mercenaries, Turkish and Pakistani special forces.

A month ago they had a plan to bring Artsakh to its knee. Yet today, although wounded, Artsakh is standing, thanks to primarily our heroic army and heroic public.

This cruel but heroic process reassures us that Artsakh will continue to stand because our spirit is unbreakable. 

The war has entered a stage where every moment it collapses the illusions that the opponent had. The military-political leadership of Azerbaijan has fed so much ""victory news"" to the Azeri public, that every moment the Azeri public awaits news about Artsakh's final fall.

The Azeri public, however, will not receive that news. They will not get it. And it is this indefinite expectation of this news that will collapse the Azeri plans to invade Artsakh.

Artsakh's people, Armenian people, all Armenians will fight until the end for every tree, for every stone and every millimeter, and the counter-attack at the right moment will have a disastrous effect and will collapse the opponent. Developing that moment [counter attack] is the task of the Artsakh army and we must aid them in any way possible. 

To solve the aforementioned problem we need national unity. Military orders must be carried out unconditionally. Those who disobey must be held accountable because Artsakh is at stake.

I'm aware that my yesterday's speech [about Armenia's willingness for ""painful"" mutual compromise] raised some questions and discussions. It was aimed to inform the international community about our constructive stance and the determination to secure rights for Artsakh. 

We must use the energy for Artsakh. Everything and everyone for Artsakh. Every part of the govt works to resolve problems and improve efficiency. Our resources aren't unlimited, but Artsakh's defense army has enough weapons and the potential to carry out its missions.

Yes, we have many enemies around the world, but we also have allies who have/are/will stand next to us. Armenian people won't forget that.

We must defend Artsakh's right to self-determination. This war must be a top priority for all of us, and we will win. This war has radically changed the perception of the Artsakh war around the world. 

International leaders today openly state that Azeris and Turkey are the aggressors. The use of terrorists by Azerbaijan has been confirmed in the world. This was possible partly due to our diplomatic work. 

Diplomatic work is done to show the world that Azerbaijan has never wanted to go for any concessions. This fact gives international legitimacy for Artsakh Armenians to fight until the end.

Let's agree not to be afraid of anything and not to allow the internal and external actors to stoke doubt in our free and happy future.

You are a victor, Armenian nation. Go and take your victory, create your victory, and have no doubt that your government will not stop guiding you the way to victory.

Glory to freedom, glory to the Republic of Armenia, Glory to the Republic of Artsakh, Glory to the Armenian army and the soldier, Glory to children who will live in free and happy Armenia, free and happy Artsakh. Thank you.

**22:00 army spokesman Artsarun's briefing:** in the morning Azeris launched an attack in different directions. They shelled civilian settlements, as mentioned earlier.

The northern front was relatively less tense. 

The fight continues against infiltrator groups in several villages in the center-east [map shows slightly north of Hadrut]. It's mostly inside forests. It's usually small groups that carry light weapons. They flee and hide after our attack. Later they try to infiltrate from other locations. These light-intensity fights happen 24/7 here.

In the south, there are battles along the Vorotan river basin [which stretches north towards Lachin]. Today Azeris tried to organize an attack with the use of drones and artillery towards Lachin [further north] and towards the Armenian border [further north-west], but they were repelled and did not succeed.

As you can tell by the map [presents a map], after having some success in the plain flatlands, Azeris and international terrorists are trying to attack the mountains, but successes are not easy for them. That's a harder task and the battles are heavier for them.

The war continues. It's slightly different now, however. The battles aren't as heavy and fast, although they are still heavy battles on mountains, forests, and gorges. 

Several infiltrator groups were neutralized today. A few more routed, leaving behind equipment.

The nature of today's war is slightly unusual, slightly difficult. The enemy has lost its overwhelming advantage and equipment advantage, partly due to the terrain of warfare, the improvement of our tactics, our experience. 

Therefore the situation is slightly different today. I can't give you all the data dynamically because the dynamics are not the same anymore, it has changed. 

Be confident. We will win.

**7:39**: a rumor circulated from a sketchy Azeri social media outlet that an Azeri general [Mais Barkhudarov](https://youtu.be/ZRt5dk02ZaA?t=8) was captured by Armenians last night. He is a major figure and was promoted as general after April 2016 bates. No official sources confirmed the rumor.

What do we know so far? General Barkhudarov was promoted and was leading the Azeri 2nd corps. Yesterday, the Armenian army reported capturing Azeri vehicles belonging to 2nd corps after a counter-attack. 

Later, Armenia officially denied capturing the general but said they haven't identified all the dead Azeri bodies after last night's battles, so the general's body could, in theory, be among them.

**13:48 Armenian MFA:** Artsakh is fighting against the Azeri-Turkish alliance. Turkey is directly involved and is supplying personnel and equipment. They are helping Azerbaijan to continue the century-old genocidal activities in the South Caucasus. The Turkish-Azeri murderous alliance is a threat to the people of this region. Armenia and Artsakh are determined to resist and neutralize the threat. Azerbaijan will be forced to cease its attempts to solve the conflict with the use of force.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1029219.html


**14:05 Artsakh army:** we are currently dealing heavy blows to the enemy in the frontlines. Azeri forces, joined by Turkish and terrorist groups, are receiving a harsh response. They are spreading misinformation about big successes.

They are mostly minorities. Why is Aliyev's fascist regime using you and your children as pawns? Take your kids away. Shield them. Disobey Aliyev's orders. This is not your war. They are sending you to die on the Armenian Karabakh mountains. Save your children's lives. Today Aliyev stopped international flights to prevent you from leaving in the event you don't want to take part in his crime.

**15:04 what did Pashinyan and Aliyev agree upon during Dushanbe Meeting in 2018?:** During an interview, Pashinyan said that when there was a mass pro-democracy movement in Armenia in 2018, he launched an open dialogue with the Azeri public to talk about internal Azerbaijani issues. The excited Azeri public made calls for a similar revolution in Azerbaijan.

When he met Aliyev, the latter asked him to tone down the pro-democracy rhetoric aimed at the internal Azerbaijani situation, because Aliyev had concerns that the situation was destabilizing in Azerbaijan ""and could threaten his dictatorial regime."" 

""Aliyev didn't care about the Karabakh conflict. He was afraid that the wave of revolution would reach him.""

Pashinyan exposed the aforementioned in response to Aliyev's claim that Pashinyan had asked Aliyev for ""time"" to sort things out in Armenia after the revolution.

Pashinyan confirmed the existence of this agreement with Aliyev, saying ""internal issues in Azerbaijan is not on my agenda"" and this ""agreement helped establish peace on the border and save Armenian lives"".

**Context:** Armenia and Azerbaijan would end up establishing a lengthy ceasefire until a verbal escalation by Azerbaijan in 2019, followed by Pashinyan's claim that ""if Azerbaijan refuses to discuss the possibility of Artsakh being free then Artsakh is Armenia, period"". This phrase was followed by a brief period of verbal exchange, but the two sides relaxed and even organized a surprised humanitarian mission in which Armenian and Azeri journalists visited one another's country to ""move people closer"". Things got worse again in 2020 after the oil plummeted to record-low and Turkish currency kept nosediving amid a worsening economy and Erdogan's reckless foreign policy.

Some of us hate him, condemn him, some of us do not give f about him, some of us praise him and say that he had own ""fair reasons"" to kill him (""fair"" reasons include he and his family forcibly fled from Jabrayil and he witnessed some brutal actions, and (according to him) he was threatened with death and bullied by the guy he killed)

Edit: I myself do not give f about him and condemn his action. His action is a disgrace for his nation and witnessing brutalities do not give him a right to do things he had witnessed or heard.

Thanks u/SadCampCounselor for pointing out in the right direction. Now I know [Why Russian peacekeepers don’t ensure humanitarian aid entry from Armenia to Karabakh?](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/15h5p7h/why_russian_peacekeepers_dont_ensure_humanitarian/)   

The terrible question I have for you dear PM, why even you wouldn't know that? Why to ask such obsolete questions basically. The Nov agreement is now under 5 layers  of newly signed papers which basically neutralise any legal duty on Russia's forces in NK such as protecting Lachin or anything Armenian in NK, all together!!! Why it has not been denounced properly? 

I was thinking until now, it was just a text focused on potential foreign aggressions but the agreement is clearly directed against Artsakh people and practically neutralises all military support obligations from Russia (or even CSTO), to Armenia, in case of an Azeri aggression. 

This is at least the interpretation I'm making, and I'm not a lawyer but I have some legal background and I dealt with contracts, so to me It sounds absolutely catastrophic for Karabagh Armenian, but feel free to share you input if you think different. 

TL;TR , my interpretation, **Russia already removed all legal obligation to act upon any cease-fire violation in NK coming specifically from Azerbaijan. The Nov peace agreement lost all its colours . In a very nutshell-basic way, Russian peacekeepers are no longer having the mission they had in 2020. They are now committed to support Azerbaijan to suppress any threat to the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan**. Just an opinion that this or that is a threat seems to be enough to act against Artsakh, weather it's a group of Artsakhtsi men rebelling against today's situation or even an organisation in Russia supporting Artsakh...  they are all now technically  under Moscow's hammer, too.  Here why:

*1. The Russian Federation and the Republic of Azerbaijan build their relations on the basis of allied interaction, mutual respect for independence, state sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the state borders of the two countries, as well as* ***adherence to the principles of non-interference in each other's internal affairs,*** *equality and mutual benefit,* ***peaceful settlement of disputes and non-use of force or threat of force.***

Basically this agreement gives 0 care for people, the minorities, nothing at all...it is just a State worshiper-agreement, all the pluses to re-enforce the State powers by walking over people's rights. And the principle of non-interference means , well, it's not Russia's business what Azerbaijan decided to do with Karabagh Armenians for instance. They can go an arrest everyone right today, and no one has any legal basis to complaint to Russia anymore! Russians can ask explainations but can't use force to stop them.  

*7. The* ***Russian*** *Federation and the Republic of Azerbaijan refrain* ***from any actions that, in the opinion of one of the Parties****,* ***damage*** *the strategic* ***partnership*** *and* ***allied relations*** *of the two states. To this end, they are establishing a permanent mechanism of consultations through the ministries of foreign affairs of the two countries.*

So if you wonder, well, there must be some red lines where Russia would jump-in and defend Artsakh people, example, by forcing through the humanitarian cargo, according to this agreement, Russia must follow what Azeris just believe to be right for them. No need for proofs, nothing...Just if Baku don't like something, Russia should follow as it says ***'opinion of one of the parties'***.

*9. The* ***Russian*** *Federation and the Republic of Azerbaijan will continue to* ***contribute in every possible way to*** *the efforts to implement provisions of the statements of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia and the President of the Russian Federation dated* ***9/10 November*** *2020, 11 January 2021 and 26 November 2021, which served as a basis for strengthening stability and security, unblocking all economic and transport ties in the region and normalizing relations between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia.*

In terms of mandatory features of the Nov agreement, as you can see the point 9 only confirms there aren't any. As it says ***contribute in every possible way***. So if Russia decides that is no longer possible to fire a bullet against an Azeri soldier - which is certainly the case based on this agreement - they should not fire any. They decide what's possible or not, which gives an unlimited room for shift. 

*11.* ***The Russian Federation and the Republic of Azerbaijan resolutely suppress on their territories the activities of organizations and persons directed against the state sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the other Party.***

This is it's a total monster rule, the worse part  from the entire agreement in my assessment at least. It says, both Russia and Azerbaijan should fight anyone unhappy with Baku's rule basically. It's a legal framework which authorises Azeri soldiers to enter right now Artsakh. Russia is committing not to interfere and should Support Azeri soldiers if need. We shouldn't soften the stance of this text as factually, well, This article to some extend at least defines Artsakh people as the enemy of Russia and Azerbaijan, that's exactly what it is because obviously every single Artsakhtsi are for a sovereign State of Artsakh. So they are a target if they do something in that sense, anything.

If Azeris start invading now Artsakh, as per the allied agreement Russia has no obligation in any shape of form to stop them. Furthermore they have to support Azeris persecution of Armenians which are believe by Baku to be a threat for instance by arresting someone even in Moscow and handing over to Baku.  This explains also why Russians never airdropped any help, why we had lost Lachin just like that, why Araik asked to mandate Russian pk under UN's hospices? This explains a lot but one thing, why is Nicole still talking about the Nov agreement even? He should denounce the new alliance which is the reason why we have the blockade that started a few months after the alliance with Russia signed. 

Solutions?

1. Armenia need urgently a new agreement with Russia which manages conflicts with other treaties/agreements they signed. And those conflicts should work on re-establishing the value of the Nov agreement. 
2. If Russia is not happy to offer minimum guaranties to Artsakh people, then there are No more peacekeepers in NK. We are then back to Nov 2020 when people were fleeing NK and I believe next they have to do the same unless they want to live in Azerbaijan.

8/16/2023,Pure disbelief,"Hello Armenians:

I am compelled to post on this here to get it off my chest, especially since I also posted on the Azerbaijan subreddit page. As an outsider looking in, I was fascinated by the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict's origins, especially because it's considered the longest-running territorial conflict of the Soviet era.

In following the conflict and doing as much research as possible to see which side was right, I found Azerbaijan's position on territorial integrity was more compelling, as their proposal appeared to be the middle-of-the-road option by offering the local Armenian population through offers of autonomy. Perhaps that would have been strengthened with direct commercial relations with one another.

Needless to say: my opinion has changed since the 2020 conflict.

Like many of you, I have been reading up on some of the happenings in the South Caucasus, and I am in shock. My heart goes out to those suffering under the blockade. The alternate universe that many Azerbaijanis live in -- especially since I posted in their reddit and witnessed it myself -- is just astonishing. You can compel them with all of the evidence in the world, and yet they will deny or perform endless mental gymnastics about how a blockaded population is not starving because a small portion of the population supposedly has access to small amounts of food or Syrian mercenaries were not involved in fighting despite the countless documented geotags linking them directly to the warzone.

What is most striking is the sheer dehumanization they seem to have for Armenians altogether. The collectivization of Armenians ascribing negative traits and deserving the cruelest forms of punishment is disturbing.

**I do not believe Azerbaijan or Azerbaijani society is willing or capable of hosting Armenians in their country without risking their livelihood.**

Nothing has convinced me of this more than **talking** to Azerbaijanis, who are so consumed by their hatred that they don't even blink at casually talking about ethnically cleansing people as ""an internal state matter."" I was sent a page on Facebook about the supposed moral dilemma of Azerbaijanis talking about killing an Armenian baby, and my jaw dropped. I understand that many in that country had their lives uprooted by war, but the same happened on the other side, and I have yet to see Armenians become consumed by venom to the extent that they have. I am just in pure disbelief, and I have never seen so much vitriol coming from a country in my life. It makes the Serbs and Kosovars look like the best of friends.

And on top of that, the rhetoric coming from that country about how all of Armenia is ""illegitimate"" and actually ""belongs"" to Azerbaijan points to the fact that this is by no means a territorial conflict but an ethnic one in which one side wants to eliminate the other. I am inclined to think that this was the case from the beginning, and had they been able to achieve this outcome in the 90s, they would have.

I realize how maddening it can be to deal with this situation, especially when talking to the other side directly. I wanted to let at least you all know that you are seen, and I sincerely apologize for not doing my due diligence in the historical violence that has plagued this conflict. While I am still more inclined to support the territorial integrity of nations, this case is different because of the existential, zero-sum game Azerbaijan has adopted.

10/10/2021,"I believe that the hostility between Iran and Azerbaijan is the failure of the mullah regime, change my mind","This post might be downvoted, but I want to state that I have always saw myself as Iranian and Azerbaijani, but my utter hate towards the islamic republic and the head of the regime is increasing day by day for all of this. 

Let me explain how this all started:

Closer to the end of Soviet Union, the Azerbaijani identity was forming: people started to celebrate Nowruz again, Islam was again becoming prevalent, etc. Of course, I agree that the Soviets managed to separate Azerbaijani identity from Iran, Azerbaijanis saw themselves as turks like in Central Asian republics, but  Azerbaijanis never felt hostility towards Iran, Persians and other ethnic groups, ofc except Armenians after the war. 

As the Soviet Union collapsed, Azerbaijani Republic became independent with bunch of problems, such as the chaotic political instability combined with the economic collapse and loss of territories in the Nagorno-Karabakh. You might say that okay, Iran did not have any obligation to protect or help Azerbaijan at the time, and Iran tried to create a ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1992, 7 May, known as the [Tehran Communique](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_Communiqu%C3%A9), Azerbaijani side stopped the fighting, but Armenia broke the ceasefire and occupied the most important city of Shusha 1 day after this agreement. Iran did nothing and got blamed for it, because indirectly causing the loss of city, and resulting in the skeptical views on Iran. And during the course of the war and difficulties in Azerbaijan, Iran did nothing to help. 

By providing small military and financial aid to Azerbaijan,  and supporting some Pro-Iran/Pan-Iranist groups, Iran could actually become the ally of Azerbaijan and probably the ""one nation, two states"" concept would be applicable to Iran and Azerbaijan nowadays, not Turkey. 

Now Azerbaijan is blamed for being an ally of ""zionists, westerns etc"". Iran abandoned its former territories to political instability and to the occupation of baby killer christians who occupied and kicked out 600K refugees. Azerbaijan of course, had to look for the west to rebuild their country and buy military equipment. 

So, people who disagree, ""we sold our soul to Zionists"", Now tell me, doesn't it make sense that we have to protect ourselves from a revanchist christians and the large mullah regime which support them? Of course we have to find an ally to receive training and supplies, if we have threats in our border. Also, I don't get the ""zionists"" talk and conspiracies, I am sorry.

I feel like Pahlavi regime would not do this mistake, because they were nationalists, risking losing Azerbaijan to Armenia was a bad idea. 

I would like this discussion to continue, so, feel free to reply!


UPDATE:

Also, Iran has been trading with not just the Republic of Armenia, but with the unrecognized occupied territories of Azerbaijan, which i feel like is huge betrayal, and a acceptable cause for anger imo."

It frustrates me to no fucking end that western trans men even try to equate their experiences to ours or say that they’re “going down our way”. It is insulting, out of touch. 

every time I mention my experience to groups in this country they constantly try to equate or compare things. 

i am not saying the American or western system is perfect, it could be a lot better, but I feel like most of those communities are so extremely out of touch to what aggressive governments and societies can really be

so, basically, telling trans men from extremely hostile countries that your experiences as a western, first world trans man are in any way similar is insulting and out of touch, it’s pissing me off and alienating others from the community 

that’s it, i really just needed to rant about it and I kinda think it’s an issue to discuss"

Intending to take advantage of the situation, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed a Declaration on Allied Cooperation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On July 18, Aliyev also signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Strategic Partnership in the field of energy with the European Commission. The political and energy significance of the republic increased. Europe's elite supported the strengthening of Azerbaijani-Ukrainian ties.

In July 2022, the Iraqi telegram channel Sabereen News published secret documents showing that on April 4, 2022, Azerbaijan supplied aerial bombs to Ukraine. The documents state that arms were delivered through Sudan and Poland. By tracking the cargo numbers and examining the delivery notes signed by the Ukrainian company Meridian, affiliated with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the Industrial Association (an organization operating under the Ministry of Defense Industry of Azerbaijan), we can conclude that the bombs were used by Ukrainian Su-24 bombers against Russian troops. The Meridian company is also involved in the supply of Turkish drones to Azerbaijan during the 44-day war.

Even before the war in Urkaine, at least 3 Azerbaijani MiG-29 fighter jets were handed over to Kyiv, repaired and repainted in the camouflage of the Ukrainian Air Force at the Lviv State Aircraft Repair Plant. MiG-29 fighter jets took part in the hostilities in Karabakh.

It is worth noting that on July 29, the Africa Intelligence news agency presented details of the investigation confirming the information of the Iraqi Telegram channel.

On August 3, 2022, the Civilnet published a comprehensive report on the arms trade between Baku and Kyiv. According to it, the industrial company CIHAZ supplied bombs to the state company Ukrspetsexport, that has been involved in corruption scandals more than once. According to the documents, the delivery was to be carried out by the Meridian along the route between Khartoum (the capital of Sudan) and Rzeszow (Poland).

In March 2022, The Wall Street Journal, Economist and Time noted that Rzeszow, located just 60 km from the border of Ukraine, become a major center for the supply of weapons that were transferred by NATO countries.

Documents published by Civilnet also mention 32 QFAB-250LG precision bombs for Su-25 aircraft, each weighing 270 kg, developed by the Turkish defense corporation Aselsan complied with NATO standards."

9/21/2022,Azerbaijani embassy in France reveals new details of recent attack by Armenian radicals,"**BAKU, Azerbaijan, September 21.** New details of the provocation committed by a group of representatives of the Armenian community of France before the Azerbaijani embassy in Paris have been disclosed, [Trend](http://e/) reports via Anadolu.

Correspondents of Anadolu talked with the staff of the diplomatic mission of Azerbaijan in Paris, having learned about the events of the day when the incident took place.

The third secretary and media attache of the Azerbaijani embassy in Paris Gunel Zulfugarova said that the attack by radical representatives of the Armenian community on the diplomatic mission took place at nearly 14:10 (GMT +2) on September 18.

According to Zulfugarova, the number of participants in the provocation reached 40-50 people. Some of them tried to hang photographs of the presidents of Türkiye and Azerbaijan from the embassy building and demonstratively burn them.

""Then they started chanting slogans against Azerbaijan. The Armenians attacked the embassy building and threw eggs at it,"" she noted.

Then, according to the diplomat, the provocation participants started kicking the doors of the diplomatic mission.

""Three or four people tried to kick down the embassy door,"" she said.

The police arrived only 30-40 minutes after we received a call. Before the police arrived, the situation only worsened, Zulfugarova pointed out.

The Azerbaijani side has filed an application to determine the amount of damage to the building.

""When the investigation is completed, we'll begin the legal process for damages,"" she further said.

The diplomat also reminded that representatives of the Armenian community of France repeatedly attacked the Azerbaijani embassy and the Azerbaijani cultural center, causing damage.

Zulfugarova stated that since the attack took place on Sunday, there were employees on duty in the building.

Since they were able to prevent the attackers from entering the diplomatic mission building, no one was hurt, she added.

The first adviser to the embassy Ali Khalafli ​​said that the security guard of the diplomatic mission alone prevented the Armenians from intruding into the building, despite that they broke down the locks.

""We have previously demanded from the relevant institutions to ensure the security of the embassy building, but they considered that there were no sufficient grounds for this,"" Khalafli said.

According to him, the attackers partially burned photographs of Azerbaijani and Turkish presidents and shouted hostile slogans against Azerbaijan.

The diplomat also said that after the arrival of the police, the demonstration continued more calmly, and then the participants dispersed.

""The incident totally lasted about 50 minutes. After the incident, the police realized the seriousness of the situation and is now on guard here,"" Khalafli noted.

He further said that the Armenians of France repeatedly tried to organize provocations by burning the flags of Türkiye and Azerbaijan.

On the building of the diplomatic mission, there can be seen traces of eggs, and in front of the building on the street, there is a shell.

A police car is on duty in front of the embassy, ​​police officers check the IDs of persons approaching the building.

On September 18, representatives of the Armenian community in France attacked the Azerbaijani embassy.

Azerbaijani Ambassador to France Rahman Mustafayev, commenting on the attack video on Twitter, said that the French authorities not only don’t protect but also ignore reasonable requests for the safety of the diplomatic mission employees.

9/20/2023,Question to the Armenians.,"Hello friends, Indian here. First of all, I pray to God to give strength and determination to the Armenian nation in these times of struggle and the genocidal aggression shown by the Azeri regime. Hayastan will pull through, your brave people always have.

I wanted to ask this question, I don't know if this is the right place or the right time, and I'm deeply sorry if anyone gets offended by it. 

I wanted to know what Armenians think about leaving the Russian sphere of influence and siding with NATO will result in. I've seen many posts here condemning Russia in it's role in Artsakh and it's behaviour towards Armenia. What do you think will be the consequences of such steps, do you think it will do Armenia any good?"
11/15/2020,"I am heartbroken that Artsakh was left to Azerbaijan, honestly it breaks my heart to see Armenians burning their own homes this time before having to uproot and leave again. But I am also so disappointed... How could the resistance against such a historic hostility end in only 6 weeks?","As a Kurd, I know what it means to be in a situation of having to constantly flee Turkish aggression, and that is exactly what this war was. Azerbaijan's warplanes were even being coordinated from Turkish borders, no one can claim that this war was between Azerbaijan and Armenia. It was unfair, absolutely, it was hard and unforgiving yes. But it should not have ended so soon, I'm not talking about winning self-defense, I'm talking about fighting with everything you have for the motherland. No matter what the consequences are. This is patriotism. It isn't impossible either, the guerrillas in my country have been fighting the Turkish state for 45 years. I expected better, I'm sure the people of Armenia did too. Sorry for your loss, I truly am."

12/14/2020,"Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan: ""Four servicemen were detained on charges of insulting the bodies of Armenian servicemen and Armenian gravestones""","The courage, professionalism and professionalism of the Azerbaijani Army in the Patriotic War for the liberation of the territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the restoration of its territorial integrity led to a victory engraved in golden letters in history.

Numerous servicemen of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan have been awarded by the Orders of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan for their heroism and bravery in the performance of combat missions.

The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Mr. Ilham Aliyev, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, despite the fact that the civilian population of Azerbaijan has been attacked by Armenia since the first day of counter-offensive operations to liberate the occupied territories, instructed to adhere to the norms and principles of international humanitarian law, including the requirements of the Geneva Conventions. Guided by the instructions of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the soldiers and officers of the Azerbaijani Army treated the civilian population, including women, children and the elderly, captured servicemen and clergymen with great care and care during the liberation of our lands. The attitude was widely covered through their meetings with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and interviews with local and media outlets.

It is unfortunate that under the influence of the severe psychological state of war, the mistakes of some servicemen in understanding the methods and techniques of fighting the enemy have led to the courage and crushing of the Armed Forces, as well as illegal actions that could overshadow the victory.

Thus, the Prosecutor General's Office and the Military Prosecutor's Office analyzed videos released on some media and social media pages showing Azerbaijani servicemen insulting the bodies of Armenian servicemen killed during hostilities, as well as inhumane treatment of captured Armenian servicemen. Although some of the videos were found to be fake, there were serious doubts as to whether they were true or not.

In addition to the information previously provided to the press, we would like to inform you that on the basis of the materials collected in connection with the above-mentioned information, the Military Prosecutor's Office Intensive investigative measures were taken on the case.

Rashad Aliyev and Gardashkhan Abishov, serving as junior sergeants in the ""N"" military unit of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan, were charged with insulting the bodies of Armenian servicemen killed during hostilities in Zangilan region. reasonable suspicions have been identified that they were sent to individuals.

The investigation also revealed that soldiers of the ""N"" military unit of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan Arzu Huseynov and Umid Agayev committed insulting acts by destroying Armenian gravestones in the cemetery in Madatli village of Khojavend region, videotaped their actions on a smartphone and shared them on social networks. The grounds for suspicion of sending were identified.

R.Aliyev, G.Abishov, A.Huseynov and U.Agayev were involved in the case under the relevant articles of the Criminal Code and were remanded in custody.

Necessary research will be conducted on other videos spread on social media and the public will be provided with detailed information about the results.

The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan declares that the above-mentioned criminal acts committed by the servicemen of the Republic of Azerbaijan are inadmissible and contradict the mentality of the Azerbaijani people, which is tolerant, multicultural and historically humane. Persons who have committed similar violations will be brought to justice by taking measures provided by law.

It should be noted that the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan has taken necessary and intensive measures on insulting the bodies of Azerbaijani servicemen killed during hostilities, videos of inhumane treatment of captured Azerbaijani servicemen, and all crimes related to the killing and injury of Azerbaijani civilians. investigative actions are underway. The Prosecutor General's Office will take all possible measures to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice within the existing legal mechanism and international law.

9/21/2023,Visited Azerbaijan and missed a connecting flight,"I think this has to be up their with the strangest dreams I've ever had. Recall was kinda weird too. I just came across something in the news about this region of the world and it made me remember the dream / nightmare. Otherwise I'm pretty sure I would have completely forgotten about this in my conscious mind. 

In the dream:

I took a flight to Azerbaijan. I have never been to Azerbaijan in real life. In fact, I barely know anything about the country. Although I met a friend who's involved in stuff to do with Armenia recently so I probably heard a lot about the place that planted the seed.

The dream involved landing there on a commercial flight. My wife was on the flight (in the dream). I remember seeing the national flag near the runway and feeling psyched to visit a country I haven't been in before ... as that's something that I rarely do (business travel tends to take me to the same few places repetitively). There was a feeling of excitement, optimism.

In the dream we were connecting to Japan (whether this itinerary makes any real world sense I have no idea!). That part makes sense as Japan is currently my top dream travel destination. I was overwhelmed by excitement. Not only was I visiting a new country, but I was on my way to another one!

I went shopping in the airport and realized that I needed to buy a tripod because .. I guess the trip in my dream was somehow also work-related (I do videography stuff in real life). I remember feeling stressed about time and trying to shake off an officious shop attendant. I remember the price of the tripod being really extortionate. 

The layover was apparently long enough that I had enough time to leave the airport. So in the dream, I took some kind of local train to the most mesmerising landscape you can imagine filled with steep hills and smiling locals picnicking on them while we both basked in the beautiful view. It was a magic, surreal place.

I reluctantly took the train back to the airport to make my connecting flight but ended up getting off at the wrong stop and missing the airport. I tried to get back into the airport through some side entrance but the security was so arduous (I recall there being three checkpoints) that by the time I finally made it through I had missed my flight to Japan. I kept going through one security checkpoint after the other and wondering why there were so many ... but the security people and the locals were both really hostile. 

I then remembered feeling like I was trapped in Azerbaijan and - in the tapestry of feelings in the dream - the country then took on a very evil, menacing vibe.... oppressive, dark, a dictatorship. A sinking feeling set in that this was where I had to spend the rest of my life, living in this misery.

Any interpretations welcome. It was wacky!

(Final detail: I looked up the national flag of Azerbaijan and this is definitely the flag I saw in my dream. I also remember specifically remembering - in the dream - being in Azerbaijan. So weird!)"

Azeri-Armenian hostilities began during WW1, Russian Civil War, and the Armenian genocide. Lots of massacres, genocide, and ethnic cleansing. Armenians see Azeris are just Turks. (Many Turks feel the same way) Tensions were stomped out by the totalitarian Soviet regime after its establishment. After the Soviet union disappeared, ethnic hostilities resumed. Stalin also conducted a massive amount of border shifting and changing during this time period, basically ruining regional stability in the Caucasus. Anyways, all this hostility culminated into this:

Large-scale military conflict after Soviet dissolution over a small autonomous republic populated by ethnic Armenians. Decisivie Armenian victory, Azerbaijan suffered a humiliating defeat with heavy losses despite their numerical superiority in regards to arms, aircraft and personnel. Became frozen conflict, clashes on border ever since. Its been escalating since 2014.

Artsakh (Armenian name for Karabakh) is strategically important for Armenia. This region prevents the Armenian region of Syunik from being sandwiched by Azerbaijan, who claims the region (and most of Armenia) and its historic territories.  

Most Armenians know about this quote, but to shed some light on the strategic importance of this region...

>""If we lose Karabakh, we turn the final page of our people's history."" - Monte Melkonian, Armenian national hero

**The clashes going on in the border regions are combined arms in nature, this is the closest both countries have been to all out war in 25 years.**


----------

Azerbaijani military launched a few small scale combined arms offensives near Martakert and somewhere in the southern border regions. They managed to make around 5 gains, 3 of them being reversed by the Armenians.

*""Officially""* around 12 Azeri troops and 18 Armenian troops have been killed. Azerbaijanis had one Mi-24 helicopter gun ship shot down, along with one tank being blown up. Armenians so far have lost an undisclosed number of tanks, so have the Azerbaijanis although this hasnt been fully confirmed yet. Most civilian causulties so far are Armenian. Azeris entered a village near Talish, and executed three elderly ethnic Armenians. Cut their ears off. One Armenian soldier (idk if he was dead or alive when it happened) was beheaded by Azeris and paraded in front of some civis. One 12 year old Armenian boy killed in shelling.

>Something you guys need to keep in mind: Both MoDs LIE ALOT about their causalities and number kills inflicted upon the enemy. Beware of the propaganda. Id say the Azeris tend to exaggerate alot more than the Armenian MoD. (At least initially. Video footage suggests that dozens more Azeri troops have been killed. Special forces unit was decimated near Talish apparently.)

* ~~Reports already rolling in of a crumbling ceasefire. Both sides blaming each other, yet to be confirmed.~~ 

Ceasefire IS holding apparently. 

* Talish is confirmed to be fully under Armenian control. As I predicted in other thread, Azerbaijanis still control the frontline positions (that they overwhelmed during the initial assault) on the mountains surrounding the village.

>Im Armenian and I have been following this conflict since I could remember. Feel free to ask me questions, Ill try and answer them as objectively as I can. Feel free to correct some of the information about the recent territorial changes, Im not fully updated on those and the reports coming in are very confusing 

 
IMHO, War has restarted. No more clashes. This is all out war being waged by Azerbaijan in the Karabakh region. If it spreads to Tavush (Armenian northern region) expect Russia to invade Azerbaijan. If it spreads to Nakchivan expect Turkey to get involved. (Its their only border with Azerbaijan and can easily be overrun by Armenian Armed Forces)

>First of all, we were told that the evacuation of people from Aghavno, Berdzor, Sus is not the demand of the Azerbaijani side, Azerbaijan is ready to accept that the approximately 350 Armenian residents living in this area will continue to live in their settlements, provided that they become citizens of Azerbaijan and live according to the laws of Azerbaijan. So, for example, the residents of the isolated Armenian villages remaining in the territory of Cilicia live in Turkey. In other words, having in mind that they live in the territory of a hostile state and obeying the authorities and laws of that state.

3/22/2022,[Diplomacy] You’re Telling Me a Trans Person Built this Pipeline?," 

Europe needs to import natural gas to heat itself but it also wants to dramatically reduce the import of Russian natural gas. Azerbaijan has helped fill the demand for some of this new need already by piping natural gas to Europe but it alone cannot fill all of that demand. This leaves Europe other choices, but those sometimes go through Iran, another potentially troublesome route in times of chaos. Fortunately for Europe, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan have a solution to their woes: the Trans-Caspian Natural Gas Pipeline. This pipeline, running from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan, will connect Kazakhstani and Turkmenistan natural gas fields and networks to the multitude of pipelines in Azerbaijan that go to Georgia and Turkey and then onwards to Europe, all while avoiding Iran, Iraq, Russia, Syria, or any nations prone to instability or hostile reactions to the West. Once completed the pipeline will have a maximum discharge of 30 bn cubic meters. The pipeline, at a length of roughly 300km, is estimated to cost 5 billion dollars and will take 3 years to complete. It will connect well with the Southern Gas Corridor, a European Project. This is a great way for Europe to reduce its natural gas prices upon completion, reduce Chinese influence in the region by promoting European infrastructure, and reduce dependence on Russian and Iranian natural gas. 

Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan have both agreed upon this project however there is something holding this up: Russia and Iran. Both claim that any projects in the Caspian Sea require the consent of all countries that border the Caspian Sea because they claim that a treaty signed by the Soviet Union and Iran is still in effect, requiring all states to consent. This is clearly ridiculous as the Soviet Union no longer exists and letting Russia and Iran deny access to sea infrastructure for all members is unfair and unenforceable by those two. Still, Azerbaijan would like for the European Union to publicly support the legal right of Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan to build this pipeline, which is critical to help Europe’s economy and strategic situation, along with standing up to Russian aggression, who are too busy to do anything realistic to stop this pipeline construction. Azerbaijan will also ask Turkey for public support of this project as they are close allies and some of the new gas will likely flow into existing pipelines to Turkey. Other existing pipelines will flow to Georgia, so Azerbaijan will also ask Georgia for its public support of this project, another way to defeat Russian imperialism. 

Azerbaijan would also like to invite European and Turkish companies and governments to invest in this project as it is a great way to profit off of likely increasing natural gas usage as Europe weans off coal and needs other natural gas sources. Azerbaijan has also undertaken many reforms to make itself a better environment for foreign and domestic businesses, so European companies do not need to worry about difficulty conducting business with the now 25th globally ranked country in ease of doing business. Azerbaijan will help any interested companies get established and participate and believes this can be a very mutually beneficial situation. 

Azerbaijan will determine how much it can fund based upon the interest of investors. If enough funding and support are received, Azerbaijan is ready to approve and begin this project immediately."

Is this hostility a recent development, or is there a deeper history of conflict between Iran/Azerbaijan pre-dating the current situation?"
5/3/2023,"The opposition leader, chairperson of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (APFP) Ali Karimli: “Whichever way you look at it, a group of people who rule the country is the winner of this Formula 1 game…”","***“Whichever way you look at it, a group of people who rule the country is the winner of this Formula 1 game…”***

**(Lack of) Human Rights and Liberties** 

According to the lawyer Nemat Karimli, Prosecutor General Kamran Aliyev will personally supervise the criminal case against the member of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (APFP) Alizamin Salayev, who has been on hunger strike for more than 80 days. The representatives of the Investigation Control Department of the Police Bodies of the Prosecutor General’s Office met with Salayev in the detention center to inform him about the new development.

The Chairperson of the APFP Ali Karimli said that Salayev should be released immediately and hospitalized; otherwise, it won’t be possible to save him. Karimli: “[This information gives a little hope that there are people in the government who](https://www.facebook.com/karimliali/posts/pfbid0AqSRKdPLQrqzRF9SCjxSVLHTZEJnRaogyK5qDUKiNqqw1LaXeZWv1sGnUXAkHfzdl) understand the tragic consequences of the killing of Alizamin Salayev in this way. If the authorities really don’t want to be Alizamin Salayev‘s murderer, they should be quick. Alizamin Salayev, who is on the 84th day of hunger, may die at any moment. No one knows how many more days Salayev can endure.”

Azadlig Newspaper reports that a person named Rafael Bayramov was taken to the Ministry of Internal Affairs by civilian police and was threatened that he would be arrested on drug charges if he did not pay them 5000 manats. Bayramov was beaten by the police officers and was released hours later, only after one of his friends paid the requested 5000 manats. Bayramov later shared a social media post denying that he was beaten up and asked everyone to delete his previous post about the incident. Human Rights defenders argued that Bayramov was threatened by the police for publicizing what happened to him, and therefore, he had to deny his previous post.

**Governance and Corruption** 

Formula 1 ® confirmed that the Azerbaijan Grand Prix will remain on the calendar until 2026 following the renewal of the contract with Azerbaijan. ” Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said that “the Baku City Circuit has become a hugely popular venue for Formula 1, and they are delighted to extend our relationship with the country of Azerbaijan and look forward to continuing our growth together.”

However, the residents of Baku have continuously complained about the paralyzed traffic, deafening noise, and restraints of movement in the center of the capital city due to the international race that Baku hosts every year since 2016.

Chairperson of APFP Ali Karimli commented on the renewal of the contract, saying that the Formula 1 game only serves the interests of the ruling family while the local population pays the price. Karimli: “[This decision of the regime is a demonstrative example of](https://www.facebook.com/karimliali/posts/pfbid02Xg4hcPaZtRJHBJRRorGAi7rg6QNvqUn6Sha6x4zmdzpoS2LaHE6gorxcKGdCcuu4l) disrespecting the people. The ruling family and the oligarchs around them earn a lot every year from these games, which causes a lot of pain to the residents of Baku. Tens of thousands of rich and middle-class “Formula-1” fans pay for expensive plane tickets, hotels, restaurants, banks, communication, insurance, and transportation companies belonging to the ruling family. Moreover, in preparation for Formula 1, they embezzle a huge amount of public funding yearly with various excuses. In other words, whichever way you look at it, only a group of people who run the country are the winners of these games. The rich increase their money as a result of this game, while ordinary hardworking people suffer year after year. Due to Formula 1, there has been a terrible traffic jam in Baku for several weeks. The routine of the residents is disturbed. Moreover, there is terrible noise in the city center, the historical monuments of Baku are damaged, and it is too costly for the state budget. At every opportunity, the regime shows us that it does not take into account public opinion and the wishes of the people. They abuse the tolerance of our people. Unfortunately, since we are so tolerant and patient, they will continue to conduct many of such experiments on us.”

Chairperson of the Azerbaijan Democracy and Welfare Party (ADWP) Gubad Ibadoghlu said that the Azerbaijani government paid the record amount of $ 57 million to hist the grand prix.  Ibadoghlu: “[Azerbaijan was the 1st among 23 countries to pay the maximum amount – 57 million US dollars – to host the Formula](https://www.facebook.com/gubad.ibadoglu/posts/pfbid02grTtDdYyXY5PWBknWKomT7gyFswNWrDJKYjyjDbbHS4ebT7ZKpTn9wRJKUazvDr6l) 1 race. In order to host the Formula 1 game in 2023, 1 country paid an average of 37 million dollars, while Azerbaijan paid the maximum amount of 57 million dollars among 23 countries. Saudi Arabia and Qatar paid the most – 55 million US dollars – to host this competition. The government that has been paying 80 manats per month to war veterans for four years has taken over the oil and gas revenues to humiliate its own people by paying the highest amount to host the Formula 1 Grand Prix. This is how they eat the share of those who do not eat.”

Member of the National Council of Democratic Forces (NCDF) Tofig Yagublu said that the regime demonstrates hostility and disrespect towards the citizens by violating their constitutional rights. Yagublu: “[This is “hostility” and “unethical”.](https://www.facebook.com/tofiq.yaqublu/posts/pfbid0inBpJBYagcKy6KJaTsUshRGLQiXVnkpeUFjKdKgFmSkYLHvgjMzdtmjiBwRUtYnbl)  The government prohibits the freedom of free assembly of citizens provided by the Constitution of the country under the pretext of “obstructing the movement of pedestrians and cars”. But despite the strong objections of the citizens, it continues to hold Formula 1 races in the center of Baku for years, which seriously hinders the movement of pedestrians and cars while there is no legal obligation or necessity to be held in our country.”

Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeyhun Bayramov praised the role of the United States in the negotiations with Armenia. The minister thanked the USA and said that as a result of Washington’s efforts, Armenia returned to the negotiation process. Meanwhile, in the information released by the US State Department, Secretary of State Blinken said that in his conversation with Ilham Aliyev, he took into account that “the risk of a humanitarian crisis in the Lachin Corridor undermines the prospect of peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia.”

Member of the APFP Fuad Gahramanli shared his opinion on the statement of the State Department, saying that the situation of human rights in Azerbaijan is also one of the priorities. “[As it can be seen in the statement, the USA, unlike Russia, does not demand](https://www.facebook.com/fuad.gahramanli.54/posts/pfbid0xmQCe4ziHukMQaDmCi4oYLt9A4byN9rEWU35wsXbmXHWZFsc7maM4F1dMBj7pxVal) the removal of the checkpoint set up by Azerbaijan at the border. Therefore, in order to achieve peace, Azerbaijan is asked not to use this border crossing point to create a humanitarian crisis. The US wants to get a guarantee that conditions will be created for “people’s movement and commercial activity” in the Lachin corridor after the operation of the Azerbaijani border control and that there will be no danger of any humanitarian crisis. This guarantee is considered a necessary condition for the Armenian side to agree to a peace treaty. In a telephone conversation, Ilham Aliyev said that this post was established to prevent the use of the Lachin corridor for military purposes and that there was no risk of a humanitarian crisis. Another interesting point is that the State Department stated that Blinken also discussed human rights problems in Azerbaijan during his conversation with Ilham Aliyev. However, the Azerbaijani media purposefully ignored this aspect of the telephone conversation. Blinken’s insistence on this issue shows that despite the security issues on the agenda, the United States is paying attention to the increasingly serious problems in the field of human rights in Azerbaijan. It has become a tradition to discuss issues related to human rights and democratic freedoms, and by doing so, the United States shows that democratic values in the relations between the two countries are as important as national security.”"

The warring parties, mediated by Russia, reached an agreement on a systemic truce. The agreement will pave the way for the preparation of the Grand Political Agreement.

According to haqqin.az, Armenia undertakes obligations to withdraw the occupied troops from the Kelbajar, Lachin and Aghdam regions. In addition, Azerbaijan retains its combat positions won during active hostilities, including the city of Shusha.

Azerbaijan and Armenia agreed to deploy Russian peacekeeping forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. According to a preliminary agreement, Russian troops will act as a cordon of demarcation between the opposing forces. Along with this, the parties agreed on the active participation of the Turkish government in the final settlement of the Karabakh problem.

The final status of Nagorno-Karabakh within the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan will be determined during further negotiations.

In the early morning of November 10, the defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia will arrive in Moscow to discuss the details of the systemic ceasefire"

Thoughts?"
6/1/2023,How much do voting blocs affect the final result?,"We all have seen it happen: countries voting for their neighbours or other friendly countries. We've seen Greece and Cyprus give eachother 12 points, Romania and Moldova do the same, the Nordic countries do the same, in the past we had Turkey and Azerbaijan do the same and several Baltic countries vote for Russia. We've also seen countries vote for artists that are from there even if they participate a different country. Plus there is also the diaspora voting. We've also seen the opposite, of course. Countries refusing to give points to more hostile countries (notable examples include Albania and Serbia, Armenia and Azerbaijan). The public tends to be a bit more biased towards neighbours and friendly countries but even juries do so sometimes (don't forget that the Greek jury giving a 4 to Cyprus was a huge surprise and people talked about it quite a lot because they expected the Greek jury to give them a 12 as usual).

So I have 2 questions:

The main question is, as the title says, how much do voting blocs and similar patterns affect the result. Regarding winners in the last few years at least I can't remember anyone winning just because of that. The only exception I can think of is Ukraine in 2022 and their record-breaking televoting result, but that was an extreme situation where a good song (at least I liked it, definitely on my top 5 from 2022) got a massive support due to the war. It sure can have an effect in lower positions, but I'm just curious to see how much it truly affects the results.

The other question is whether voting blocs can be explained in other ways as well. For example, Eleni Foureira has been a huge name in Greece (she is based in Greece after all) even before she represented Cyprus in Eurovision. People love her music and they loved Fuego, so she'd probably get our 12 points no matter which country she represented. Neighbouring countries tend to have similar music styles as well so it would make sense to vote for a song of a neighbour if they like it of if they know the artist. Albania's song this year for example sounded so familiar to me because its style is similar to several Greek artists' style, so I liked it a bit.

It might sound like I'm defending voting blocs. I am not. I don't like them at all. I just wanna see if it's a pure ""black or white"" situation where people vote for their friends or if there's more to it. And since people talk about them each year saying this is why juries should exist (I do believe so, but they need reforms and more transparency, that's a different story though) so I wanna see how much it truly affects the results."
10/2/2020,Drones and the Second Nagorno Karabakh War,"Besides our perpetual Culture War there is a real war going on. Warning: war footage in links but no gore.

Armenia and Azerbaijan are fighting what is the first all out war between reasonably well equipped states in decades. 

In the 90's  [armenian forces took](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) the disputed Nagorno Karabakh autonomous region, populated by armenians but made part of the Azerbaijan soviet republic by Stalin, and some nearby areas that were populated by ethnic azeris before the war.

The internationally unrecognized  [Republic of Artsakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) controls this land with massive support from Armenia proper and has strongly fortified it. Russia is allied with Armenia and provides them with weapons. The morale is high as armenians believe that they will suffer another ethnic cleansing and/or genocide if they lose and they are probably right given [the Safarov case.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramil_Safarov)

Azerbaijan wants Nagorno Karabakh back and being an oil-producing state has much more money then Armenia to put into weapons. And it paid off.

Since the beginning of the war azeris posted lots of footage of their drones [(UAV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle) hitting the armenians hard.

For example [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcZOCfCkt_I) shows them hitting frontline air defence systems. There are lots of other videos on /r/CombatFootage showing drones attacking at least [a dozen T-72 tanks, artillery, MLRS, ICV, trucks, infantry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDUncGw_54E) and even [cities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESyiaVrqIyE). 

The main culprit is the turkish [Bayraktar TB-2](https://imgur.com/h86uiiC) drone. Turkey is supporting Azerbaijan due to linguistic and cultural ties and also oil. Turkey has an old grudge against armenians and Erdogan is ramping up turkish nationalism for political reasons so they will keep supplying Azerbaijan with how many drones and ammunition they need. It is rumored that the drone operators of Azerbaijan are in fact experienced turkish officers that have already used TB-2 in anger in Kurdistan, Syria and Libya wars. Turkey is also rumored to have recruited fighters from Syria in the last month and sent them to the NK war and there are supposedly frictions between the islamist fighters and azeri civilians which are shia and usually less religious than Middle Eastern muslims. But there are many rumors on the internet about this war, so take them with a grain of salt.

Another effective type of drone are [israeli kamikaze drones,](https://twitter.com/TSKMap/status/1311229071200858112) also called [loitering munition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Harop) which is kind of a funny name, unless you are killed by them like the poor souls [in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUzCm40wlDQ) Israel is another supporter of Azerbaijan because they both have hostile relations with Iran. When the Russian tzars occupied the Caucasus, they only took Northern Azerbaijan from Persia, which is now the independent Azerbaijan. South Azerbaijan is part of Iran and [azeris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Azerbaijanis) form 16% of iranians, so a strong azeri secessionist movement is a real danger for Iran. 

With this web of regional power interests there is a risk of the war spreading, but I'm not too worried. The alliance between Armenia and Russia covers only Armenia proper, not NK, and hopefully Erdogan is not that crazy to attack Armenia or the large russian base there. Russians sell weapons to both sides and despite being allied with Armenia have good relations with Azerbaijan.

The war looks brutal. Azeri drones have hit the armenians hard, but most [azeri ground attacks have been repulsed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hejuzmQ7tI4) with only modest territorial gains. Azeri hopes of an [Operation Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Storm) were dashed by  determined armenians soldiers entrenched in rough terrain, so the war looks like is becoming a war of attrition. If armenians don't find or recieve from a weapon system that can deal with drones they will suffer terrible losses until they will be unable to hold Nagorno-Karabakh and prevent the predictable ethnic cleansing of that region. 

The success of azeri drones will be a wake up call for armies across the world. Drones like TB-2 are small and can fly low so they are hard to detect by radar or hit with AA systems and when using them against frontline targets sending fighter planes against them is both difficult and risky as it puts the planes in range of enemy AA. Plus, drones are relatively cheap, don't result in human losses for operators and don't require large air bases as staging areas. 

Russian bases in Syria successfully resisted [surprise drone swarm attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmeimim_Air_Base#Drone_attacks), but they benefited from a strong concentration of AA assets and the drones were probably not sent by a strong military. 
Defending a country from a massive drone attack supported by electronic warfare, fighter jets, long-range AA missiles etc looks far more complicated.

A global arms race is going to start not only to equipp armed forces with drones but also in creating defence systems that can defend an entire army against them like effective anti-drone MANPADs, improved jamming, anti-drone drones, etc  

For now, light AA guns and AA machine guns might enjoy a return to armies inventories from which they were displaced by rockets while tanks look increasingly obsolete."
4/27/2023,"(Lack of) Human Rights and Liberties - Governance and Corruption - Regardless of how positive the Azerbaijani public considered it, the US Embassy in Azerbaijan, the French Foreign Ministry, and the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing their concerns about this development.","**“…”**

**(Lack of) Human Rights and Liberties** 

Member of Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (APFP) Alizamin Salyev has been on hunger strike for 77 days. Salayev’s Lawyer Nemet Karimli said that  Salayev would not stop the hunger strike unless he was released. “Zamin Bey (Alzamin) called from the detention center. His health has deteriorated. He said that he could no longer move, his weight dropped to 80 kg, and he suffers from pain and insomnia. He insists on continuing his hunger strike, and he will not accept false accusations against him.”

Anar Asadli, the chairperson of the Azerbaijan Yukselish Party, was arrested. Asadli is accused of massive fraud. Asadli’s lawyers have not commented yet.

**Governance and Corruption** 

Azerbaijan unilaterally established a border crossing point at the beginning of the Lachin-Khankendi road on the border with Armenia. According to the information released by the State Border Service, the goal is “to prevent the transportation of manpower, ammunition, mines, and other military equipment from Armenia to the illegal Armenian armed groups in the territory of Azerbaijan.” The command of the Russian peacekeeping contingent and the Russian-Turkish Monitoring Center was informed about this new development, the statement said.

Chairperson of  APFP Ali Karimli shared his opinion on the decision of the State Border Service, saying that the government should have taken this step long before: “[We have been insisting on setting up a checkpoint](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=243518591501769) on the Lachin-Khankendi road for several months. We explained in detail how to justify the decision on behalf of the government. Finally, they have done the right thing. If they heard us every time we suggested our opinion, the situation in the country would be much better. However, as Armenia has already set up a checkpoint on its side of the border, we have followed them by opening a checkpoint on our side of the border. However, no matter what the motive might be, the good news is that at last, we can control our borders.”

Chairperson of Azerbaijan Democracy and Welfare Party (ADWP) Gubad Ibadoghlu also commented on the new checkpoint on the border, adding that the Russian troops in the Karabakh region should withrow. “[I believe that ensuring the border](https://www.facebook.com/gubad.ibadoglu/posts/pfbid0EqHefYHrwnwt4S5tHC9rmHFJcS8iLb9zfEiyfCCmytAiUsRdzJbT1S2KAah2HLAcl) security of independent Azerbaijan based on the conditions agreed with the Russian “peacekeepers” is against the Constitution of Azerbaijan. It is not acceptable from the point of view of guaranteeing sovereignty, and it leads to the strengthening of Russia’s sphere of influence in Azerbaijan. Moreover, the long-term stay of Russian troops in Karabakh serves to hinder peace talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan and increases dependence on the Kremlin to regulate the process. Therefore, I consider the involvement of the Russian side to be an insidious and greedy plan of Russia, and I categorically condemn it. I suggest that the Russian-Turkish Joint Monitoring Center should be created in Aghdam, and Turkey should be represented at the border checkpoint in Lachin as soon as possible, or Russia should be excluded from this process.”

Member of the National Council of Democratic Forces (NFDC) Gultakin Hajibeyli argued that the new checkpoint would be effective in convincing the Armenians living in the region to accept Azerbaijani rule. “[Azerbaijan taking control of the Lachin](https://www.facebook.com/gultakinhajibayli/posts/pfbid02dCA3zzsPuKfnXiLfUP5MUDpFSAzTrKKvq11pWBoUbvPWeUhbhsc8bd5K9wAgz27Xl) road is the most effective signal for Karabakh Armenians: either you will integrate into Azerbaijan and become an ordinary citizen of the country, or you will have to find another country for yourself. The days when you relied on Russia and caused war, conflict, bloodshed, and genocide in Azerbaijan and the South Caucasus with the support of Russia’s oppression, support, and insidious policy have long gone.”

Member of the APFP Fuad Gahramanli was among those who applauded the opening of the border control, saying that “Azerbaijan’s opportunity to exercise control over Karabakh will create additional opportunities for exerting soft pressure on the separatist organization there and involving the Armenian community in negotiations in the direction of reintegration”. Gahramanli also added that for the long term, this new decision would benefit the Azerbaijani side to have more influence on the local population. “Whenever the Armenians transporting through Karabakh are inspected by the Azerbaijani border guards, this will have a very serious psychological effect and will make them accept that they are living in the territory of Azerbaijan. Thus, over time, they will understand that because they live in the territory of Azerbaijan, they have no possibility to go beyond the sovereignty of Azerbaijan. Under these conditions, the ability of the so-called group led by Araik to maintain the separatist mood among the Armenians in Karabakh will be significantly reduced.”

Regardless of how positive the Azerbaijani public considered it, the US Embassy in Azerbaijan, the French Foreign Ministry, and the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing their concerns about this development. The statement released by the US embassy in Azerbaijan states that “the United States is deeply concerned that Azerbaijan’s establishment of a checkpoint on the Lachin corridor undermines efforts to establish confidence in the peace process.” The US Department called for the restoration of free movement in the Lachin Corridor and “to resume peace talks and refrain from provocations and hostile actions along the border.”

The French Foreign Ministry called on Azerbaijan to “obey international norms and the decisions of the International Court of Justice. France said that this step of Azerbaijan contradicts the obligations taken under the ceasefire agreements and undermines the negotiation process.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia said in a statement that any unilateral steps that violate the main provisions of the tripartite statement of the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan are unacceptable. “The Russian side is ready to provide all the necessary assistance to Armenia and Azerbaijan both at the political level and “on the ground” – with the participation of the command of peacekeepers”, concluded the statement.

President Ilham Aliyev signed a decree reducing the number of settlements in the districts of the liberated territories in the Karabakh region. However,r the president’s decision met harsh criticism from the opposition as they argued that it was against the constitution to change the settlements without consulting with the local residents. According to Articles 13-2.1 of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan “on Territorial Structure and Administrative Territorial Division”, when administrative-territorial units are registered, merged, or changed their administrative subordination, when they are named or renamed, a meeting (meetings) is held to ensure that at least 25 percent of the citizens living in the territory of each territorial unit and who have the right to vote, and to express their opinion on the relevant issue. The law also states that, “When more than half of the citizens who participated in the meeting (meetings) vote “in favor” of registering, merging, changing the administrative subordination of the territorial unit, giving a name to the territorial unit or changing its name, the corresponding decision is adopted.”

Chairperson of the ADWP Gubad Ibadoghlu said that “[The Azerbaijani authorities, which d](https://www.facebook.com/gubad.ibadoglu/posts/pfbid0SDu9FUgaemCxZRbDaMK4NsSuUJQ9i4tKhxpRqK2kisFUnRMUhnixKQMfWmxHdvgJl)eclared that they are ready to discuss infrastructure and other issues with the Armenians of Karabakh, unfortunately do not show the same approach to the internally displaced persons, and there are no discussions with the Azerbaijanis about the unification of settlements or the restoration of property rights.

Member of the NCDF Tofig Yagublu said that “[Ilham Aliyev is causing more damage to the history of the nation](https://www.facebook.com/tofiq.yaqublu/posts/pfbid02qeMycmeoXmnATtGLxf6BRH4YwWDNCv8d7s7yUfaX76u79ze28793VkJSF2hmoNrVl) than the Armenians by arbitrarily liquidating the villages in the territories freed from occupation. “This action is an act of vandalism against the history and toponyms of our people. The idea of merging 4-5 villages under the name of one village is not only illegal but also stupid. Every village is a motherland! Those who cancel the homeland are its enemies!”

11/10/2020,The was in Nagorno-Karabakh is over,"After 45 days of bloodshed, the war is over. Armenia and Azerbaijan under the direction of Russia signed a pact ending the war, and also changing the dynamics in the region.

Azerbaijan keeps all territory they had captured during this 45 days war, plus, according to the deal, they will also be given the rest of the disputed territory, except nagorno-karabakh itself, which will remain under ""Artsakh"" administration. This is a big victory for Azerbaijan, since they saved their selfs war and soldiers for a pocket of territory which would demand the energy put for the first 45 days of war if not more, and they get it without using any energy. *But the biggest* losers here if one looks at the macro, are the *western imperialists*, and the *bigger victors* are *Russia and Turkey.*

Lets explain why. First, we need to consider the government of Armenia. The current government of Armenia which came to power after the ""velvet revolution"" started as a pro EU movement, before settling to something in between, meaning that they decided to start flirting both sides, Russia and EU. Of course, like history has chosen, flirting can only be a small intermediate stage. And this is proven yet again here. Russia of course cannot but hate this flirting.

One thing is obvius: The person who signed this deal of surrender, will be out of government soon, and along with everyone associated with him. It is only natural, once support from nationalists is over your days are numbered.

And what is better for Russia than having the people of Armenia ousting this flirting western comprador called Pashinyan? Already, 17 parties have signed a join letter demanding his government resignation. Here is an importand quote from the letter

>During this period, the government showed its obvious inability, inability to meet internal and external challenges. Human and territorial losses, incomplete relations with Armenia's allies and, first of all, with the Russian Federation, make the bankruptcy of the current government obvious.

What this means is that the opposition parties are accusing Pashinyan and his government of flirting with the west, thus jeopardising the nation's position in the globe. They correctly accuse him of taking the stable relations with Russia to a breaking point, and putting the country *from being in one camp, to being in between two camps*. A country between two camps would make the camp *farther* to the country hesitant to help it, especially when they are by half part of the enemy camp too, which is also *closer* to the country in question. The camp which has the country by half in its camp, and is also *closer* to the country, is eager to *end this two-camp situation*. This is what happened here. Russia wins the full partnership of the *new* government which will come. Hence, Russia will become stronger in the international arena. 

Here, we analysed  how and why the western imperialists lose on one side. Now lets see how Turkey wins, and how the western imperialists lose from this side too. As we have analysed previusly, the Turkish comprador bourgeoisie have become *too strong* to remain as the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie want them, *just a comprador*. They want to compete or be part of the camp in *equal terms* with the other majort states within the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie camp.

If this happens, the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie *lose greatly*, and one of these sub groups within it, *France*, and even some smaller compradors, *Greece*, dont want to see Turkey arising so much. It is their greatest fear. France will have a *competitor* in the middle east and in the sahel too. This means smaller *profits* for the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie to *spread* to their *labour aristocratic* *masses*, and seeing how france politics are now also *dominated* by FREXIT, due to the fact that many people *dont rechive* *anymore* the part of the pie offered by the cosmopolitans, their biggest fear which their politican leadership depends to, is to *lose more* of this pie. The only country directly threating this pie from their camp is Turkey. Turkey is the *greatest* intra-opponent of France. They did lose Mali politically recently, and they are desperate to keep the country de stabilized and in war (we will analyze this in a coming article). Thus, with this victory of Azerbaijan, the *direct* comprador of Turkey, Turkey becomes more of a power in the region, and opens room for it to be more indepentent. Turkey will need to establish *more* compradors for them to one day become an autonomus cosmopolitan camp *separate* from EU-NATO, and this war was one of these comprador creation projects. The stronger Azerbaijan is, the stronger is Turkey.

Thus, t*he more indipentent and stronger* is Turkey, *the more* the imperialist cosmopolitan bourgeoisei *lose*.

This war, which took proletariat lives, benefited *only* the bourgeoisie. The *only* positives is that the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie lost, and that this *sensless* nation to nation bloodshit ended. This war also proved the *incopentense* of the communist parties in both countries, which desided to support the war in their sides instead of seizing the moment to enlarge themselfs.

This should serve as a lesson to the current and future generations of communists worlwide. It is in these situations where the party should become stronger. If it fails, it can only sink deeper to *irelevance*.

8/29/2021,[Diplomacy] Take it or Leave It (Proposal for Solution of Karabakh Issue),">\[2nd round of peace negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia hosted by Russian Federation in state head level attendance.\]

After the latest confrontation on the region in 2020 the peace negotiations that has been aimed in the result of the ceasefire couldn’t be reached. As had been shown by our side Azerbaijan is fully committed for solving the issue involving Karabakh and hostilities between the Armenia and Azerbaijan. After a period of consideration and planning we are offering another draft for a possible peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

**1)** **Status of Armenian Enclave in Karabakh.**

We are considering giving the defacto claimed Artsakh Republic status of independence in the determined borders mostly based on current line of contact under ceasefire. The new recognized Republic of Artsakh will be recognized by Azerbaijan if the mentioned state will accept;

* Recognization of the crimes against humanity during the occupation of Karabakh by Armenian forces.
* International trial of officials and preparators of massacres like the famous Khojaly genocide.
* Demilitarize the borders of the new republic for 10 years (in planned deadline) limited to 1 brigade worth of soldiers limited in border defense and inner security (determined by a negotiation and monitored by UN). After the mentioned deadline restriction of the new states military size will be renegotiated but entry of any foreign military force will be restricted in peace time will be forbidden.
* Denying any claims rather than determined border of the new state.
* Having normalization of relations (after 5 years of implementation of the peace deal) with Azerbaijan including opening of consulates and borders.
* Will grant the loss right of Azerbaijani nationals by the occupation during 90s by settled conditions determined by international courts.
* That will have restriction of joining to any other state by their new constitution.

In these conditions we are will accept the independence of the mentioned entity (Alternatively we also could negotiate a deal of land exchange between Armenia and Azerbaijan with the current Armenian enclave in Karabakh for appropriate land in zengezur region of Armenia)

**2)** **Status of Lachin and Zengezur Corridors**

In the case of peace settlement we are willing to grant a legal status to Lachin corridor currently being held by peacekeeping force in return for a similar corridor granted to Azerbaijan in Zengezur region (by Aras river).

* Both proposed corridors are proposed to be 10 km in width.
* Lachin corridor will be granted to new proposed state of Artsakh and Zengezur corridor will be granted to Azerbaijan Republic.
* Respectively in both corridors by the negotiation’s transportation solutions will be determined to keep the roads open trough the corridors for both nations like bridges and tunnels. Also, the determined corridors will be open to air traffic to both nations.
* Azerbaijan is willing to provide financial support for relocation of villages in zengezur corridor to Armenian Propper.
* Roads, pipelines, rail roads, logistical facilities in the corridors will be owned legally by respective nations that will have right to protect them in case of open aggression for securing them.
* Passage will be free in both corridors by the respective nation’s acceptance (Azerbaijan in Zengezur, Artsakh in Lachin). But the terms for demilitarization of Artsakh will be implemented trough Lachin corridor meaning the military assets movement from Lachin will require permission of Azerbaijan.
* For 10 year the mentioned corridors will be monitored and the deals implementation will be observed by a committee and a small military force under UN authority. In this process common practices and regulations between Azerbaijan and Artsakh will be determined for ensuring cooperative usage of the mentioned corridors for the future.

3. Normalization of Relations between Azerbaijan-Armenia-Artsakh

Azerbaijan is willing to take actions for normalization of relation with both Armenia and Artsakh after 3 years of deals implementation (after acceptance between parliaments of the deal) including opening of diplomatic representations, start of border crossing and economic relations. We also think Turkey will normalize relations according to the pace of Azerbaijan. For steps of normalization we can set a calendar aiming for 5-10 year period.

Additional notes:

* After the implementation of the deal, we expect UN forces to over take the role in corridors by 6 months from current peacekeeping force.
* Turkey will be granted status of guarantor in the integrity of zengezur corridor and Armenia will be guarantor of the integrity of lachin corridor.
* We are interested in hearing of Armenian concerns to the proposed deal but the Armenian government should understand the concession offered for the stable peace between our nations by Azerbaijani side is close to limits of what is possible."

4/9/2022,The future of US military assistance green light to the Aliyev regime against the backdrop of hostilities in Ukraine,"One year ago in April, US President Joe Biden extended the moratorium on the ban on the supply of military equipment and ammunition to Azerbaijan. No matter how the State Department denies, there are facts of the use of weapons received as military aid from the US and EU countries to advance positions in Karabakh, and for sale on the black market.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3ylegz2j0gs81.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe51cb9df232522f2bb3c4ad4010a1b3d4829fef

On April 6th 2022, the US Senate unanimously passes a bill allowing President Joe Biden to send arms and other supplies to Ukraine more quickly and, as stated, without unnecessary bureaucratic red tape. Reviving the lend-lease program, the bill was prepared by US senators in January, a month before hostilities.

The Biden administration's simplification of the procedure for the supply of American weapons to Ukraine debunks hopes for the suspension of military assistance to the Aliyev regime, that leads to an escalation in Karabakh.

In general, under the pretext of increasing the Russian threat, the leadership of the North Atlantic Alliance pursues the goal of freeing warehouses from unnecessary equipment to build up the latest military products (in particular, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Jevilin anti-tank systems).

The leadership of Ukraine openly criticizes the effectiveness of obsolete weapons received as part of military assistance. So, for example, while Poland is strengthening its own tank fleet with the purchase of 250 modernized М1А2 Abrams SEPv3 from the USA for $4.74 billion, they promise to give Kiev the T-72.

In turn, the American defense industry is preparing to conclude other major contracts for the supply of weapons to Europe. Despite sanctions imposed by Washington on Turkey after the acquisition of Russian S-400s, the State Department approved a plan to sell 40 F-16 fighters to Ankara. Another factor in the strengthening of American military assistance to Azerbaijan is Ankara's lobbying for the interests of the Aliyev regime in those aspects that meet the interests of Washington."

Are azerbaijani orign proto-states like the Atabegs of Azerbaijan or azerbaijani confederations like the Qarakoyunlu and Akkoyunlu mentiomed? If so, how are they described? And what about  Azerbaijani dynasties like the Safavids or Qajars? Are khanates like Karabakh or Irevan discussed?

 Describing the situation in Azerbaijan, they tend to narrate Armenian history in a somewhat discreet manner. For instance, when discussing the Armenian principalities or kingdoms, they try to convey the idea that it was a state distant from the Caucasus, leaning towards Anatolia. Similarly, when talking about the Khamsa Melikdoms, they generally refer to them as ""local Christian communities dependent on Karabakh Khanate"" and avoid using term of ""Armenian"".

Thanks to anyone who bothers replying!"
5/9/2018,"[Shakedown] My packing list for an attempted traverse of the Greater Caucasus Mountains (Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan)","This summer, I'm trying to hike across the entire Greater Caucasus Mountain range from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, partly following a route of my own design, and partly making it up as I go along.

I start in Sochi, Russia and (hopefully) end up in Baku, Azerbaijan, maybe 2-3 months later. 

Terrain etc is going to involve: regularly bushwhacking through dense vegetation, forests with bears, sketchy river crossings, lots of big snowy mountains with tricky passes sometimes around 3500-4000m (initially), then, after Russia, increasingly dry and arid mountains usually closer to 2500-3000m. 

Temps will be anywhere between 0 degrees C and 30+ degrees C. It's all in mountains, so storms and prolonged gash weather will be a regular occurrence. 

There'll often be very limited opportunities to stock up on any packaged food. I'll sometimes have to buy stuff from kind villagers or shepherds (I'm learning Russian). Stove fuel of any kind, and reliable electricity points are an unknown quantity for many sections.

There won't be any proper paths a lot of the time, let alone way-marks, and not many people around either, especially in the highest portions. I'll also need to deal with military officials checking me for border permits, and hopefully not trying to make me bribe them...

Because of all this, and despite extensive prior experience, I'm probably still packing some fears here that can maybe be defused or at least more usefully defined by anyone who's still reading this.

In terms of other info that informs some of my equipment decisions: 

- I don't like fragile stuff like cuben tents/rucksacks (I tried a Solplex in Romania's Carpathian Mountains last year, and it nearly got torn apart by the wind on the first night!) 

- I appear to sleep a bit cold, and generally run a bit cold.

- I'm not a fan of hiking in prolonged rain and wind at high altitude without ""luxury"" items like full waterproofs, including gloves (try navigating with numb hands) and a decent midlayer. This attitude seems different to many on here, I can only assume that the weather in the States is generally warmer/more settled than Europe?!

- I need trousers for this trip because I'll pass through many places where shorts are not as acceptable for religious/cultural reasons. It also might be chilly near the start. Plus, the sun. 

- I need to have some kind of backup GPS and emergency satellite communication, mostly for my mum's sanity...

- I need maps and a compass because they don't break easily, and I find that using them connects me more with my surroundings.

My base weight right now is about 6.4kg's. I'd ideally like it to be well below 6kg, but finding it hard to strip away anything else now. I keep getting tempted to try stoveless but I love hot coffee, and also warm food/drink can be a real life saver when the weather is brutal for a few days and I'm camped alone in high mountains. 

I'm gonna have to sort out at least one resupply with some new shoes and a few other bits halfway. I'll also be able to get rid of my crampons/axe after the Western Caucasus, which'll save me about 700g's. 

Here's my list as it stands:

It is possible that Russia will continue its activities in the format of an observation mission in Garabagh,"" said Igor Korotchenko, the Editor-in-Chief of the Russian National Defense Journal and a renowned military expert, APA reports.

Korotchenko speaking at a round table, named “The development of South Caucasus after the end of Gabagah conflict” with the participation of Russian and Azerbaijani experts in the online format, noted that Azerbaijan's military victory created a new geopolitical reality in the region: “The new geopolitical reality arose as the result of the events that happened in the last three years in the South Caucasus - September 27, 2020, Second Garabagh War and September 19-20 the anti-terrorist measures implemented by the Azerbaijani Armed Forces. This reality is that Azerbaijan has ""de facto"" and ""de jure"" restored its territorial integrity. This reality, indeed, requires a new understanding in terms of the future development of the region. Here we are talking about how the development in the region will unfold, what the interests of the main parties will be, how the future formats on mutual relations between Russia and Azerbaijan will be.

First of all, it should be noted that all activities of Azerbaijan were in line with international law. Therefore, the attempts of these or other countries and power centers to put pressure on Azerbaijan and to question the legitimacy of the measures it has taken are completely illegal. We see that not all countries and power centers rejoice in the changes taking place in the region. We observe a rather contradictory and hypocritical position of the official Yerevan, which on the one hand recognizes the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, and on the other hand, tries to attract foreign actors to the region as a force of influence. We see France as a country with a destructive position, which is not satisfied with just supporting Armenia, but is trying to break the peace process in the South Caucasus."""

So I wanted to delve a bit more into this topic without all the nationalism (even though I'm sure I'll get a lot of it, and that's still fine - I actually find some of the nationalist back and forth humorous ""Churchxela is Armenian"" is hilarious, though some of the fallout I think is damaging). Anyhow, was just curious to get people's opinions on it especially as I travel more throughout the Caucasus (planning on going to Armenia soon enough, then if Azerbaijan lets me in when the land borders reopen, Azerbaijan as well).

https://www.facebook.com/thierrykovacs/posts/24668151459438605?ref=embed_post

Thierry Kovacs, Mayor of Vienne, France, reports on his Facebook page:

Since Russia's aggression against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, we have decided to support Ukraine by placing the Ukrainian flag on the pediment of Vienna City Hall.

This invasion of a sovereign state has indeed called into question the fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter.

However, the Ukrainian President's recent statements on his telephone exchange with the dictator of Azerbaijan, in which he expressed a shared attachment to the principles of state sovereignty and territorial integrity, raise questions.

It is impossible to claim Western values and, on that basis, call on the West to come to the rescue, while at the same time sharing the vision of a regime responsible for ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Nor can we thank Baku for the humanitarian aid provided to Kiev, particularly in the energy sector as winter approaches, while pretending to ignore the fact that Azerbaijan is in fact selling gas - and Russian gas at 1.5 times the price - to finance its war effort against Armenia, the only truly democratic state in the Caucasus.

This form of support for the Azeri dictator is unacceptable.

I have therefore decided to remove the Ukrainian flag from the pediment of the Town Hall. This in no way detracts from Vienne's support for the Ukrainian people, but we cannot fight a totalitarian regime in the name of European values, while at the same time encouraging another dictatorial and barbaric regime.

It's a question of consistency."

8/19/2023,Why are Azerbaijani and Turkish languages so similar despite being separated by a whole millennium?,"
Some people even argue they could be considered dialects due to the languages being so similar.

And yet, the last common ancestry of Azeris and Turkish people was in Gokturk empire in the Middle Ages. It seems that Oghuzic Turks of Azerbaijan and Türkiye migrated west of Caspian separately and very possibly Turkic came to Caucasus during the Mongol invasions. Through centuries, except for a short period during the rule of Sultan Selim, Oghuzic Turks of Anatolia (modern day Türkiye) and Caucasus (modern day Azerbaijan) were separate states with separate, often competing cultures. During that period Turks of Türkiye had Greek, Armenian, Balkan, Arab and even European influence (a lot of modern words come from French), meanwhile Azeris were influenced by Iranians and Russians. And yet the languages are so closely related you would think the split was very recent."

Its only overland access route to Armenia is via the 5 km  wide Lachin corridor.

10/11/2023,My trip through Caucasus & Turkey," I’m planning a trip across Europe. I’m flying to Baku in a week. The idea is that I want to cross Europe by train & bus. I’ll start from the East (Baku, Azerbaijan) to the West (Brest, France).

[Trip from Baku to Brest](https://preview.redd.it/emcy3zns8ltb1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d4376dea3d97b7a430b4d8cdd467bfb0f86e96)

I’ve already been to every country to the West of Istanbul, so I’m more interested in feedback and tips regarding Turkey and the Caucasus.

There are some constraints visiting the Caucasus, as many borders are closed (Armenia has closed borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey). The border between Azerbaijan and Georgia is one-way only. My understanding is that no bus or train will cross the border, but it’s possible to get to the border by bus, then cross it on foot, and get a bus on the other side.

Here's my approximate itinerary:

* Oct 17: arrival at Baku, Azerbaijan
* Oct 18 - 20 Baku, Azerbaijan
   * Gobustan
   * Sheki (day trip or stay overnight?)
* Oct 21 - 22 Ganja, Azerbaijan
* Oct 23 - 26 Tbilisi, Georgia
   * Sighnaghi day trip
* Oct 27 - 31 Yerevan, Armenia
* Nov 1 Tbilisi, Georgia (not sure if I can avoid going back there)
* Nov 2 - 3 Kutaisi, Georgia
* Nov 4 - 5 Batumi, Georgia
* Nov 6 - 7 Trabzon, Turkey
* Nov 8 - 10 Kayseri, Turkey
   * Göreme
* Nov 11 - 12 Ankara, Turkey
* Nov 13 - 14 Istanbul, Turkey (already visited)
* Nov 15 - 24 Plovdiv, Sofia, Nis, Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Munich
* then Paris, Brest

I won’t book anything in advance, as I want to have flexibility. In particular, I expect to add a few more days depending on my mood, energy and things to visit. To save time, I may use night buses to cover longer distances.

Would you have suggestions of things to change in the plan? I expect to do day trips from Baku, Tbilisi and Yerevan.

How reliable is the transport in the region? I've heard there's marshrutka, or train. Do I need to plan in advance or just go at the station and ask?

Thanks!"

4/16/2018,Planning trip to Caucasus and starting in Azerbaijan,"Hello, I’m an American planning on traveling to the Caucasus right before grad school, and I’m going to start in Azerbaijan. The flight I’m looking at, on your country’s airline, lands on the 5th in June at 6am. My plan is to go to Gobustan for the glyphs and mud volcanoes they have there.  Then spend the next day in Baku. The following day would be spent at the ruins of Old Qabala then I’d go to Sheki. Spend a day there, then travel to Georgia. Is that a good itinerary?  I’m having difficulty finding a ways to get to Old Qabala and was looking for advice.  Also what’s the easiest way to get to Gobustan?
