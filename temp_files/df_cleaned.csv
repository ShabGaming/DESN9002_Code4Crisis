We all agree a breakaway state is pointless, so I genuinely don’t understand why the option of the Armenians in the Armenian separatist territory (not including the territories where Azeris were ethnically cleansed in the 90s by Armenian soldiers) let them join as a part of Armenia with a Lachin corridor (owned by Azerbaijan, controlled by Turkey) connecting it to Armenia proper and a Zangezur corridor (owned by Armenia, controlled by a foreign power like France or Russia or America) connecting Nahkchivan to Azerbaijan proper… to me this seems like the most logical solution that would result in long term peace and least problems. It is clear to me that the Armenians currently in Nagorno-Karabakh are unwilling to be a part of Azerbaijan, so I don’t see why Azerbaijan would go through the trouble of trying to pacify them.  

Please explain why this is or is not an acceptable solution in the comments, any response appreciated. Thank you 🙏",1

On 9 November 2020, a ceasefire was signed between Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan brokered by Russian President Vladimir Putin officially ending the second Nagorno-Karabakh war.  


Details and the terms of the agreement:  


1. A complete ceasefire and end to all hostilities in the Karabakh conflict from 00:00 Moscow time on November 10 2020. The Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia, hereinafter referred to as the parties stop at the positions they occupy.
2. [Aghdam District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agdam_District) returns to the Republic of Azerbaijan by November 20 2020.
3. Along the contact line in Nagorno-Karabakh and along the [Lachin corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachin_corridor) there will be a peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation in the amount of 1960 military personnel with small arms, 90 armoured personnel carriers, 380 automotive units and special equipment.
4. The peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation is deployed in parallel with the withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces. The duration of the peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation is 5 years with automatic renewal for the next 5 year periods if none of the parties state otherwise 6 months in advance.
5. In order to improve the effectiveness of control over the implementation by the Parties to the conflict agreements, a peacekeeping centre is being deployed to control the ceasefire.
6. The Republic of Armenia will return to Azerbaijan the [Kalbajar District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalbajar_District) by November 15th 2020 and the [Lachin District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachin_District) by December 1st. The [Lachin corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachin_corridor) (5 km (3.1 mi) wide) which will provide communication to Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, without affecting the town of [Shusha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shusha) remains under the control of the peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation. By agreement of the Parties, a construction plan will be determined in the next three years for a new route of movement along the Lachin corridor, providing a link between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia with the subsequent redeployment of the Russian peacekeeping contingent to guard this route. The Republic of Azerbaijan guarantees the safety of traffic along the Lachin corridor of citizens, vehicles, and goods in both directions.
7. Internally displaced persons and refugees return to the territories of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent areas under the control of the [UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Office_of_the_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees).
8. The exchange of prisoners of war is to be made, hostages, and other detainees as well as the remains of casualties.
9. All economic and transport links in the region are to be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia guarantees the safety of transport links between western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to organise the unimpeded movement of citizens, vehicles and cargo in both directions. Transport control is carried out by the bodies of the Border Service of the FSB of Russia. By agreement of the Parties, the construction of new transport communications linking the [Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic) with regions of Azerbaijan is to take place.  


**TLDR:**   


* Armenian forces leave Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding districts completely. Parts of Nagorno-Karabakh captured by Azerbaijan during the war ([Shusha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shusha), [Hadrut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrut), [Azykh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azokh), [Suqovuşan (Madagiz)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagiz)) and other smaller towns/villages) will remain under full Azerbaijani control and administration.   

* Remaining parts of Nagorno-Karabakh ([Khankendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepanakert), [Khojavend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojavend_(town)), [Aghdara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martakert), [Khojaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojaly_(town))) will have Russian peacekeepers. The details about the administration of these places are not public yet, but it is known that it won't be Armenia or the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh.   

* Azerbaijan will get a road to Nakhchivan through Armenia. The road will be controlled by Russian peacekeepers.  

* There are rumours about Turkish peacekeepers, but it is not confirmed yet. Even if there are no Turkish peacekeepers, strong Turkish presence in the conflict and South Caucasus is expected.  

* Russia will stay in the remaining parts of Nagorno-Karabakh for 5 years. This period will be renewed for another 5 years if no side objects after the first 5 years.  

* All surrounding districts will be returned to Azerbaijan until 1 December.

 Global freedom faces a dire threat. Around the world, the enemies of liberal democracy—a form of self-government in which human rights are recognized and every individual is entitled to equal treatment under law—are accelerating their attacks. Authoritarian regimes have become more effective at co-opting or circumventing the norms and institutions meant to support basic liberties, and at providing aid to others who wish to do the same. In countries with long-established democracies, internal forces have exploited the shortcomings in their systems, distorting national politics to promote hatred, violence, and unbridled power. Those countries that have struggled in the space between democracy and authoritarianism, meanwhile, are increasingly tilting toward the latter. The global order is nearing a tipping point, and if democracy’s defenders do not work together to help guarantee freedom for all people, the authoritarian model will prevail. 

Freedom scores (higher=better):

- Armenia: 54/100

- **Nagorno-Karabakh: 37/100**

- Turkey: 32/100

- Russia: 12/100

- Azerbaijan: 9/100

As I understand it, this conflict is not very ""unique"". People from two nations have been living on a piece of land, and now they can't decide who it belongs to. However, unlike places like Israel and Kashmir, where similar conflicts happen, it seems to me (an outsider and layman) that the two peoples have quite a lot in common AND both countries could benefit from uniting. There isn't a huge power imbalance between the two, so it's not like one would leech off the other. By uniting, people could keep living where they live, fighting would stop, and they could be a stronger country overall. Of course the big neighbors would not like this, but they are already making too much money on this conflict.

Is this just daydreaming? What are the holes in this theory? If I am wrong on something, please don't be upset, but tell me about it. I never intended to pick a side or spread misinformation.

Edit: thanks for all the replies everybody! I suspected from the start that just asking the fighters to put down the weapons wouldn't work. After all, a war is what neither part wants, but it has led to this anyway. But reading all your replies and links to resources is really interesting, this is a part of the world I already knew little about.",1

9/15/2022,What are your thoughts on the Armenia–Azerbaijan border crisis?,"[Context](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict): The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is an ethnic and territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, inhabited mostly by ethnic Armenians,and seven surrounding districts, inhabited mostly by Azerbaijanis until their evacuation in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.

The conflict had and increased in attacks by Azerbaijan with Russia pulling out “peace keeping” forces out of Armenia. Armenia called for article 4 of CSTO but Russia said no. So what are your thoughts and who do you stand with?",1
10/17/2023,Opinion | We Just Saw What the World Is About to Become,"> The history of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh was ended in the old manner of conflict resolution: siege, conquest, expulsion. After a 10-month blockade, Azerbaijan launched an attack on Sept. 19, claiming the enclave in a day and causing nearly the entire ethnic Armenian population to flee. Give war a chance, as the saying goes.

> For Armenians, a classic relic ethnic minority whose Christianity and peculiar alphabet date to the epic struggles between the Romans and the Parthians, it was another genocide. For the Azerbaijanis, Turkic in language and historically Shia Muslim, a great triumph. Yet despite appearances, the conflict is not a Samuel Huntington-style clash of civilizations. Instead, in its emboldening of traditional regional powers like Turkey, scrambling for geopolitical spoils after the retreat of superpowers, it’s a harbinger of the coming world disorder.

> Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region in the South Caucasus, is perennially contested. Ceded by Persia to Russia in the 19th century, it fell into dispute with the emergence of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan both claiming it. In 1921, Stalin attached the enclave to Azerbaijan, home to oil resources and a thriving intellectual culture. Yet the thin crust of Azeri modernist intelligentsia was eliminated in Stalin’s purges of the 1930s and replaced by corrupt functionaries overseen by the formidable K.G.B. general Heydar Aliyev. (His son, Ilham Aliyev, is the dynastic president of Azerbaijan.)

> In 1988, Mikhail Gorbachev’s dreams of achieving a more rational, humane Soviet Union emboldened Armenian intellectuals to start a tremendous popular movement for uniting the Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh with mainland Armenia. This seemed deceptively easy: transfer a province from one Soviet republic to another. But the Armenian demands ran into protests in Azerbaijan that almost immediately turned violent. Gorbachev looked impotent in the face of disasters he had provoked. From there to the end of the superpower, it took just three years.

> In the chaotic aftermath of Soviet collapse, the Armenians undertook to defend Nagorno-Karabakh by force. Instead of poetic intellectuals, the wartime generation of Armenian leaders became militia commanders. They proved earthier and, soon, brazenly corrupt. Defending the country became their sole means of legitimacy, ruling out the concessions that peace would require. By 1994 the Armenians, mobilizing around the traumatic memories of genocide, succeeded in expelling scores of Azeris from the enclave. Last month, Azerbaijan got more than even.

> In that project, it had a powerful backer: Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a master of vertiginous visions, has already tried Islamic liberalism, joining Europe, leading the Arab revolts, challenging Israel and negotiating peace in Ukraine. He now has another dream: opening a geopolitical corridor from Europe through Central Asia, all the way to China. This is the “Zangezur corridor,” a 25-mile-long strip of land to be carved through Armenia as part of a peace deal imposed at gunpoint.

> Iran is not happy with Azerbaijan’s victory. As openly as the Iranians ever do, they’ve threatened to use force against any changes to the borders of Armenia. Iran, a millenniums-old civilization central to a whole continent, cannot tolerate being walled off behind a chain of Turkish dependencies. India, similarly, is on Armenia’s side and has been sending a regular supply of weapons. One spur for such support, no doubt, is Pakistan’s joining the Azeri-Turkish alliance. In the jargon of American lawyers, this opens a whole new can of worms.

> Then there’s Russia, whose absence from the denouement in Nagorno-Karabakh was striking. Even after the 1990s, Moscow still remained by far the biggest supplier of weapons to both Armenia and Azerbaijan. Their economies and societies, above all the elites and their corruption networks, were until very recently molded together. What we are seeing now, as both nations slip out of Russia’s orbit, might be the second round of Soviet collapse.

> Once again, Armenia started the shift. In spring 2018 a tremendously hopeful uprising, reminiscent of 1989 in Central Europe, forced the post-communist elites to surrender power. Vladimir Putin was visibly displeased to meet Nikol Pashinyan, the anticorruption journalist and street rebel elected Armenia’s premier by an overwhelming majority. Mr. Pashinyan admittedly had neither political team nor experience; he is learning statesmanship on the job, often at great expense to his nation. Yet he managed to significantly reduce corruption, helping to unlock the legendary entrepreneurship of Armenians. Amid all the grim news, the Armenian economy, led by the I.T. sector, is registering impressive growth.

> All that, to Moscow, is punishable. When in September 2020 Azerbaijan launched a massive offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh lasting 44 terrible days, Russia effectively allowed Azerbaijan and Turkey to nearly destroy its Armenian ally, under the pretext that Karabakh was outside the mutual defense treaty. At the cusp of Azeri victory, however, Mr. Putin personally brokered a cease-fire and ordered a crack force of his peacekeepers into the enclave.

> That brought nearly all the perimeter of the former Soviet Union into Russia’s sphere of influence. Rebellious Belarus, its dictator dependent on Russian support, was in hand; so too the war-torn Caucasus. The large and oil-rich Kazakhstan itself requested Russian peacekeepers during a bewildering bout of street violence in January 2022. Strangely, the elite Russian troops soon departed from Kazakhstan. A month later, the whole world realized that they had been dispatched to Ukraine, the last sizable piece of Mr. Putin’s post-Soviet gambit. And there his plan broke down.

> History has a habit of serving the same lessons with changed variables. In 1988, it was the dreamer Gorbachev stumbling over Nagorno-Karabakh that unwittingly shattered the world order. Today, Mr. Putin could become the second, much darker incarnation of the Kremlin aggrandizer going awry on all fronts. The consequences — from emboldening international aggression to reanimating the West under the banner of NATO — will be profound. As events in Nagorno-Karabakh show, the fragile post-Cold War order is giving way to something else entirely.

> The Caucasus might seem strange and distant. Yet it might prove the wedge that turns the fortunes of world order. Trieste, Smyrna, Sarajevo, Danzig and Crimea were all such places. Let us not have to relearn history at the cost of yet another ethnic cleansing.",1

It is vital that we don’t re-circulate videos or images that may show our positions on the front line. The Armenian military has already asked that people don’t post any information regarding this invasion.

Trust me I know how badly we want to know what’s going on, but for the sake of our country we can’t. No matter how well intentioned a video of a tank moving through a village for morale may very well lead to the death our Armenian troops. Save lives don’t post.

**Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

Recently the UK based Conciliation Resources released a documentary jointly produced by Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists. This is agreed to be the most neutral account of the conflict ever made, you can watch it online here: https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict

Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through Peace and War by Thomas de Waal is agreed to be the best book on the conflict: https://nyupress.org/9780814760321/black-garden/

---

**Is there a peace plan?**

Azerbaijan and the Armenian side have agreed in principle to the settlement process mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group co-chaired by the US, Russia and France with a mandate from the UN, which since 2009 has consisted of the following proposal:

 > The ministers of the US, France, and Russia presented a preliminary version of the Basic Principles for a settlement to Armenia and Azerbaijan in November 2007 in Madrid.

 > The Basic Principles reflect a reasonable compromise based on the Helsinki Final Act principles of Non-Use of Force, Territorial Integrity, and the Equal Rights and Self-Determination of Peoples.

 > The Basic Principles call for inter alia:

 >- return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control;

 >- an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

 >- a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

 >- future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

 >- the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and

 >- international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

 > The endorsement of these Basic Principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan will allow the drafting of a comprehensive settlement to ensure a future of peace, stability, and prosperity for Armenia and Azerbaijan and the broader region.

However there has been no meaningful progress in the negotiations, meanwhile the mediating group focusing on containing the conflict proposed to *harden the ceasefire regime* following the 2016 April ""four day war"" as well as following the [Armenian revolution of 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Armenian_revolution) made a proposal to the sides to *prepare the populations for peace*. 

[Thomas de Waal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_de_Waal):

> Russia, the US and the EU have enough tools to contain both sides, but they have neither the time, nor the energy, nor the desire to try to force Armenia and Azerbaijan to conclude peace, let alone send peacekeepers who will have to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

[Sergey Markedonov (Carnegie Moscow Center)](https://carnegie.ru/commentary/experts/1196):

> Russia is well aware that the search for compromises is the business of the Armenian and Azerbaijani sides. They are not ready for this, but no one will do this work for them.

**What disinformation is prevalent about this conflict?**

One of the most entrenched disinformations is that pertaining to the nature of the UN Security Council resolutions on the conflict. 

The UN Security Council resolutions concern with and recognise the invasions and occupations of the [*surrounding territories*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_Nagorno-Karabakh#:~:text=The%20Armenian%2Dcontrolled%20territories%20surrounding,of%20Artsakh%20supported%20by%20Armenia.) of Nagorno-Karabakh carried out by local Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh.

The UN Security Council resolutions 

1. do NOT recognise Republic of Armenia having invaded or occupied any territories, 

2. do NOT recognise Nagorno-Karabakh as occupied or invaded territory,

3. do NOT demand Republic of Armenia to withdraw forces from any territories,

4. do NOT demand any forces to be withdrawn from Nagorno-Karabakh.

> **Information Point**

> - **What is all this about?** On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with Turkish backing launched a war against the de facto Nagorno Karabakh Republic in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) through military means despite the existing peace process.

> - Azerbaijan has targeted 120 civilian settlements, including the capital Stepanakert with drones, missiles, smerch and artillery bombardment as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing half of the civilians to leave Nagorno Karabakh.

> - **Is Nagorno Karabakh occupied?** No. Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refrain from labelling Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, instead often label it as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918. 

> - Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) has three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - [Map with place names](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/02/fighting-nagorno-karabakh-is-about-local-territories-wider-rivalries/)

> - The four [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories. Instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and the latter to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions concern the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993.

> - **Is there a peace plan?** Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution package by OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - Azerbaijan has targeted 120 civilian settlements, including the capital Stepanakert with drones, missiles, smerch and artillery bombardment as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing half of the civilians to leave Nagorno Karabakh.

> - **Is Nagorno Karabakh occupied?** No. Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refrain from labelling Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, instead often label it as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

There are independent journalists from reputable international media in Nagorno Karabakh reporting on events.",1
9/21/2023,Pashinyan addressed the public (translated with Source),"The source in Armenian: https://www.civilnet.am/news/751512/փաշինյանի-խոսքով՝-40-հազար-ընտանիք-տեղավորելու-շուրջ-նախապատրաստական-աշխատանքներ-են-իրականացվել/

Currently, there is no direct threat to the civilian population of Nagorno Karabakh. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced this a while ago, addressing the citizens live.

""I have accused Azerbaijan for a long time that they are subjecting the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to ethnic cleansing. Now that we are analyzing the situation, we get the impression that there are forces that want to carry out the Azerbaijani plan to subject Nagorno Karabakh to ethnic cleansing so that Azerbaijan, so to speak, has no reason to be blamed. In other words, let's say: look at Armenia, the Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh decided that no Armenians should stay in Nagorno Karabakh and they left,"" Pashinyan noted, adding that preparatory works were carried out to accommodate approximately 40 thousand families in the republic.

""But we don't want to say about this, why, because we believe that the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh should live in their land.

Pashinyan also added that the previous day more than **10 thousand people were invited to Stepanakert airport for transportation to Armenia**.

""**They were photographed and videotaped, after which they said that the Republic of Armenia does not allow you to go to Armenia**. It is obvious to me that this is being done in order to cause internal political upheavals and tension in Armenia,"" said Pashinyan, adding that currently various circles ""want the government to shed blood in Yerevan"", which will not happen. the government will be within the law and strict.

#About the violation of the ceasefire regime in Artsakh

Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan also provided information on the current situation in Artsakh. In particular, he said that after the establishment of a ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh, **the units of the Defense Army continue to stay in the places where they were at the time of the establishment of the ceasefire**.

""Today, unfortunately, an incident took place near Stepanakert, in general the ceasefire regime is maintained. I saw that there are reports that Azerbaijani troops are in Stepanakert, of course, there is no such thing,"" said Pashinyan.

According to him, there are certain problems on the road leading to Martakert and Martuni.

""One of the issues that take our greatest attention is **information about mass casualties** among the civilian population, which simply do not correspond to reality,"" he said.

Pashinyan asked not to forget for a moment that from the beginning he stated that one of the goals of this process is to involve Armenia in military operations. ""This is one issue that aims to create chaos in Armenia. The fact that a ceasefire has been established in Nagorno-Karabakh does not mean that these goals are no longer on the agenda of the people who brought them,"" added Pashinyan.

He emphasized again that Armenia was not in any way a participant in the discussions on establishing a ceasefire in Karabakh, it was only aware of the processes.

He also blamed the Russian peacekeeping troops, saying that one should not turn a blind eye to all the lapses made by the peacekeepers in Artsakh.

#About the Evlakh meeting

Pashinyan also referred to the meeting between the representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan in Evlakh. He said that the authorities of Artsakh have not yet published official information, but the **Azerbaijani side has presented details and tried to create an impression that the processes are proceeding in a positive direction**.

According to Pashinyan, **this may have something to do with today's meeting of the UN Security Council**, where the humanitarian situation in Nagorno Karabakh is discussed.",1

> **Information Point**

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the UN-mandated OSCE settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refer to Nagorno Karabakh as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed autonomous region since 1923 which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918 until today. Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history going back millennia.

> - The ceasefire agreement in 1994 had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh. 

> - The UN Security Council resolutions do not recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, nor demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh, nor recognise Armenia as an invader, nor demand any withdrawals by Armenia, instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Nov 4 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 50 civilian killed, 148 wounded and 19000 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict).

> **What is all this about?** *(updated Oct 24)*

> -  On Sept 27 Azerbaijan with [direct](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) involvement of [Turkey](https://twitter.com/anca_dc/status/1286024085022150662?lang=en) using its [Jihadist mercenaries](https://observers.france24.com/fr/20201020-videos-document-presence-mercenaires-syriens-conflit-haut-karabakh) from [Syria](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) and elsewhere launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using extreme and remorseless violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while rejecting [UN's calls to stop fighting](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) and also [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162) due to the pandemic.

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-emergency-azerbaijan-s-attack-in-artsakh) (*23 Oct*), [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the sieged [indigenous Armenian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Artsakh) of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has intentionally violated international law by [severely damaging](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/ad_hoc_reports) 130 cities and villages including the capital of Nagorno Karabakh Stepanakert using aerial bombings, drone attacks, precision missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic strikes and artillery means as well as [usage](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/23/azerbaijan-cluster-munitions-used-nagorno-karabakh) of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of Oct 24 Azerbaijan's concerted destruction against the ethnic Armenian civilians of Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in 40 civilian killed, 120 wounded and 13100 civilian infrastructure destroyed, including homes, apartments, hospitals, schools, civilian vehicles as well as key civilian infrastructure vital to the survival of the civilian population. The destruction includes cultural heritage manifested by the [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html).

>-  As of Oct 24, Armenian KIA amount to a thousand, making it higher per capita than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

>- Neither the maxim of [""there is no military solution to the conflict""](https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1319731617951326218?s=20) always repeated by the [US](https://am.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-kerry-united-states-condemns-ceasefire-violations-along-nagorno-karabakh-line-contact/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/crises-and-conflicts/article/armenia-azerbaijan-first-anniversary-of-the-truce-following-the-four-day-war-05), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/council-europe/86524/eu-statement-nagorno-karabakh_en), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), among others, nor all the calls for an unconditional ceasefire and resumption of negotiations made by the UN, EU, NATO, France, Russia and the US, among others, nor the two [humanitarian ceasefires](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-10/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-humanitarian-ceasefire-announced-moscow) brokered by Russia and France which were summarily violated by Azerbaijan with backing from Turkey, have persuaded the latter to halt the violence.

>- As of Oct 24, after all the devastation, heavy destruction of armour of both sides, and over 6000 killed personnel of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Turkish-backed Jihadi mercenaries, and Turkish Armed Forces, as per the military leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan is in control of some of the southern areas of the surrounding territories [to the south](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jhealg/map_of_military_operations_in_artsakh/) and a small portion to the north east - all of them low lands.

> **What's up with Nagorno Karabakh?**

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never been under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia, the last one [backed by the European Parliament in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20), culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law. The UN-mandated OSCE led by the [US](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign) and Russia, and backed by the [UN](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [EU](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell), [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) and [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities), among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - There are four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) from 1993 which called for cease of hostilities and mandated the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions were triggered because of the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the [Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories - which is why there were no grounds for invoking [Chapter VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) either.

> - Same as above also applies to the only other existing non-binding [2008 UN General Assembly resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the UN-mandated OSCE framework to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The vast majority of UN member states [abstained from voting in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243#Voted_for) of this Azerbaijani-drafted unilateral resolution, and the vast majority of states which voted in favour were members of [OIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation) and [GUAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development).

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - The constitution of the de facto republic states that Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous, while [not laying claim](http://www.nkr.am/en/chapter-XII-final-and-transitional-provisions) on the surrounding territories.

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

> - US Department of State in-depth [discussion of conflict resolution](https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/averting-all-out-war-nagorno-karabakh).

> - Entities backing the OSCE peace plan: [UN General Secretary](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign), [EU High Rep Foreign Affairs](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell),  [NATO Sec. General](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), [Council of Europe Sec. General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

> **Information Point**

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the UN-mandated OSCE settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE is co-chaired by the US, France and Russia, and is backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

> - All reputable international media refer to Nagorno Karabakh as disputed.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed autonomous region since 1923 which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918 until today. Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history going back millennia.

> - The ceasefire agreement in 1994 had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh. 

> - The UN Security Council resolutions do not recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, nor demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh, nor recognise Armenia as an invader, nor demand any withdrawals by Armenia, instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh.

> **What is all this about?**

> -  On 27th of September, Azerbaijan with [Turkish](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jch0yi/forcing_a_conflict_sources_tell_kommersant_how/) backing and using [Syrian mercenaries](https://www.syriahr.com/en/188669) launched a [devastating war](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jdom3g/at_front_lines_of_a_brutal_war_death_and_despair/g9bhun5/) against the de facto [Nagorno Karabakh Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) in an attempt to resolve the lingering [Karabakh conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) using violence despite the existing [peace process](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) while [rejecting UN's appeal for a global ceasefire due to the pandemic](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/cc25d0bb4dbeac0ff36dcf133fc9f162).

> - Independent organisations have raised alarms of [ethnic cleansing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/humanitarian-crisis-unfolds-and-around-nagorny-karabakh) and a [humanitarian catastrophe](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-conflict/reducing-human-cost-new-nagorno-karabakh-war) for the indigenous Armenian population of Nagorno Karabakh.

> - Azerbaijan has severely damaged 130 civilian settlements including the capital Stepanakert with aerial, drones, missiles, smerch, semi-ballistic and artillery means as well the use of [cluster bombs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/armenia-azerbaijan-civilians-must-be-protected-from-use-of-banned-cluster-bombs/) against civilian settlements causing [half of the Armenian civilians](https://www.care-international.org/news/press-releases/care-is-particularly-worried-about-the-thousands-of-women-refugees-and-migrants-affected-by-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict) to be [forced to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-54515067) and the remaining to live in [underground shelters](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-54408167).

> - As of October 16, Azerbaijan's violence has resulted in: A total of 36 civilians have been killed - a little girl, 7 women and 28 men. A total of 115 people were wounded, of which 95 received serious injuries: 77 of them are male and 18 are female citizens. Severe damage inflicted upon civilians properties: 7800 private immovable properties, 720 private movable properties, 1310 infrastructure, public and industrial objects including [bombing of a 19th century Armenian church](https://www.bild.de/politik/international/bild-international/bild-reporter-at-armenian-frontline-church-bombed-to-ruins-73330690.bild.html). Over 700 Armenian military personnel and volunteers have also been killed, making the KIA per capita higher than the KIA of the Vietnam War.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed [autonomous region since 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh#Soviet_era) which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence. Nagorno Karabakh has never been governed by the state of Azerbaijan and has never under control of an independent Azerbaijan.

> - Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority indigenous Armenian presence since long before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918.  Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history [going back millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Artsakh).

> - Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory and it is not referred to as such by the international community, the UN, OSCE, third party [experts](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1316306604111912962?s=20), and all reputable international media. Nagorno Karabakh is considered by the international community as a break-away enclave where its Armenian indigenous population has agency with legal backing. Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as was known during the USSR-era  made several petitions to join Armenia culminating in an independence referendum. 

> - The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the [UN-mandated OSCE](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152) settlement as also agreed to by Azerbaijan on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 among other norms of international law.

> - The UN-mandated OSCE led by the US, France and Russia, and backed by the UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe, among others, non-optionally applies the [principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152).

> - The European Parliament passed a [resolution in 1988](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/jc6ey7/very_important_document_in_1988_the_european/g8zow20) supporting the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with the Armenia SSR.

> - The four existing [UN Security Council resolutions](http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) call for cease of hostilities and mandate the conflict to be settled under the OSCE framework, with the latter determining the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. These resolutions mainly concern the capture of surrounding territories *around* Nagorno Karabakh by the Nagorno Karabakh forces during the final months of the Karabakh War in 1993. These resolutions do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied; do NOT demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh; do NOT recognise Armenia as having occupied any territories; do NOT demand any withdrawals by Armenia from any territories. 

> - Same as above applies to the only existing non-binding UN General Assembly [resolution](https://undocs.org/A/RES/62/243) which [was rejected](https://www.osce.org/mg/49564) by the OSCE co-chairs (US, France and Russia) for attempting to bypass the Un-mandated OSCE process to determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The majority of states also abstained from voting in favour of said resolution.

> - The [ceasefire agreement of 1994](https://twitter.com/hnikogh/status/719245054125207552/photo/2) had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.

> - This is an authoritative [map of Nagorno Karabakh](https://twitter.com/Tom_deWaal/status/1311246496348725250/photo/1) with the surrounding territories with original place names courtesy of Thomas de Waal.

> - The [Crisis Group's Karabakh Conflict Visual Explainer](https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-visual-explainer) has a detailed timeline of the conflict.

> - Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Artsakh Republic are synonymous as per the constitution of the de facto republic. 

> **Is there a peace plan?**

> -  Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to the following peaceful resolution plan proposed by the UN-mandated OSCE Minsk Group, aka the [Basic Principles](https://www.osce.org/mg/51152): 

>   - return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; 

>   - an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

>   - a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

>   - future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

>   - the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence;

>   - international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

> - OSCE Minsk Group peace [agreement document](https://www.aniarc.am/2016/04/11/madrid-principles-full-text)

> - US Department of State in-depth [discussion of conflict resolution](https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/averting-all-out-war-nagorno-karabakh).

> - Entities backing the OSCE peace plan: [UN General Secretary](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-09-27/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict), [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/escalation-of-violence-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/), [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/azerbaijan/news/article/situation-in-nagorno-karabakh-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign), [EU High Rep Foreign Affairs](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/85862/Nagorno%20Karabakh:%20Statement%20by%20the%20High%20Representative/Vice-President%20Josep%20Borrell),  [NATO Sec. General](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm), [Council of Europe Sec. General](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/nagorno-karabakh-secretary-general-calls-for-immediate-end-to-hostilities)

> **Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

> - UK-based Conciliation Resources helped Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists to jointly produce a neutral documentary where everything you see and hear is agreed by both parties, [watch it online here](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict). Tom de Waal's Black Garden book is considered to be a comprehensive and balanced work on the conflict.

Both their officer corps were products of Soviet military education and presumably fought using the same tactics and strategy they were trained in under the USSR.

According to Wikipedia at least the Azeri side had much more equipment and a much larger population. It rather vaguely cites more experience on the part of the Armenians but doesn't go into much detail. 

Why were the Armenians able to win despite the two armies having similar force-structures, but the Armenians have material inferiority relative to the Azeris?",1

9/26/2023,"A blast in Nagorno-Karabakh injures more than 200, while thousands flee to Armenia","An explosion at a fuel storage facility in the Nagorno-Karabakh region wounded over 200 people and prompted thousands to flee to Armenia.


**The Cause and Effect:**  The blast took place at a fuel storage site near Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, and reportedly injured over 200 people.
* The cause of the blast is yet to be determined, but it occurred while locals were lining up for fuel to leave the region.
* Many of the victims were described as being in ""severe or extremely severe"" condition, necessitating air evacuation for medical treatment.


**Political Background:**  The explosion followed a quick offensive by Azerbaijan last week, reestablishing their control over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region after three decades of separatist rule.
* Thousands of ethnic Armenians fled to Armenia, fearing reprisals following the handover.
* As per Armenia's government, more than 6,500 Nagorno-Karabakh residents have sought refuge, while Russian peacekeepers in the region have helped in the evacuation.


**International Response:**  Nations and organizations worldwide have expressed their concern and offered aid in response to the situation.
* French President Emmanuel Macron pledged assistance in terms of food and medical aid for Nagorno-Karabakh and vowed to work towards a ""sustainable peace"" in the region.
* The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Samantha Power, visited Armenia to show U.S. support for Armenia's sovereignty and independence and assist in addressing humanitarian needs caused by recent violence.
* The UN also expressed its worry over the increase in influx into Armenia and offered to provide assistance and conduct humanitarian needs assessments if permitted access to the region.


**The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh:**  The Nagorno-Karabakh region, disputed by Armenia and Azerbaijan, has seen decades of conflict since Armenian-backed forces took control in 1994.
* Azerbaijan recently reclaimed the area and accused the Armenian government of using a key road for illegal activities, leading to a 10-month blockade.
* Turmoil continues as Russia's efforts to maintain peace in the region are questioned, and Turkish President Erdogan declares support for its ally Azerbaijan.

&#x200B;

A new kind of warfare has taken the world by storm this year. While most of us were preoccupied with the election, the coronavirus, and the other exciting events that have taken place over this year when decades happen, a small number of people have kept a close watch on distant battlegrounds in the Middle East; where the face of war has changed since January in ways that few would have predicted--and with it the region as a whole.

&#x200B;

# 1. In the Beginning

But let's go back a ways; to the ancient world of circa 1980. Drones were not a new technology in any sense of the word--but they weren't particularly of interest beyond hobbyists, [target drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Firebee), and occasional odd military projects like the [D-21 reconnaissance drone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_D-21). However, things were changing with the introduction of digital cameras and increasingly capable processors and transmitters as computers rapidly developed--and so it was only a matter of time before someone took advantage of that. That someone was the Israelis. Israel has a high level of technical expertise, large defense needs, but a relatively small industrial base, so it often pioneers technologies of this sort, and so it did with the [Tadiran Mastiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadiran_Mastiff).

&#x200B;

This innovation quickly proved to be of significant utility in the First Lebanon War. Besides spotting Yasser Arafat, leader of the PLO, they played a crucial role in the still-infamous [""Bekaa Valley turkey shoot""](https://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Operation-Mole-Cricket-19-456909) in which Israeli aircraft supported by UAVs destroyed a massive quantity of top-of-the-line Soviet hardware--almost 90 Syrian aircraft and 29 surface-to-air missile batteries at the total loss of minor damage to a pair of F-15s and one UAV shot down. Electronic warfare and AWACs control also proved crucial in this conflict, which in many ways paved the way for the successes of Desert Storm and the 2003 Iraq invasion; and reportedly shattered the self-confidence of the Soviet Union in its air defenses.

&#x200B;

Since that first incident; UAVs have become an increasingly prominent part of the arsenal, particularly of the United States; though Israel and China also manufacture numerous UAVs and theirs are more popular in the export market due to lower prices and fewer scruples about ""human rights"" or ""political stability"". UAVs have become key reconnaissance assets and popular for precision-strike counter-insurgency missions. However, neither the United States nor China can claim credit for the latest developments--and Israel, at best, has played a peripheral role. The nation that everyone is watching now is Turkey.

&#x200B;

# 2. Turkey

For most of history, Turkey; or at least the geographical area of Anatolia, was a great power of some shape or another. The modern Turkey, however, rejected the idea of empire and foreign adventurism under Ataturk; the father of the Republic. While it has generally tended towards the West--directed in that way both softly by the allure of Europe and drive for modernization; and with great force by the military, which has tended to depose any government that even hinted at reintroducing religious or Middle Eastern aspects back into the aggressively secular Republic, Turkey has not been a particularly major player in the past century. Despite joining NATO for protection against the Soviet Union--which despised Turkey's chokehold on the Bosporous--it never had much appetite for interventionism.

&#x200B;

In the era of the ""Great Convergence"", where nations seem to be returning to historical norms of influence and power, it should be no real surprise then that Turkey has become more assertive. It has grown much wealthier thanks to its association with Europe; and that wealth is actually created by the Turks, not dug up out of the ground like it is in much of the Middle East. It is more educated; more progressive \[this of course being a rather relative term\] and, importantly, much better at fighting, than most of its neighbors.

&#x200B;

[Turkey has been working to build a domestic armaments industry with great success](https://www.defensenews.com/native/turkish-defence-aerospace/2020/07/21/how-turkey-became-one-of-the-worlds-leading-manufacturers-of-weapons-systems/)\--barring a handful of key items like jet engines which hardly anyone can manufacture well, Turkey can do most things. In between indigenous development and picking up knowledge from South Korea, China, Ukraine, and so on, Turkey has one of the world's better arms industries--I'd say it's about reached the level that South Korea was at ten or twenty years ago, which is pretty good. Its drone program, however, started because of a different problem.

&#x200B;

The Turks wanted drones back in the early 2000s for what we in the business call ""reasons"". Evidently the United States saw through this; because, despite allowing Turkey to license-assemble F-16s and build parts for the F-35, [it did not sell Turkey drones for fear that they would be used against the Kurds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-05-22/turkish-bid-for-drones-stalls-in-congress-president-gul-says)\[a perception that proved to be correct as Turkey has indeed used its UAVs against Kurdish insurgents\]. As a result, Turkey decided to do it themselves, and started building up their own drone program from scratch. By the beginning of 2020, Turkey had a large drone program and advanced electronic-warfare equipment. But nobody was really paying attention to their drone program; it was a sideshow of limited interest compared to the big players, that would presumably be of some utility but not a game-changer. I mean, their premiere drone literally used an engine made for homebuilt aircraft and was the size and weight of a smart car. Nothing too impressive. That is, until January.

&#x200B;

# 3. Libya

The Libyan conflict is a deeply convoluted one that is difficult to explain. In essence; Libya has been in some sort of civil war since Gaddafi was deposed in 2011, but the most recent division is between the GNA, or Government of National Accord--the UN-recognized government of Libya located in Tripoli--and the ""Tobruk Government"" which acts as a rubber-stamp body for Gaddafi wannabe General Haftar. Haftar started off this year with things looking pretty good. After breaking the second cease-fire agreement in as many years, flush with cash and support from the United Arab Emirates, Russia, and France, Haftar was on the move, pushing for Tripoli itself. It was going to take a while, but nothing could stop Haftar from defeating the ragtag GNA militias.

&#x200B;

Nothing, that is, until Turkey unexpectedly showed up because of a completely different dispute over rights to the seas around Cyprus. Libya \[the GNA to be precise\] was willing to delineate its boundary with Turkey in a way which cut off Greek and Cypriot claims, and, in return, Turkey arrived after a highly contentious vote in the normally placid Turkish Grand National Assembly, with Syrian mercenaries in tow; but also a large number of drones--mostly the [Bayraktar TB2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayraktar_TB2)\-- and [KORAL land-based standoff jammers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KORAL_Electronic_Warfare_System).

&#x200B;

What happened next was a deep humiliation for Russia in particular. Russia and the UAE had supplied General Haftar with a number of its premiere short-range air defense system, the much-vaunted [Pantsir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantsir_missile_system) which was designed to shoot down UAVs, cruise missiles, and other small munitions. Unfortunately, the Pantsir proved much worse at shooting down Turkish drones than serving as target practice for them. [Estimates suggest 23 systems were destroyed](https://www.defenseworld.net/news/27161/Some_23_Russian_Pantsir_Air_Defense_Systems_Destroyed_in_Syria__Libya__Reports) \[Turkey even captured one system and presumably picked it apart for intelligence\] while [perhaps \~16](https://dronewars.net/2020/07/01/libyan-war-sees-record-number-of-drones-brought-down-to-earth/) Bayraktar TB2 drones were destroyed--which doesn't sound terrible until one remembers that those drones caused significantly more destruction than the air-defense systems and come in at a third of the price; and becomes even less favorable when one realizes that as the conflict went on the ratio flipped increasingly in favor of the Turks. Ultimately, the Turks achieved their goal, with Haftar being pushed back to Sirte and another cease-fire agreement being signed. This conflict, however, has contributed significantly to the increasing rift between France and Turkey, and their respective relations with Russia.

&#x200B;

# 4. Syria

Russia likes to test its luck--to see what exactly it can get away with. Invading Crimea, shooting down a civilian airliner, attempting to murder exiles with Novichok. Often, it does get away with it. But when nations actually push back, they often find great weakness--for instance, the infamous incident where [Americans killed 200 Russian ""mercenaries"" in Syria](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/world/middleeast/american-commandos-russian-mercenaries-syria.html) after Russia denied they were Russian soldiers, or when American cyberwarriors [shut down Russian trolls during the 2018 election](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cyber-command-operation-disrupted-internet-access-of-russian-troll-factory-on-day-of-2018-midterms/2019/02/26/1827fc9e-36d6-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html). Nowhere is this more illustrated than in Syria, where, early this year, [a ""Syrian"" airstrike killed 29 Turkish soldiers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrian-airstrike-kills-at-least-22-turkish-soldiers-in-idlib-turkish-official-says/2020/02/27/f3bb8a3a-59a0-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html) even though Russian involvement was an open secret.

&#x200B;

What followed was not the usual vague condemnation and angry letter-writing that one might have expected. Instead, Turkey responded with a substantial escalation of force, again largely done by drones. Ultimately, around 200 Syrian government soldiers were killed in this short offensive--along with 45 tanks, 33 artillery pieces, 33 transport/utility vehicles, 20 armored vehicles, a pair of Su-24 aircraft that attacked a Turkish drone, and several SAM systems, which again proved largely ineffective against Turkish drones. While the conflict stopped before it went any further, the lesson was clear: Turkey was willing to escalate beyond where Russia was willing or able to respond, and there wasn't anything they could do about it.

&#x200B;

Besides having a nice moral--extremely hard pushback is the best way to respond to Russian provocation, because they aren't expecting it and can't fight back [since they lack effective escalation methods](https://preview.redd.it/s66ngo305by51.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=91b8d2ac1b82225686e9c0c08ef80fb5573a00e5)\--this conflict proved again that Turkish drones were highly effective even against a state actor \[albeit a weak one, like Syria\]. The world watched--but nowhere else as closely as Azerbaijan.

&#x200B;

# 5. Artsakh

Artsakh is; or perhaps more aptly *was,* an Armenian state--not recognized by any other state--within the borders of the former Azerbaijan SSR. It emerged out of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, one of the nastier conflicts resulting from the breakup of the Soviet Union. In short; the Soviet Union put an ethnically Armenian area in the Azerbaijan SSR that was semi-autonomous; called Nagorno-Karabakh, that Armenians viewed as rightfully part of Armenia. When the Soviet Union broke apart--even before it had done so completely--Armenia and Azerbaijan were already engaging in low-level fighting; and in scenes reminiscent of the Partition of 1949, Azeris living in Armenia fled the country--as did their Armenian counterparts in Azerbaijan. 

&#x200B;

Then, as the Soviet Union properly collapsed, both sides geared up for war. The Soviet Union had left quite a lot of stuff lying around as it collapsed; and Azerbaijan ended up with the bulk of it due to the disposition of Soviet forces. Both sides bought black-market weapons and armaments from conscript soldiers in the confusion of the the collapse. And then they went to war.

&#x200B;

The result was a years-long, brutal conflict that killed tens of thousands of people--in two relatively small countries--and, despite Azerbaijan having more equipment, more men, and more foreign support--from Turkey, which never had much love for Armenia and was building ties with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia \[of whom the Azeris are one\], and from Israel, who saw a potential new partner in a dangerous region. Armenia had some support from Russia, largely due to connections through a shared religion, nervousness about the Turks, and feelings among the Russian elite that were more sympathetic to Armenia. 

&#x200B;

However, against all odds, the Armenians emerged victorious. In 1994, with the Armenians poised to break out of the mountains and attack the heart of Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan exhausted from years of war, a cease-fire was signed.

&#x200B;

From that day onwards; both nations began preparing for the return of conflict. It was only a matter of time. Armenia had not only taken Nagorno-Karabakh, they had taken large portions of ethnically Azeri land as well, including sites that were of paramount cultural and historical importance to the Azeris. They also engaged in ethnic cleansing, and to this day Azerbaijan, at least nominally, has hundreds of thousands of refugees from the conflict. 

&#x200B;

In the intervening years, however, things changed. In particular; Turkey rose to a newfound regional prominence, and Azerbaijan, though being careful to always maintain a measure of proximity to Russia sufficient to not cause its rulers concern, slowly drifted towards Turkey and Israel. Ties with Turkey stretched to [a mutual defense agreement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_Strategic_Partnership_and_Mutual_Support) [Ties to Israel included offering potential basing in Azerbaijan](https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/03/28/israels-secret-staging-ground/), the sale of oil \[not many nations would sell Israel oil until recently\] along with shadowy intelligence connections--Mossad operations in Iran are believed to be launched out of Azerbaijan \[for a number of reasons, Iran and Azerbaijan don't like each other very much\]. And Azerbaijan, noted for its oil reserves as far back as the Second World War; collected large revenues which it sunk into military spending. Meanwhile, Armenia, despite making large purchases from Russia, fell behind in military readiness, and in its economy--not helped by the fact that, because of a mix of pro-Azeri Turkish policy and Armenian distrust and even hatred of Turkey \[thanks to the fact that Turkey argues over whether even discussing ""those unfortunate events of 1915"" is okay\], the Turkish border remains closed--meaning that trade can only go via Iran or Georgia. 

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, the peace process dithered on, with occasional small skirmishes breaking out. The regular theme was that Armenia would hand over the Azeri-majority \[now unoccupied\] territory it captured, and Nagorno-Karabakh would, in return, be recognized, or become autonomous, or something of the sort. The Minsk Group led these efforts; though not particularly well--all three members had significant biases. The Russians were pro-Armenian though not anti-Azeri \[mostly, they were in favor of the status quo, which favored them\], the French were pro-Armenian \[on account of disliking Turkey and having a politically influential Armenian population much like the Cubans in Miami\], and the Americans were sufficiently pro-Azeri that [they created manuals like this](https://wss.apan.org/3084/Decisive%20Action%20Training%20Environment/DATE_3.0.pdf) and defending the fictional nation of Atropia \[*which just happens* to be an oil-rich, pro-Western autocracy that is exactly where Azerbaijan is\] against foreign invaders [became a meme among the US military](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/6znkzk/after_multiple_invasions_the_us_army_is_getting/dmwki31?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\--you can buy [""Atropia Veteran""](https://www.google.com/search?q=atropia+veteran&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwieuOH0so_tAhWNwVkKHfu0D7YQ_AUoAnoECA4QBA&biw=1920&bih=966) swag, and it became so transparent that Europeans complained about ""defending autocrats"" in the exercise and Turkish officials complained that ""Limaria"" \[Armenia\] included areas that should have been in ""Kemalia"" \[Turkey\]. 

&#x200B;

Ultimately, by 2020, a few things had changed. After victory in clashes in 2016, and purchases of new arms, Azerbaijan was confident that it wouldn't fail due to military incompetence like last time. Armenia had elected a new leader, more distant from Russia \[especially since he came to power in a 'color revolution'\], complicating any Russian response. Not only that, but Armenia had begun settling in territory that was formerly ethnically Azeri, and had attempted to rewrite history so the land they had taken was somehow always Armenian, making a land swap less tenable--especially after the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh was renamed to the Republic of Artsakh. Domestic protests about a lack of action on the issue further spurred action, but perhaps the most decisive factor was Turkey's drone-fueled rampage and Russia's no good, very bad year elsewhere \[from the domestic economy to the chaos in Belarus\]. 

&#x200B;

So at the end of September 2020, they went to war.

&#x200B;

# 6. Curb-stomp battle

[Course of the conflict by Liveuamap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_war_every_day_\(Liveuamap\).webm)

&#x200B;

Initially, the war looked like it was serious, but not out of line with previous escalations. Azeri and Armenian forces clashed along the border--but then Azerbaijan made a major incursion along the southern border, which is flat and nearly completely unpopulated, and through the rest of the war pushed through there until they ultimately cut the single road leading to Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia when they recaptured Shusha. At that point, Armenia capitulated.

&#x200B;

While the exact details of why this happened are of relatively little importance, what does matter is what drones did. Armenian air defenses proved completely defenseless against the onslaught of Azerbaijan, with even larger and heavier systems like Russia's S-300 being destroyed by Turkish-manufactured drones. [Even the An-2, a literal Soviet 1940s cropdusting biplane, proved lethal to air defenses when rigged with the right equipment](https://www.overtdefense.com/2020/10/05/azerbaijan-reportedly-convert-ancient-an-2-biplanes-into-drones/). 

&#x200B;

As a result, Azerbaijan swept across Armenian forces with drones, targeting anything larger than a bicycle, destroying tanks, artillery pieces, and surface-to-air-missile systems alike. While initially Azerbaijan didn't advance, they pursued a strategy of attrition against Armenian forces--and were quite successful at it. Nowhere was safe for Armenian infantry--even miles behind the front, drones were still a risk. After a few weeks of this, Azerbaijan began their offensive. This was interrupted by several ceasefires, the most successful of which lasted around fifteen minutes. 

&#x200B;

In the meantime, Armenia and Azerbaijan engaged in tactics reminiscent of the War of the Cities. Armenians made rocket attacks on Azeri civilian targets, and even [ballistic missile strikes with SCUDs and Tokchas against Ganja](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/17/13-killed-in-gan), an Azeri metropolis, with later attacks also taking place against Barda and other targets. Virtually all sources agree that Armenia conducted a deliberate policy of targeting civilians in retaliation from the advance of Azerbaijan. 

&#x200B;

Azerbaijan, meanwhile, adopted what I would characterize as a callous indifference to Armenian civilian lives. We have relatively little documentation on exactly what they did, but it is likely that major war crimes were committed against Armenian prisoners. However, we do know that [rockets and cluster munitions were used against civilian areas of Stepanakert.](https://apnews.com/article/europe-azerbaijan-armenia-2a63dad13bcdb456030e19221bdfbd2d) By and large, though, Azerbaijan's government is mindful of global sensitivities and would rather avoid making itself a bigger villain than it has to be. 

&#x200B;

# 7. Ending

By the first week of November, despite appearances, it had become clear Armenia was losing. While they still held most of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, Azeri forces were rapidly closing in on the major road \[1 of 2\] that connects Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia proper. Armenian forces were demoralized and lacked heavy equipment. Civilians fled; with most of the population of Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, fleeing before the road was cut. Analysts had few doubts that, within another few weeks, before winter arrived, Azerbaijan could take all of Nagorno-Karabakh.

&#x200B;

But fortunately, several factors coincided. First, Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan realized the situation Armenia was in, and presumably began talking about peace. President \[and resident dynastic autocrat\] of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev had achieved most of the territorial gains he wanted, but as far as I can tell had little to no interest in making his country notorious for what would surely be the ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of people. Russia was interested in making sure that *any* deal possible happened that could salvage its privileged position in the region. And since Azerbaijan had acheived its major goals, Turkey was alright with suing for peace as well.

&#x200B;

The final impetus was provided by the Azeris taking Shusha, the second-largest city in the region \[and one of tremendous cultural importance to the Azeri people\], and, at around the same time, the Azeris accidentally shooting down a Russian attack helicopter on the border. 

&#x200B;

The ultimate deal was *incredibly* favorable to the Azeris, which should be expected given that they could have taken the rest of the region with relative ease. It involved [Armenia vacating most of Nagorno-Karabakh](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/10/21558428/armenia-azerbaijan-war-nagorno-karabakh-russia-turkey) and all the ethnically Azeri land they had taken, bar the Lachin Corridor. Of particular importance to Turkey, and to the Azeri economy, was that the deal created a corridor through Armenia to Azerbaijan's western exclave, and hence to Turkey, for transit. While still an indirect route, it is nowhere near as difficult as traveling around through Georgia. Russia also got to pretend like it still mattered by deploying a few thousand peacekeepers for what seems likely to be a limited time.

&#x200B;

Azerbaijan celebrated. As far as anyone was concerned, they had won. Turkey also celebrated--they had, in their view, not only supported the Turkic Azeris in a victory against the Armenians, but also won a battle against Russia to see whom was the real dominant power in the Caucasus. Russia didn't celebrate, but felt that it had at least maintained some sort of influence in the region when initially things looked like they might ultimately sideline Russia entirely. Armenia, however, unsurprisingly, was enraged, and rioters smashed government buildings and forced Prime Minister Pashinyan into hiding; however, it looks like the Armenians realize that they really had no chance of winning and aren't going to resume the conflict.

&#x200B;

# 8. What Now?

In a strange twist of fate, there is some speculation that peace is now *more* likely than it was before the war. In particular, some think that Turkey will be interested in finally coming to terms with the Armenians and opening its border with Armenia--which would significantly reduce Russian influence in the region and promote economic development--and some speculate that Azerbaijan may now be willing to make a lasting peace deal since it has, essentially, all that it wants. 

&#x200B;

This war chronicles one of this year's themes--the decline of Russia, and rise of Turkey. I would expect to see more conflict between them in the future, and I'd expect to see, in a strange historical irony, Turkey coming out on top. Russia has not had a very good year at all and I think this conflict is really just the latest example of how far it has fallen in its military capabilities and political influence despite what Putin shows off. 

&#x200B;

Small drones are now the obsession of every military planner, as is trying to figure out a way to shoot them down reliably. Already a number of nations have expressed interest in buying the Turkish drones that had such a decisive impact on these conflicts. It seems likely that this will especially transform lower-end conflicts where foreign powers can now intervene without risking more than a few million dollars in equipment, and where local powers can now field their own drones and precision-guided munitions while being, for the moment, largely unopposed. 

&#x200B;

Whatever the ultimate impact, though, it is undeniable that this change in warfare has been one of the more important and interesting bits of 2020 thus far, though it's behind some truly massive things. Unlike the coronavirus, or Donald Trump, however, these trends are probably with us to stay for a while. I don't think we've heard the last of the drone-warfare revolution yet.",1

Azerbaijan de jure controls a majority Armenian territory where the de facto unrecognized state of Nagorno-Karabakh exists. Naturally Armenia would like to have this territory. 

However when you add international politics into the mix is makes very little sense. Apparently Armenia is supported by both Russia and the US while on the other side Azerbaijan is supported by Turkey and Turkey is an ally of the US. Also the president of Azerbaijan is friends with Lukashenko of Belarus, a nation which is basically Russia’s best friend right now. 

Am I simply misunderstanding the level of US relevance in this conflict? Here in the US it seems that everyone supports Armenia, citing the Armenian genocide and a very large Armenian population with enough influence to sway the country in their favor.",1

And it's not only their 2008-2013 scandal(including a probably rigged win). Azerbaijani jury in 2015(and other years) was suspicious and so were their results (10 points from a country in semis becoming a 12 in the final and from countries who have zero connection to Azerbaijan whatsoever). In 2022 teaming up with 5 countries to rig the result and making it to the final with 0 televoting points and so much more. Don't get me wrong it's not the only country that has had suspicious results, but it's certainly the only one that keeps doing it and EBU lets it get away. It seems like it's being toned down but we all know whatever they do, EBU won't ban them cause...money

Ps: I also think Azerbaijan doesn't fit in a contest promoting unity and peace when they've been keeping this attitude, to say the least, towards Armenia. But that's a long story and i don't wanna get into it, i just wish to enjoy a contest where there is fairness",1

10/15/2023,We won't visit Azerbaijan anymore - Sorry Azerbaijan,"I was considering visiting Azerbaijan in the future, but my plans have been permanently canceled. Me and my wife and friends will no longer visit your country for tourism. Azerbaijan is supporting racist Zionist apartheid against Palestinians, and that's just disgusting. I thought you guys were Muslims, and had solidarity with other Muslim countries. Now I see that this country has nothing to do with Islam or Muslims. What was the most shocking was seeing the Zionist apartheid flag waving above the capital in Baku.

Azerbaijan should just call itself a Jewish country at this point. It doesn't make sense to advertise yourself as a Muslim country, but to not follow anything from Islam. This only seems like trademark infringement.

I will tell everyone who is interested in your country to not visit Azerbaijan. I have so far changed many people's plans who were interested in seeing your country. I am proud that Azerbaijan will get less tourists and less money, as they deserve.

PS, I am a white European. I'm not an ""Islamist"" or an Arabic person.",1

####Welcome to the Day after Debrief discussion thread!

Now that the dust has settled in Baku, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Problem is, it is missing 'authoritarian' and 'hereditary dictatorship', which exists in the Syria (Assad family), Turkmenistan and North Korea (Kim Family) articles. Of course the world is well aware of Assad and Kim! For those who aren't aware, Azerbaijan has had the same president Aliyev since 2003, which he inherited from his father, who came to power in the 1990s. Also Aliyev's wife is vice-president!! Country is beyond nepotistic, corrupt and authoritarian. No election has been deemed as free and fair, the opposition is heavily controlled and monitored in election cycles (similar to the situation in Russia under Putin).

I don't know who watches this article, but they are doing an absolutely horrible dishonest job, and my requests on the talk page for this edit to be made have been ignored. If Aliyev's article describes him as the most corrupt person of the year and a dictator, why doesn't the country's article have 'hereditary authoritarian dictatorship'? Shouldn't it be consistent and factual?

Since we are very obviously Muslim, are we more likely to be treated badly, scammed, targeted, that sort of thing?

Forgive me for my ignorance if this is not the case and thank you.",1

I was wondering what are Armenians thoughts on Iran helping Armenia maintain its sovereignty. 
Iran has offered time and time again to help Armenia with weapons, building base, doing joint military drill, etc.. but for some reason Armenia keeps denying.
Does the general population of Armenia not like Iran? A lot of iranian media is claiming right now that Iran wants to help Armenia more then Armenia wants to help itself. 

I would really like to understand, Thank you

3/15/2022,Minor Monday 50: Armenia,"Hello everyone, kergely here. I bring you a Minor Monday from KFateweaver, who wrote our last Progress Report.

\----------------Hey everyone, it’s KFateweaver, your faithful servant, back at it again with yet another Anatolian themed report. Today we’ll be taking a look at Armenia and its revolution. This content is supposed to be released as part of a regional update.

# The Armenian Revolution

During the Ottoman struggle against the rebellious Cairo Pact, the agitation brought by the war and the Iranian intervention will allow the Armenian rebels acting in Azerbaijan and to a lesser extent also in the Van area to take control of the province by toppling the local Turkish garrisons. Led by the famous revolutionary Garegin Nzhdeh, an Armenian nationalist with some rather extremist tendencies, [they will first try to ensure the survival of the insurgency by gaining some momentum](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952969390683488286/unknown.png). On that end, they will have some possibilities, including the development of the Armenian army and the stabilisation of the fragile alliance forged between the various forces of the Armenian political scene.

During this period, Nzhdeh will also be able to increase his control over the nation, allowing him to become more than a figurehead leader of the revolution in the near future. He can achieve this goal by centralising the army and by building a cult of personality around himself.

# After the Revolution

If the Armenian revolutionaries managed to withstand the Ottoman forces, there are basically two scenarios: Either Nzhdeh has succeeded in cementing his power (represented by the popularity of Paternal Autocrats being above 50%), or he has failed and the democrats managed to establish a democracy.

In both scenarios, [an economic tree will be unlocked](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952970178600247316/unknown.png). This tree will first be focused on rebuilding the country, and then on creating a new Armenian economy. The same goes for the military tree, which will obviously be focused on keeping the army in shape in order to defend the young country.

# The Tseghakronism/National Defence Path

If Garegin Nzhdeh managed to secure his control over the nation, there are two possibilities for the development of his political thought. If Russia is ruled by a National Populist party and Savinkov came to power, then Nzhdeh will see the Russian regime as an inspiration and try to fulfil his deepest political fantasies, and create a National Populist country. He will seek to create a totalitarian state based on the tribal and racial Tseghakron movement, which argues that Armenians should always come first and believes in the racial superiority of the Armenian people. Still, building this nation will not be a simple task, and his project can be knocked down if the Armenian democrats succeed at leaving the country and securing the support of an intriguing neighbour.

However, if Russia isn’t Savinkovist, then Nzhdeh won’t be able to fully apply his political thought, and will be limited to Paternal Autocrat. Instead, he will use his influence in the military and in the revolutionary Dashnak party to secure his power by forging an alliance between the two and by creating a special State Defence Organisation. [This path](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952969703133954098/unknown.png) will be focused on turning the Armenian nation into a stronghold that can defend itself even against superior foes.

# The Democratic Path

If Nzhdeh stayed a mere figurehead, then a “true” Armenian Republic will be declared by the democratic coalition. This coalition will be composed of both socialist revolutionaries and more moderate democratic parties. The first election will be between the socialist and democratic parts of the coalition. [If the socialists win](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952969852635725864/unknown.png), then they will organise a congress and choose the form of government they want. This will result in one of two parties taking the lead: Either the Hunchaks (Radical Socialists), a socialist revolutionary party under the leadership of Rouben Ter Minassian, or the Armenian Communist Party (Totalists), which will be led by Anastas Mikoyan.

Nevertheless,[if the democratic part of the coalition won the election](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923124477972344873/952970013671821312/unknown.png), it will thereafter organise a Presidential Election, in which either a candidate from the Ramgavar party or the famous and moderate Dashnak candidate Hovhannes Kajaznuni will be chosen. While the Ramgavar party (Market Liberals) advocates a liberal economy based on neoclassic thought, the Dashnaks (Social Democrats) support a more social economy. As for foreign policy, both of these parties will try to find a way to prevent external threats from invading the country by signing reconciliation treaties.

Finally, a picture of all possible Armenian leaders:

##war against Kemalist Turkey and Bolshevik Russia: ex-PM of Armenia and ex-mayor of Tbilisi Alexander Khatisian recalls the struggles for independence during the First Republic 

**KHATISIAN:** Upon my arrival in [Gyumri] I developed personal impressions of the situation at the frontline and the general mood in the population. The situation was sad. There was no enthusiasm. No one believed in our victory. 

We received a briefing from commanders from the Kars-Gyumri region. Our assaults on Turkish troops were unsuccessful. 

We proceeded to Yerevan. The city had its usual appearance. The railway traffic was slowed down to prioritize military trains. I met the political and military leadership to discuss the situation on the frontline.

Commanders Nazarbekyan and Hakhverdyan reported that despite the unsuccessful assault on Turkish forces, our army still had sufficient stamina. Simon Vratsyan had just arrived from Kars. He was under the impression that our forces were in a great mood but their commanders were weak and lacked leadership skills.

I asked the commanders how long Kars could withstand as a castle. They estimated two months. Upon learning details about the enemy army, I expressed my opinion that the war should continue. 

The council issued multiple orders to strengthen our defense. Everyone went home in a good mood. Kars was standing. Dro's forces were holding the enemy back in Surmalu. 

[...]

Our government was negotiating with the Soviet Union [Bolsheviks] to secure the most favorable conditions: 1) Independence for Armenia, 2) Annexation of Turkish-controlled Armenian vilayets. In return, Russia wanted to have all sorts of transit rights via Armenia. 

We were approaching the fateful day of October 30. But before that, let me share with you the memo sent to me by our diplomat Tigran Bekzadyan written in August 1920. It describes the situation on the ground.

##... the memo by BEKZADYAN, Armenia's ambassador to Georgia; classification: secret:

Your Excellency. It has become imperative for Armenia and Georgia to establish foreign relations with Bolsheviks after their invasion of Azerbaijan and the Northern Caucasus. The Russian government had hinted that they would respond favorably to Armenia's request for independence if Armenia offered a peace deal.

An Armenian delegation was dispatched to Moscow on May 5. *[apparently, it took 15 days to reach Moscow]*. Our goal was to convince Soviet Russia to recognize our independence, and not to intervene in our internal and foreign policies. These negotiations have not yielded any results so far.

There are several factors that contributed to these delays in negotiations, with the primary ones being:

(1) Kemalists [Turkey] are fighting against the Entante states and the peace agreement [the West]. They want to receive assistance from Russia and Azerbaijan, by using Armenian lands. They view Armenia as an obstacle to creating a monotonous Muslim state stretching from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. Kemalists also want, with the help of Bolshevik Russia, to challenge the Western dominance in the East and Asia.

(2) Russia wants to establish a connection to Kemalist forces to use them to destroy Western capital and dominance in the East and Asia. Russia also wants to connect to Iran by using Armenian territories.

In both scenarios, Armenia is the main obstacle to the implementation of these programs. Lately, we've seen more attempts by Bolsheviks and Azeris to implement their plans. 

Kemalists and Azeris have focused on the borders with Armenia. On the other side, the Russian Bolsheviks, under the pretense of applying preventative measures to prevent the Armenian-Azeri conflict from causing international clashes, have invaded Karabakh, Syunik, and Nakhijevan. The Kemalist-Azeri forces have also entered these regions. 

But that didn't last long, and the Bolsheviks were pushed out. They proceeded to receive reinforcements from the Soviet army in Karabakh and the Kurdish cavalry from north-eastern Syunik. Our troops were outnumbered and were forced to retreat to Bazarcha/Sharur, where they were cornered and assaulted again from all directions by Bolsheviks, Kurds, Azeris, and Molokans. Dro's tiny army was unable to withstand.

Bolsheviks concentrated their forces near Gazakh [presumably Tavush region]. They assaulted unquestionably Armenian ~~regions~~ villages, invading several of them. This movement threatened to cut off our railway communication and completely neutralize it.

We passed this information to the Georgian government. The latter sent a note of protest to Moscow about its assault on Armenia. 

Concerned over the prospect of losing the aforementioned regions, the Armenian government decided to expedite the peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Bolsheviks demanded the three contested regions as a precondition for a ceasefire agreement. Armenia had no choice but to agree.

However, Armenia found it impossible to cede the aforementioned regions to Azerbaijan and expressed hope to reach an agreement through some kind of compromise. But if Azerbaijan, with the help of its allies [Bolsheviks and Kemalists], decides not to make any concessions and another armed conflict becomes inevitable, then it won't be Armenia's fault.

Armenia hopes that during these peace negotiations, our people will gain some peace, so we can organize the harvest and therefore the next military draft. In the meantime, our soldiers will have enough time to train to use the new weapons we received from England. Right now we need our soldiers to rest, arm themselves, and feel confident about the safety of their families.

These are the primary challenges we face today: 1) We are broke, 2) We don't have fuel, 3) We don't have means of transportation.

Your Excellency. The millions of dollars you've brought *[the diplomat is writing this letter to Alexander Khatisyan, who has just returned from a worldwide trip to collect cash and meet Armenian diaspora, basically 20th-century Himnadram]* ... the millions of dollars you've brought can help us overcome these unbearable conditions.

The government has decided to spare no means for defending our borders and rights. To this end, the government has announced new conscription throughout Armenia and coercive measures to strengthen the army. //

##Armenian-British military collaboration: 1918-1920

>Armenian-British military cooperation was on strong footing during the short life of the first Armenian Republic. 

>After independence, Armenia was an ally of Great Britain, a member of Entente. 

>This alliance is clear by the fact that Armenia continued to wage war against Turkey, which was among the most active opponents of Entente, and Turkish troops had suffered undisputed defeats and bypassed Armenia.

Georgia had claims over the Kars region, too. Population of Kars at the time: 123k Armenians, 103k Turks, 55k Kurds, 4k Georgians, ... Alexander Khatisyan visited Tbilisi, Georgia, to discuss the issue of Kars with General Walker, England’s supreme commander.

It ended with the border being drawn in the following way: 
 
>Ardahan Province’s northern part, above Ardahan city, the other side of the Poskov River, went to Georgia, and temporarily, the western part of Kars, from Merdenek westward, would stay under English command as a zone that directly shares a border with the state of Batumi. 

>the provinces of Kars and Kaghzvan, along with the Kars fort, as well as the city of Ardahan, were to be turned over to Armenia, which included the Alexdropol-Kars-Sarikamish-Karaurgan railroad. Oltisi Province, evidently, was to remain to the Turks.

England assigned Colonel Temperley to enforce the handover of territories to Armenians. English generals came to meet Armenian commander Dro and others to discuss the deployment of Armenian troops in Kars. There would be 1,200 Armenian and 3,000 English troops. Colonel Temperley was appointed as military governor, while Stepan Ghorghanyan was appointed civilian governor.

>it was a very big deal for Armenian forces to enter Kars. It was an occasion that created much enthusiasm among the people

The local Turkish governor [Shukra Pasha] refused to hand over power to the Armenian counterpart, so the English Colonel Temperley issued a warrant for his arrest. The guy was able to escape, however. Colonel Temperley summoned the rest of the Turkish militias and gave them 3 minutes to comply, which they did. 

The General of the Armenian army spent 6 weeks in London in 1919 to discuss military assistance. Great Britain’s foreign secretary Lord George N. Curzon continuously insisted on assisting Armenia. 

After the defeat of the White Army in Russia, Great Britain had doubts that Georgia and Azerbaijan could resist the Russian Red Army, but the foreign minister ""insisted in assisting the Armenian people, saying that Britain has a moral debt to pay the Armenian people.""

>Lord Curzon came forth with a special speech. After praising the bravery of Armenians, and insisting that they would be able to secure themselves if they are supplied with adequate weaponry, he went on to say that the suffering of the Armenians must be ameliorated, and promises by the warring nations towards the Armenians must be kept

Great Britain announced the preparation of assistance 7 days later.

**Prime Minister Lloyd George about Armenia:** It depends entirely on the Armenians themselves—whether they protect their independence. They must do so; they must begin to depend upon themselves. 

They are an exceptionally intelligent people. In fact, it is their intelligence that gets them into trouble sometimes, from all I hear. That is what is so obnoxious to the Turks. I am told that they could easily organise an army of about 40,000 men. 

If they ask for equipment we shall be very happy to assist in equipping their army. If they want the assistance of officers to train that army, I am perfectly certain there is no Allied country in Europe that would not be willing to assist in that respect. 

That is far and away the best thing for themselves. It would increase their self-respect. It would make them a manlier and more virile people. Instead of always casting themselves upon other countries and sending supplications and appeals, let them defend themselves. When they do so the Turk will have too much respect—not for them, but for himself—to attempt any more massacres in that quarter. //

Later, artificial obstacles were created by Great Britain's War Office. They decided to sell the weapons at a high price instead. Then they claimed issues with the delivery. Foreign minister Lord Curzon called it unacceptable and summoned meetings. 

They finally agreed to send 48 field guns, 400 machine guns, 25,000 rifles, 40,000 units of military outfits, 1077 first aid kits, various military hardware, telescopes, compasses, gun repair kits, canned food, etc. 

The War Office demanded a hefty fee, to which Armenia agreed. On top of it, Georgia demanded 27% of the shipment as a transfer fee. Avetis Aharonian, chairman of the parliament of Armenia, expressed gratitude for the weaponry. There were also discussions to send 40 military advisors, on top of those who had already beein Armenia for 2 years, and aircraft. 

The head of the Armenian army, during his multi-week trip to London, visited factories to study the production of bullets. No equipment was subsequently purchased because Armenia was broke. Later they were supposed to send something, but the War Office blocked it again, citing unrest in Armenia and the Armenian government's decision to hold negotiations with Bolshevik Russia. Winston Churchill was concerned that British weapons could fall into the hands of the Bolsheviks.

There were efforts to move England's unused aircraft from Egypt to Armenia but the War Office blocked it again, citing Armenia's financial constraints and lack of expertise to use the aircraft. The Foreign Office was able to convince the War Office to supply aircraft, however. Many aviation experts began visiting Armenia. Armenia purchased 2 English airplanes.

>The quantity of the supplied weapons was very large for the Armenian army, and the cost in today’s value would be about 80 million British pounds, which is quite a significant loan amount for a single year even by today’s standard.

##Azerbaijani forces kidnap 3 ethnic Armenian students who were crossing the Azeri checkpoint illegally installed in Lachin corridor 

The students are professional soccer players who supposedly burned down the Azerbaijani flag as a sign of protest earlier. Azerbaijani authorities plan to charge them with ""disrespecting"" Azerbaijan. The students will remain under arrest for 10 days before being deported to Armenia. They will not be allowed to return back to their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh anymore. A protest was organized in front of the Russian embassy in Armenia for allowing the Azeri regime to kidnap the students.

The World Court had earlier ordered Azerbaijan to end the illegal obstruction of the 2-way movement through the Lachin corridor. Azerbaijan has not complied. 

**GOVERNMENT OF ARMENIA:** These kidnappings once again give reason to believe that Azerbaijan is planning to subject the entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh to collective punishment. 

The entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh is deprived of all fundamental rights, food, medicine, gas, and electricity, while Azerbaijani snipers terrorize people, kidnap residents, and block the corridor to Armenia.

This demonstrates the true aspirations of the Azerbaijani leadership. They are avoiding dialogue with Nagorno-Karabakh at all costs and instead continue the policy of ethnic cleansing. //

##Commissioner for Human Rights at Council of Europe: Restore free movement along the Lachin Corridor and ensure the rapid and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance in Nagorno-Karabakh

**Dunja Mijatović:** Despite numerous calls by international stakeholders, the humanitarian and human rights situation in the area has further deteriorated due to the prolonged disruption in the movement of people and access to food supplies and urgent medical care.

The relevant stakeholders should immediately find a solution to avoid any further deterioration of the very dangerous situation.

I confirm my readiness to engage with all the relevant interlocutors and to travel to Nagorno-Karabakh to assist in overcoming the existing human rights challenges.

##Public International Law & Policy Group's report on Nagorno-Karabakh: External self-determination via remedial secession

>The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth the argument that the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh are entitled, at a minimum, to the right of internal self-determination and that the current negotiations should provide for the meaningful and effective protection of this right. 

>As such, Nagorno-Karabakh’s Soviet-era autonomous status should serve as a benchmark for discussions between Armenia and Azerbaijan concerning the future fate and status of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

The report analyzes the pre-1990 mistreatment of ethnic Armenians by Azerbaijani authorities:

>Prior to 1988, Azerbaijan's human rights record with respect to the
Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh was rather dismal. During the seven decades of the USSR's existence, the government of Soviet Azerbaijan conducted a systematic policy of repression and removal of Karabakh Armenians from their historic homeland. 

>During this time, the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh was reduced from ninety-five percent of the total population of the
region in 1926, to seventy-five percent of the population in 1976. 

>In the nearby Azerbaijani-administered enclave of Nakhichevan, the Armenian population was reduced from 40% of the population to zero. 

>Subsequent to the Karabakh movement for independence in 1988, the human rights violations against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh intensified, including “pogroms, deportations, and other atrocities.”

Conclusion:

>In the event that Azerbaijan refuses to accept that Nagorno-Karabakh’s
Soviet-era autonomous status be included on the agenda and serve as a benchmark for discussions between Armenia and Azerbaijan concerning the future fate and status of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, this is a clear signal of a continued rejection of that right for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, and this opens the door to the possibility of external self-determination via remedial secession

##Nagorno-Karabakh president changed his mind and refused to resign after learning that Gen. Samvel Babayan could become the next leader: journalist Tatul Hakobyan reveals details 

Context: It was claimed that Arayik Harutyunyan had promised to resign but broke the promise under unknown circumstances. Journalists Tatul Hakobyan and Petros Ghazaryan discuss the events.

**TATUL:** First of all, Russia's 14-point document [that outlines the subjugation of ethnic Armenians to Azerbaijani rule] is an authentic paper. Moscow passed it to Stepanakert through Yerevan. Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians are joking that they wished it was written by Azerbaijan so it would have more favorable terms. It's great that people maintain their sense of humor.

**PETROS:** Let's discuss the situation around the resignation of Nagorno-Karabakh president Harutyunyan.

**TATUL:** During the closed-door meeting, Harutyunyan complained about Russia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, and announced that he can no longer manage the crisis. He said he would resign but ended up not doing so. Here is what happened...

They were supposed to nominate a new candidate for the presidency. The parliament would then elect the candidate as the new president. 

That's when Harutyunyan saw a threat of a takeover by Samvel Babayan because Harutyunyan's ruling party members, who hold the majority in parliament, declared that they would not necessarily vote in favor of the candidate nominated by Bako Sahakyan, Robert Kocharyan, or Ruben Vardanyan [the former regime]. They said they would vote freely.

Despite my rocky relations with Samvel Babayan, I think he is the only party that at least has proposed plans. The others aren't doing anything. 

**PETROS:** What is the ruling party's and Harutyunyan's plan? They rejected the initial negotiations, then they accepted it, then they wanted the negotiations to take place not here but there, and then they changed their mind and agreed.

**TATUL:** I agree. But if you place yourself in Harutyunayan's shoes, he is under immense pressure. 

**PETROS:** Does the former regime's candidate have a plan?

**TATUL:** I haven't heard anything. Their idea so far is to force the government out so they can come to power ""to solve the problems"".

##S&P upgrades Armenia from 'B+' to 'BB-' on robust growth and improved fiscal position; outlook stable

Spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine conflict helped Armenia's economy to expand significantly by 12.6%. The growth is expected to slow but remain at 7.5% in 2023. Armenia's IT sector has expanded by 51%, partly thanks to the migration of skilled Russian workers.

The worsening economy in Russia, the end of the migration-related benefits, and possible clashes with Azerbaijan could harm the economic growth, but the recent increase in human and financial capital could strengthen Armenia's potential growth rate. 

The average annual real GDP growth rate will be 4% until 2026.

**Information Point**

- Nagorno Karabakh does not have the status of an occupied territory.

- The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is pending the UN-mandated OSCE settlement agreed to by Azerbaijan based on the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.

- The UN-mandated OSCE non-optionally applies the principle of self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh.

- The UN-mandated OSCE is backed by France, Russia, US, UN, EU, NATO and Council of Europe among others. 

- All reputable international media refer to Nagorno Karabakh as disputed and do not use the term occupied.

- Nagorno Karabakh has been an officially bordered self-governed autonomous region since 1923 which de facto became independent from the Soviet Union before Armenia and Azerbaijan gained their independence.

- Nagorno Karabakh has had continuous majority Armenian presence since before Azerbaijan became a state in 1918 until today. Karabakh Armenians have their own culture, dialect, heritage and history going back millennia.

- The ceasefire agreement in 1994 had three signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh. 

- The UN Security Council resolutions do not recognise Nagorno Karabakh as occupied, nor demand withdrawals from Nagorno Karabakh, nor recognise Armenia as an invader, nor demand any withdrawals by Armenia, instead they mandate the OSCE to settle the conflict and determine the final status of Nagorno Karabakh.

10/4/2023,Gotta give it to Armenia for their legendary propaganda,"Hear me out
Let’s just put Karabakh proper aside right now
So Armenia 
1. Occupied Azeri territory that were never majority Armenian
2. Evicted all Azeri residents there
3. Striped resources from Azeri regions to build their city
4. Supported Russia’s invasion of Georgia 
5. Supported Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory 
6. Ruled by Russian oligarchs like Ruben 
7. Refused to condemn Russian invasions
8. Sabotaged peace talks and assasinated their leaders who wanted to sign a peace deal
9. Threatened to reach Baku
10. Friends with Iran



They screwed over absolutely everyone. There is not a single country involved here who has not been screwed over by Armenia. But for the love of Mickey Mouse and anime, they are somehow the victim in all of this. Everyone else, be it Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, EU, Israel, or the US, is either literally Hitler, or literally helping Hitler. 

Not only have they convinced the west of this, but in fact, they convinced them that anyone who doesn’t agree with this is paid off by Azerbaijan. So WE are the ones spreading propaganda.

2/21/2021,Andranik Ozanian (a National Hero of Armenia) vs Ramil Safarov (a superstar of Armenian propaganda),"Before giving you quotes about what exactly Andranik did to become a National Hero of Armenia, let me remind you that Andranik Ozanian is one of the main heroized persons of Armenia after whom the streets, schools and even a subway station were named in Armenia, add here monuments in every single Armenian town and his endless promotion in Armenian diaspora of US and Europe.

Also, let me remind you Ramil Safarov who became a ""National Hero in Azerbaijan"" (but only according to Armenian media) and a fact how Armenians condemned Erdogan for mentioning Enver Pasha in Baku Parade because Enver Pasha was a ""bloody person who killed thousands of innocent Armenians"".

So let's go:


From Robert Gerwarth, John Horne. War in Peace: Paramilitary Violence in Europe After the Great War. — С. 179.:

>""In 1918, Andranik rejected the Treaty of Batum as a Turkish dictate and moved to Zangezur with a paramilitary division estimated to have three to five thousands men, followed by many thousands of Ottoman Armenian refugees. In the self-proclaimed ""Republic of Mountainous Armenia"", comprising the multi-ethnic districts of Nakhichevan, Zangezur and Karabakh, Andranik's paramilitary units massacred and expelled the Azeri population.""

From Justin Mccarthy. The Ottoman Turks: An Introductory History to 1923. — С. 380.:

>""As a result of ethnic cleansing organized by Andranik, 180 thousand people, 2/3 of the Muslim population of the Erivan province, were massacred or expelled""

>""According to the report of the Zangezur district chief, there were cases when the Armenians asked Andranik to destroy certain villages - for example, according to his message of September 12, the villages of Rut, Darabas, Agadu, Vagudu were destroyed, and Arikli, Shukur, Melikly were also set on fire.  Pulkend, Shaki, Kiziljig, the Muslim part of Karakilisa, Irlik, Pakhlilu, Darabas, Kurtlyar, Khotanan, Sisian and finally Zabazdur, in which 500 men, women and children were killed"".

From Justin McCarthy. Death and Exile the Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims. — С. 215: 

>""To the President of the Parliament:
We ask you to inform the Minister of Internal Affairs of the following requirement: Is the Minister aware of the fact that during the past three weeks in the territory of the Armenian Republic within the boundaries of Echmiadzin, Erivan and Surmaly districts, a large number of Tatar villages, including Pashakend, Takarli, Kurukh-Giyun,  Ulalik of the Taishukhur society, Agveren, Dalelar, Purpus, Alibek of the Arzakend society, Dzhan-Fida, Kerim-Arch, Agjar, Igdalu, Karhun, Kelani-Aroltkh of the Echmiadzin district were cleared of the Tatar population and committed to robbery and massacre.  That the local police not only failed to prevent it, but took part in the robbery and massacre;  that these events left an imprint on the local population, which is disgusted with these pogroms, and who want to live in peace with their neighbors and demand that the criminals who have not yet been punished be brought to justice and punished.""

The telegram from Armenian commander Foma Nazarbekov to Armenian Parliament. From Justin McCarthy. Death and Exile the Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims. — С. 247.:

>""Please inform the Turkish commander that Andranik and his entire unit, who do not obey my orders and were dismissed from service, are committing really cruel actions against the population of the Nakhichevan region.""

From Richard G. Hovannisian, Armenia on the Road to Independence, Los Angeles, 1967, p. 194.:

>""The routes south were blocked by regular Turkish divisions. Backtracking, Andranik then pushed over Nakhichevan into Zangezur, the southernmost uezd of the Elisavetpol guberniia. Remaining there for the duration of the world war, Andranik's forces crushed one Tatar village after another.""


From Donald Bloxham. Interlude: The Genocide in Context // The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians.:

>""From mid-1918, Andranik was prominent in the destruction of Muslim settlements during the purging of the Armenian-Azeri border region of Zangezur. Hovannisian describes his actions as the beginning of the process of 'transforming Zangezur into a solidly Armenian land'. Alexandre Khatisian, one-time Prime Minister of Armenia, used similar language, averring that 'it was not the will of the diplomats which was to bring about homogeneous populations in this or that region, but through the course of elemental behaviour'. Andranik was stopped from expanding this policy into Karabakh by the local British commander, who had his own distinct political agenda.""


Andranik Ozanian became a National Hero of Armenia for reducing the percentage of Azerbaijani population of today's Armenia from 46% to 8% just within two years.",1
9/22/2023,What do the protesters/protest leaders reasonably expect from Pashinyan?,"I'm a neutral party in this conflict, but I'd like to understand this one thing. I ask this with all due respect.

* From watching him, it seems to me that Pashinyan has worked to try to modernize and democratize Armenia, get closer w/the West and bring peace through European and Democratic principles and diplomacy.
* Pashinyan also came to power *due to* massive protests and a Velvet Revolution - to get away from old school, corrupt/Soviet ways.
* For the reasons above, he was negotiating w/Azer. etc. trying to bring a peaceful resolution to the over century old conflict.
* Azerbaijan is way more powerful militarily than Armenia - w/Turkish financial and military support and their NATO weapons and training.
* By international law, Nagorny-Karabakh/Artsakh is recognized as Azeri territory (not saying it's right or not, just something playing against Armenia here).
* The West hasn't given much support to Armenia, and is now too occupied w/Ukrainian conflict.
* Russia, who is the biggest thing that resembles an ""ally"" (I put in quotes for a reason) to Armenia has all of its attention and resources occupied in Ukraine, as well as can't afford to upset Azer. and esp. Turkey, who they need for national interests, again due to war in Ukraine. Armenia has no other countries to back them.

What do these ""oppositionary"" leaders and protestors expect Pashinyan to do?

It seems that they want him to use the Armenian army to keep Karabakh/Artsakh from integrating into Azerbaijan - to what end? To have massive casualties in an all out war with a much more powerful force, and with Aliev in charge, possibly lead to end of not only Karabakh communities but the actual country of Armenia as well?

There's a good chance I'm missing something, which is what I'm trying to ask about here. Please no propaganda for any side, just objective reasoning. Thank you.

**Edit:** Do most people in Armenia support Pashinyan in the above? What about people in this sub? Do you agree that due to being helpless, ""giving away"" NK/Artsakh is needed to keep Armenia and citizens safe?

**Edit 2:** I also understand there is a lot of emotion involved, and respect the feeling of many ""just wanting to do something"" and not sit helplessly, I'm asking though objectively, and with a cool head, how can anyone expect the leader responsible for his State's and people within it safety to go into a war that would end Armenia and its people there?

10/4/2023,R/Armenia mod works for the Armenian Government?,"Hi everyone,

So one of the very active moderators of r/Armenia has accidentally given away his identity in several posts. He works for the Armenian Government and is a vocal supporter of Pashinyan and his policy of getting close to Turkey (he is probably from the Liparityan camp). This means that r/Armenia has essentially become an Armenian Government propaganda platform. Many users are not aware of this fact and think of r/Armenia as a neutral platform where they can get their daily information. My question is, is there something one can do about this? I consider this a huge problem with Reddit's 'anonymity', where government officials can disguise themselves as honest actors and push a specific agenda. Obviously this applies to Reddit as a whole, which has become a propaganda platform for the United States (there is a very good article about how certain American officials are now employed in high, decision-making positions in Reddit).

8/18/2023,Lachin road is not the only road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with the rest of the world.,"The claim that there is ""only one road in and out"" appears to be false propaganda. I counted an additional twelve roads going into and out of Nagorno-Karabakh. Thus alleged humanitarian crisis due to alleged closure of one road is literally impossible, as there are other roads to bring in supplies. 

Thanks to Armenia, the Agdam-Khankendi road proposed by Azerbaijan to transport humanitarian supplies to Karabakh Armenians was discussed at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. In a sense, what Azerbaijan had been trying to say to the world for the past eight months, Armenia accomplished in one week by dispelling the falsehoods of Lachin road being the ""only road to Karabakh"" and ""road of life.""

10/10/2023,"simple logic: If the Zangezur Corridor would genuinely benefit Armenia and make Armenia stronger, then Aliyev would not have proposed it in the first place, and Turkey and Russia would not support it"," 

The so-called economic benefits of the Zangezur Corridor are just Aliyev's bait. The so-called Zangezur Corridor won't bring actual benefits to Armenia; instead, it will worsen the security situation and provide Aliyev with a new pretext for war.

I can almost imagine what would happen if this corridor were actually opened and passed through Armenia. First, you would see a flood of so-called Azerbaijani refugees returning to find their homes, some of whom may be genuine, but most would likely be hired actors. Next, you would hear news of attacks on Turkish and Azerbaijani people on the Zangezur Corridor, and there might even be heartrending stories of Russians being harmed while protecting Turks and Azerbaijanis from Armenian terrorists. Subsequently, Turkey and Azerbaijan would demand police intervention, and regardless of what Armenia does, these two countries would not be satisfied.

Then there would be various propaganda, bots, and trolls spreading fake news online. News of Armenia tolerating domestic terrorist attacks on Turkic people would spread across the internet. Turkey and Azerbaijan would soon demand entry into Armenia to secure the safety of the caravans on the corridor and eliminate the security threats posed by terrorists. The justification would be that Armenia has an obligation to protect the corridor's security, and since it's now unsafe, Armenia has breached the agreement. Turkey and Azerbaijan should take responsibility for the security of this route. Meanwhile, public opinion among the people of these two countries would label Armenia as ungrateful, accusing it of extracting economic benefits while supporting terrorists.

Soon, there would be discussions of annexing southern regions of Armenia or even completely destroying Armenia. These areas would likely be recognized as Armenian territory by both countries, but the Armenian population there would undoubtedly leave voluntarily, much like how Turkish forces carried out ethnic cleansing of Kurds in Syria. Ironically, factions affiliated with Al-Qaeda, such as the Nusra Front, are currently cleansing Turkmen in Syria, but Turkey needs these people to counter the Kurds, so they turn a blind eye to the slaughter and expulsion of their own kin.

Facing reality, as long as Erdogan and Aliyev remain in power, any agreement reached with Turkey or Azerbaijan is inevitably reduced to scraps of paper. These despots do not care about the lives of their own compatriots, let alone the rights of Armenians or Kurds.

I personally support historical reconciliation and regional cooperation among the Caucasus nations, but this cannot happen under the rule of Aliyev, Erdogan, and those like them. These two individuals have trampled upon nearly every agreement they have signed. Any friendly gestures towards them may be seen as weakness. They only understand one language: strength, not economic cooperation and peace.",1

9/9/2023,“Western Azerbaijan” Propaganda history + origins,"First and foremost բարի օր to everyone!

So something that really interests me about Azerbaijan + Azeri society nowadays is this absolute hard-on they have for claiming the entirety of Armenia as their ancient and ancestral homeland. I find it mind boggling how after winning the 2020 war they’ve gotten so bold that mainstream Azeri news channels literally refer to our nation as West Azerbaijan. 98% of their population is on the edge of their seats hoping and praying that they annex us and “return to their lands”. I don’t mean the ones on reddit who claim that that’s not true, I mean the average joe you would pick off the street in Baku.  You would think they would put in more effort and propaganda into the whole “South Azerbaijan” thing considering theres literally 20 mil. of them in northern Iran where they’re the overwhelming majority. But now out of nowhere places like Armavir, Sevan, and Yerevan are their main interest. Why? 

And does anyone else find it weird how all of a sudden everyone in Azerbaijan has an ancestor that lived in Armenia? So I have a few questions I would like to have answered if any kind souls would want to take the time to do so:

1. Is the whole “West Azerbaijan” propaganda new, or did it exist during soviet and pre soviet times as well?

2. Being as unbiased as possible, what were the absolute max number of Azeris that lived in the borders of what is now modern Armenia in the past? To my knowledge the max it’s ever been is like 200k in the 1880’s (and Armenians were 900k). 

3. For any lurking Azeris, what’s your take on all this?",1

9/14/2023,Question to Armenians: would you accept the annexation of the current territory of Artsakh into Armenia as an exclave like Nakhchivan is with Azerbaijan?,"Not a troll or propaganda question, I asked a [similar question](https://reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/s/aCZLOI72PI) over in r/Azerbaijan just a foreigner who is just trying to understand the viewpoints of Armenians.      

I feel like an Armenian state that is not a part of Armenia makes no sense, so I genuinely don’t understand why the option of the Armenians in the Artsakh territory (not including the territories recaptured by Azeris in the 90s) let them join as a part of Armenia with a Lachin corridor (owned by Azerbaijan, controlled by Turkey) connecting it to Armenia proper and a Zangezur corridor (owned by Armenia, controlled by a foreign power like France or Russia or America) connecting Nahkchivan to Azerbaijan proper… to me this seems like the most logical solution that would result in long term peace and least problems. It is clear to me that the Armenians currently in Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh are unwilling to be a part of Azerbaijan, nor is Azerbaijan willing to host them as equals, so is this a solution you would accept? 

Please explain why this is or is not an acceptable solution in the comments, any response appreciated. Thank you 🙏",1

11/11/2020,Pashinyan's actions were much more brave and commendable than he is being given credit for,"Signing the agreement, ending the war, and stopping the killing of Armenian soldiers and civilians should have always been top priority. The man had the balls to admit defeat and lower himself to such low levels as to sign a deal with Azeris only to put a stop to the fighting and killing.

Those who oppose this deal have a point. He gave them what they wanted, he let them win, he rewarded their atrocious behavior. We did not get justice, the good didn't prevail. All that is true.

But, as a leader, his job is to look at the bottom line and to make the unpopular decision where it is necessary. Armenia was losing the war and never stood a chance. A small and poor country full of lions would still lose 2 big and rich countries full of hyenas and jackals.

The alternative would have been to keep fighting and letting more and more Armenian young men die to eventually lose the lands anyways and setting Armenia back another 50 years in progress. The priority now is to build a future for Armenia with or without Artsakh. This involves social services, education, technology, business, and military.

Edit:

It is very unfair to be cruel towards Diaspora Armenians. Over the years they have lobbied foreign governments, raised money, and helped Armenia a lot. It's one thing to have an ancestral homeland where one is born and raised, it is another to grow up in a place where you have to speak one language inside your home, and a different one when you go outside. Please be polite and fair towards your diaspora brothers and sisters and please do some critical thinking before believing every bit of idealized propaganda with regards to this subject.

Edit 2: 

I'd like to add some more thoughts. It is an absolute tragedy that we lost historic ancestral lands to the Azeris. It is also tragic that most of the residents of Artsakh probably don't want to return to their homes out of fear. My commentary above is only regarding the latest situation and resolution, not what happened in the past, but what was done given the most recent circumstances. At the end of the day, the signing of the agreement was to preserve the most important part of Armenia: its people. If we are going to make it into the future, we need our next generation who will build Armenia, fill its technology education centers, and improve the country from within. Knowing how to pick a fight and when to admit defeat is a virtue, not a weakness. Living to fight another day is a blessing, and one that we should not take for granted. ",1

I know how toxic from Russian side at almost all the time were relations between Russia(USSR) and Armenia. Especially recently. Now russian propaganda states that Armenia is the enemy, traitors or something like that. 
Also i know how hard it could be to be Armenian in Russia sometimes. Despite that i never experienced something like that here. I talked many times with people about it, they disliked Russian politics but never the people. It really touched me from the start.
Now i'm afraid that people here could start think the opposite way that Russians are enemies.

While not Armenian, I empathize with your struggles for freedom from genocidal aggression.

Well, this is what I think.

-Russia is a huge threat to Europe. It directly borders EU, and field the largest army in the entire continent.

- It currently invades Ukraine and commit warcrimes there. It also threatens to invade other countries, which many are in the EU. 

-They talk about reconquering the USSR borders.

-They are allied with China, which is a totalitarian dystopia and threatens many countries.

-They have nukes.

Meanwhile, Azerbaijan:

-Merely threatens Armenia, a small nation in Caucassus which has no significance to Europe in terms of military, diplomacy and economy. And let's not forget that Armenia is in a military alliance with Russia.

-Azerbaijan enjoys good relations with all of its neighbors except Iran and Armenia.

-Carries gas to Europe, which reduces the Russian hegemony on Europe's gas, which is always welcome.

-Supports Ukraine in many ways.

-Their claims are accepted by people, which means:

a)They are simply right in pursuing their cause, so no one wants to side with Armenia

b)They excel at propaganda when compared to Armenia, which is huge given that there are many armenians living in important countries and actually affect their politics.

Armenians, do you know the geographic difference between former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and Arsakh (have to misspell it because the word is not allowed here) as two entities? Please just honest answers.

Do you understand where the majority of the Azerbaijani refugees came from?

Do you understand that by adding the surrounding 7 regions that were never part of Nagorno Karabakh into Arsakh you whitewashed ethnic cleansing of 700.000-800.000 internally displaced people?

I think Armenians still don’t get it and neither do stupid Western journalists. It’s frustrating as hell reading these articles and seeing that they just pick one but list statistics of the other. For example, someone on Twitter today “Arsakh never had more than 40.000 Azerbaijani population, your fabrication of refugees is government propaganda.”

Air sirens were activated in Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday after Azerbaijan launched a massive air and land assault on the republic after months of preparing the ground with false accusations of ""provocations by Armenians"". It's a tactic commonly used by Azerbaijan ahead of every aggression to mislead the international community.

The targets were civilian structures in settlements and Nagorno-Karabakh's local Defense Army's positions along the line of contact. Drones, artillery, and missile systems were/are being used. The Republic of Armenia withdrew its army from Nagorno-Karabakh shortly after the 2020 war. With this attack, Azerbaijan is attempting to subjugate the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh by disarming their local defense forces. 

##... casualties as of late evening

27 dead (1 child, 2 civilians)

200 wounded (>12 children, dozens of civilians)

Azerbaijan said it has captured 60 positions along the line of contact.

##... before the aggression

Azerbaijan claimed they had informed Russia ahead of the attack. Russia said they were informed only minutes before the launch. They requested Azerbaijan to ensure the safety of Russian peacekeepers. They are in talks with Azerbaijan about the situation.

Russia said its peacekeepers will not take action against Azerbaijan's aggression unless Azerbaijan targets them first.

##... the goal is to force ethnic Armenians to leave their homeland 

**MFA of ARMENIA:** Guided by a sense of impunity, Azerbaijan openly took responsibility for the aggression. We strongly condemn Azerbaijan's aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh and the mass atrocity crimes which is the continuation of the 2020 war. 

We have repeatedly warned that the continuous aggressive actions of Azerbaijan, the warmongering rhetoric, and the reprehensible propaganda of calling the population of Nagorno-Karabakh ""terrorists"" pursues one goal: to subject the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to ethnic cleansing through the use of force and deprive them from the right to live freely and in dignity in their own homeland.

We call on international partners, members of the UN Security Council, and the Russian peacekeeping contingent to undertake clear and unequivocal steps to put an end to Azerbaijan's aggression. //

**PM PASHINYAN:** Azerbaijan's aggression began with an artillery attack, followed by a ground invasion of border positions and some villages. The goal is to subject the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to ethnic cleansing. Russian peacekeepers must take action. Secondly, the UN Security Council must take action. 

If Azerbaijan claims this is an ""anti-terrorist"" operation not targeting civilians, then why did they announce the opening of a humanitarian corridor for the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to leave the region? If their intention was not to target civilian settlements, they should have urged civilians to take shelter instead of leaving the region. *[Azerbaijan said they will allow ethnic Armenians to exit the republic via Lachin corridor.]*

Armenia never gave Azerbaijan a mandate to commit ethnic cleansings in Nagorno-Karabakh. The rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh must be guaranteed.

Any attempts to involve the Republic of Armenia in a conflict is unacceptable. There are internal and external forces who want to drag Armenia into a large-scale conflict to endanger Armenia's sovereignty. Armenia will not take any drastic steps at this time. Stay vigilant and wait for official updates. //

##... the future presence of Russia in the region will depend on their peacekeepers' response to Azerbaijani aggression: analyst Sergey Melkonyan

**MELKONYAN:** The choice is simple: either Russian peacekeepers guarantee the fulfillment of the Nov. 9 agreement and subdue the aggressor, or the war in the zone of responsibility of peacekeepers will take place under their passive observation. In that case, it will no longer be necessary to talk about Russia's role as an exclusive security provider.

##... Russia's response

Russia requested ""both sides"" to establish a ceasefire. A ranking member of Armenia's ruling party expressed disappointment over Russia's bothsidesism rhetoric.

Lately, Russia has been accusing the Armenian side [unclear if referring to Yerevan or Stepanakert] of not fulfilling certain ""obligations"". The Armenian government wants Russia to clarify what this ""obligation"" is. Armenia says it has met all the Nov. 9 obligations. 

**Analysis:** Azerbaijan wants a 'corridor' through Armenia that will be outside of Armenian control. Armenia says it's prepared to provide a transportation route to Azerbaijani traffic, monitored by Armenian and Russian customs agents jointly to ensure the safety of Azerbaijani travelers. Azerbaijan has rejected the offer; they want only Russian or Azerbaijani agents to monitor it.

Russia has not publicly clarified what exactly it wants from Armenia, and whether it expects a ""corridor"" passing through Armenia. Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan's media outlet had earlier accused Russia of covertly working with Azerbaijan to establish a Russian-controlled sovereign corridor passing through Armenia. This would be against the Nov. 9 agreement.

Azerbaijan and Russia have kept the population of Nagorno-Karabakh under blockade since December 2022 after the Armenian government's refusal to grant the ""corridor"" to Azerbaijan. //

##... Armenian PM Pashinyan's media outlet claims Russia gave Nagorno-Karabakh's Defense Army's equipment locations to Azerbaijan

**ArmTimes:** According to sources, the Russian side provided Azerbaijan with the coordinates of equipment and structures in Nagorno-Karabakh before moving away from the mentioned positions to allow Azerbaijan to launch the attack.

##... Russia's ex-president Dmitri Medvedev: Can you guess what's awaiting Pashinyan?

Dmitri Medvedev said that Pashinyan will be removed from power for strengthening Armenia's relations with the West.

**KAREN SARGSYAN, analyst:** I normally wouldn't take Medvedev seriously because he is known for making provocative statements, including about nuclear strikes and the Ukraine war. But it's entirely possible that he has been briefed on certain activities that are being planned in Armenia. 

We knew that Kremlin didn't want Pashinyan in power but this is the first time a high-ranking official is openly stating it. I'm not surprised. By formally remaining part of the Russian-led block, we are depriving ourselves of the ability to establish closer cooperation with the West. 
The darkest time is always just before sunrise. We are closer than ever to Kosovo's scenario. Nagorno-Karabakh must fight for dignified self-governance or statehood. //

The pro-Russian opposition forces gathered in front of the government building with demands for Pashinyan's removal. They clashed with the police in an attempt to break into the building. Over 30 police officers and protesters were injured. 

Other protesters gathered in front of the Russian embassy to complain about Russia's inaction and for allowing Azerbaijan to carry out ethnic cleansing. They encircled the embassy. Analyst Karen Sargsyan said the goal was to entrap and starve out the Russian ambassador. Russia's MFA sent a note to Armenia requesting the blockade to be lifted.

##... Russian state propagandist Margarita Simonyan: Russia will do fine without Armenia 

**SIMONYAN:** Russia will survive without Armenia, but Armenia without Russia - of course not. Kim Kardashian and NATO won't help you. Only Russia can help Armenia. //

##... interview with Armenia's National Security Council chief Armen Grigoryan || Russia is not a reliable partner

**GRIGORYAN:** As we have repeatedly warned, Azerbaijan is attempting to carry out an ethnic cleansing and genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**REPORTER:** Is the target only Nagorno-Karabakh?

**GRIGORYAN:** Events in Nagorno-Karabakh have a direct impact on the internal stability of Armenia. Just as on November 9, 2020, we see certain forces with the direct support of external forces [Russian] are targeting the government. 

**REPORTER:** Why hasn't the government prosecuted those who have committed violence and called for a coup in Armenia over the past 3 years? Isn't your lax policy at fault? Why is the state allowing this? 

**GRIGORYAN:** There are objective and subjective reasons for them not being behind bars. These are individuals who are being used by foreign states. I think everyone in Armenia understands this now. The public has already judged them by ignoring their calls.  

**REPORTER:** They blame you for the current situation, for harming the relations with Russia. 

**GRIGORYAN:** If they think Russia bases its strategic goals on individual level then we cannot take Russia seriously. As for the ongoing propaganda campaign to blame Armenia for the situation, it should be noted that Azerbaijan is the genocidal aggressor here.

**REPORTER:** The opposition blames you for the cooperation between Russia and Azerbaijan.

**GRIGORYAN:** Russia has been cooperating with Azerbaijan for a long time now. They started selling weapons worth $5 billion to Azerbaijan a decade ago. Armenia did not make any changes to its foreign policy vector after we came to power in 2018, at least not until 2022.

Russia has very clear obligations under the Nov. 9, 2020, Statement to protect Nagorno-Karabakh. What is their issue with the Armenian government in this context? Do they mean there is something more important than Vladimir Putin's signature under that document? Is it worth nothing? 

Russia has not been fulfilling its obligation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan has launched a large-scale attack under the inaction of Russian peacekeepers.  

Russia claims it learned about the attack just minutes before the launch. In reality, we've been informing them and the world at least since September 4th about Azerbaijan's pending aggression. Pashinyan sent a letter to Putin, describing the entire situation. 

**REPORTER:** The pro-Russian opposition claims since you're conducting NATO exercises in Armenia, sending the First Lady to Kyiv, ratifying the Rome Statute, all of these are interpreted as hostile steps by Russia so they are choosing not to help.

**GRIGORYAN:** None of the steps taken by Armenia that you've just listed existed before December 2021, yet Russia displayed inaction after Azerbaijan's invasion of Sotk/Khoznavar direction in May and November. Facts show that Russia is not fulfilling its obligations. Even the Prague meeting hadn't taken place yet. 

Instead, Russia adopted Azerbaijan's arguments claiming that the reason is the lack of delimited AM-AZ borders. In reality, we do have fixed borders under the Alma-Ata agreement. Russia could have protected those borders if it wanted to. They'd rather blame Armenia endlessly. Something is wrong with our skin and eye color, we may find out one day. 

**REPORTER:** They say you came with anti-Russian policies in 2018.

**GRIGORYAN:** We entered Syria under the Russian flag. We voted in support of Russia in every institution. We remained in CSTO and EAEU. Our vector didn't change. But in the end, all we got was a Nagorno-Karabakh war in 2020 and the invasion of Armenia in 2021-2022. None of this has to do with the Prague meeting. Real allies help instead of finding excuses.

**REPORTER:** Should Armenia intervene in the ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh? 

**GRIGORYAN:** The army of the Republic of Armenia continues to defend only the Republic of Armenia. As for the Nagorno-Karabakh situation, the international community, and first and foremost Russia, must take steps. Russian peacekeepers have many obligations other than providing medical aid. Their primary role is to protect the safety of the civilians. Vladimir Putin's signature is on it. 

**REPORTER:** Dmitri Medvedev threatened to destroy the Armenian government. How do you plan on cooperating with Russia after that statement? 

**GRIGORYAN:** It's something that Russia should think about. They should clarify that policy because it is against the Republic of Armenia in general. There is a war and they are making such statements? I think the Armenian public will show an adequate response to that.

If Russia wants to remain in this region, they must take steps to prevent the ethnic cleansing and genocide. If they don't, that means they have chosen to leave the region. // *[sounds like an ultimatum]*

##... calls are made to nationalize Russian companies' assets in Armenia 

**Ioannesian, Informed Citizens NGO:** Armenia gave Russia a monopoly for gas, all the important economic hubs, the nuclear plant, railways, membership to CSTO and EAEU, all this in exchange for security guarantees. 

It's obvious now that Russia has joined our enemy. Now they are trying to organize a coup in Armenia.

Immediately nationalize Gazprom-Armenia, take over the control of railways and the nuclear plant, remove the 102nd Russian military base from Armenia and their border guards, and shut down the broadcasting of Russian state media in Armenia. //

##... major Russian opposition media outlets and figures took a more pro-Armenian stance 

Putin critic Vladimir Milov, a former Russian government member, believes ethnic Armenians cannot be ruled by Azerbaijan because the latter is a dictatorship that cannot guarantee the physical safety of Armenians, especially considering the history of massacres of Armenians in various settlements of Azerbaijan. He joined the EU and condemned the aggression. Milov said he had warned Armenia not to trust Putin with Armenia's security. *""Putin spat on Armenia.""*

##... interview with ex-PM Aram Sargsyan

**SARGSYAN:** The world has seen conflicts like this. There was a similar situation in Kosovo. Azerbaijan has adopted Serbia's policies. The UN decided to deploy peacekeepers after Serbs invaded territories and took hostages. The Hague ruled it a genocide, prompting the world to recognize Kosovo's independence. 

The difference with Nagorno-Karabakh is that while the leaders of Kosovo had been working with the West for a year, the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh chose to cling to Russia and dismissed the ""British tanks that cannot climb our mountains"". I've warned on numerous occasions that the only way to save Nagorno-Karabakh is by deploying international peacekeepers. 

My brothers, you followed Russia and removed President Arayik Harutyunyan from power in Nagorno-Karabakh, replacing him with some security agency agent. And what is the result? Do you want the same in Armenia now?

**REPORTER:** Explain the connection with Arayik's removal.

**SARGSYAN:** During his press conference Arayik urged the world and Russia to open the Lachin corridor within 15 days. I've been in touch with Arayik and I'll open a secret now *[here we go again]*: I listened to his stance and informed him that I'll convey his message to the U.S. ambassador in Armenia. Arayik's stance was that if within 15 days the world didn't do everything possible to open the Lachin corridor, a mass starvation would begin, prompting the Nagorno-Karabakh government to request a safe corridor to evacuate the entire 120,000 population out of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

If Arayik was in power right now, he would have made that request, [prompting a strong response from the West and more pressure]. Today's president will not do this because that would be against Russian interests. Russia needs 5,000 ethnic Armenians with Azerbaijani passports to remain in Nagorno-Karabakh so they can keep their troops in this region.

**REPORTER:** Why shouldn't Armenia become part of Russia, like Tatarstan? We are surrounded by enemies. Maybe that's the best option. 

**SARGSYAN:** Independence is a supreme value. I would have arrested you for even suggesting that if I were the authority. 

**REPORTER:** I'm just asking. 

**SARGSYAN:** Hah. Still unacceptable. That would be the end of Armenia. The path to our survival is to break free of Russia. Declare right now that Armenia is choosing the U.S. nuclear technology for its next reactor. The U.S. first made an offer to install modular reactors in Armenia 3 years ago. You could diversify the reactors' geographical locations for security and power grid management purposes. They are also very seismically resilient due to their capsular design.  

The UN Security Council session is on Thursday. The government of Nagorno-Karabakh must send them a letter stating that Russian peacekeepers aren't fulfilling their duties, and make the following demand: either send international peacekeepers or ensure a safe exodus of ethnic Armenians out of Nagorno-Karabakh. //

##... EU's response to Azerbaijan's aggression

The EU requested Azerbaijan to cease the attack and added: *""This military escalation should not be used as a pretext to force the exodus of the local population.""*

**EU:** We condemn the military escalation along the Line of Contact & in other locations in Karabakh.  We call for an immediate cessation of hostilities & for Azerbaijan to stop military activities. //

##... Norway's response:

>Continued use of Azerbaijani military power may force the Armenian population to flee the region and create a humanitarian catastrophe. Such a tragedy must be avoided at all costs.

##... France's response

France condemned Azerbaijan and requested a UN Security Council session on September 21. ""France places the exclusive responsibility for the fate of the people of Nagorno Karabakh on Azerbaijan.""

France is in touch with the U.S. and EU. A phone call was held between Pashinyan and Macron.

##... U.S. response

Pashinyan spoke with Anthony Blinken. They both emphasized the need to use international mechanisms for de-escalation.

**BLINKEN:** The U.S. calls on Azerbaijan to cease these military actions immediately. These actions are worsening an already dire humanitarian situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and undermine prospects for peace.  As we have previously made clear to Azerbaijan, the use of force to resolve disputes is unacceptable and runs counter to efforts to create conditions for a just and dignified peace in the region.  We call for an immediate end to hostilities and for respectful dialogue between Baku and representatives of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh.


##... UK's response 

**UK:** The return of military conflict is devastating for the local population. Azerbaijan should cease military action. U.K. working hard to urge dialogue. 

##... Germany accuses Azerbaijan of breaking a promise 

**FM of Germany, Baerbock:** Over the past few weeks, we've spoken with the Azerbaijani side and received promises for the safe passage of humanitarian convoys, and that there won't be violence. We see that this promise was broken.

**PM Scholz:** Baku must immediately stop the attacks and return to diplomacy to reach a peaceful solution.

##... response by Freedom House:

Any attempt to forcibly change the region's demographics is illegal and unacceptable. We strongly condemn the Azerbaijani government’s violent attacks in Nagorno-Karabakh, heightening the risk of ethnic cleansing against the region’s Armenian population.


##... POLITICO: Azerbaijan launches attack in Nagorno-Karabakh, announces ‘evacuation’ of Armenian population

[article](https://www.politico.eu/article/azerbaijan-launch-anti-terror-operation-nagorno-karabakh-armenia/)

##... ethnic Armenian civilians in a Nagorno-Karabakh village find themselves encircled by Azerbaijani troops 

Village Yeghtsahogh (Եղցահող) with a population of 150 cannot evacuate residents because they have been encircled. Azerbaijani army targeted the local school.

The village is just north of Mets Shen, another village that was targeted by Azerbaijan shortly after the 2020 war. 

##... Azerbaijani aggression has forced ethnic Armenians of 16 Nagorno-Karabakh villages to leave their homes 

Some of the villages are Khramort, Khnapat, Sarnaghbyur, Nakhijevanik, Machkalashen, and Chankatagh. They are located along the Agdam-Stepanakert road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh's Ivanyan to Azerbaijan's Agdam.

Overall, 7,000 people had to be evacuated out of 16 settlements across Nagorno-Karabakh.

##... calls for negotiations

The Nagorno-Karabakh government urged Azerbaijan to cease hostilities as soon as possible and engage in negotiations. Azerbaijan later stated they are willing to hold talks in the Azerbaijani settlement of Yevlakh under the condition that Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians would dissolve all branches of the local government. No ceasefire has been established as of 2 a.m.

##... members of the European Parliament urged the European Council to discuss sanctions against Azerbaijan

**MEPs:** We condemn in the strongest terms this pre-planned and unjustified Azerbaijani attack on Nagorno-Karabakh. In the absence of an immediate halt to the attack, we call on the EU Council to fundamentally review relations with Azerbaijan and consider imposing sanctions against the responsible Azerbaijani authorities.

##electoral commission is conducting mandatory recount after a tight race in Yerevan municipal elections 

The process will be monitored by the political parties, NGOs, and the press. It will be recorded. A difference of as little as 100 votes could change the number of Council seats allocated to each party, said Informed Citizens NGO yesterday.

The former regime has, without evidence, accused the ruling party of attempting to ""rig"" the vote. The ruling party denied the accusation and said they did not initiate this recount. This recount is required under the law. Three random polling stations will be selected in each precinct for the recount.

##analyst Karen Sargsyan about Yerevan elections

**KAREN:** Tigran Avinyan was perhaps the worst candidate the ruling party could have nominated. He was a pandemic- and war-era figure with heavy baggage. Even many officials within QP did not want his candidacy. The ruling party's mistake was treating Yerevan like the rest of the country. 

Still, I don't think this election indicates the end of Pashinyan. If the turnout was >50% with each party winning similar shares, then perhaps you could argue that.

What's clear after this election is that the former regime has peaked. They only got like 25,000 votes out of 825,000. That's about the size of their biggest crowd during the 2021-2022 protests. 

The state of media health is laughable. People are hooked on Russian-language Telegram channels. The public is consuming Russian propaganda en masse yet even under these conditions they could only get 25,000 votes. //

##Hayk Marutyan's team supports the idea of working with the former regime to remove Pashinyan from power

Context in [yesterday's election results coverage](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16m6bex/the_clown_show_begins/).

Marutyan's ranking party member Isabella Abgaryan was asked to comment on a possible coalition with the former regime and Dog, after Marutyan left the door open in his Monday speech. 

Marutyan's team does not want to sign an official coalition but wants the former regime and Dog to help Marutyan become the mayor. ""We all have the same goal,"" said Abgaryan. The goal is to prevent ""evil"" Tigran Avinyan from becoming the mayor. 

**QUESTION:** How would this setup work, though? If the ex-regime and Dog vote for Marutyan without a formal coalition and join the QP as opposition.

**ABGARYAN:** It will be an interesting situation. The second largest party will rule. The largest party will become an opposition. No worries though, because the Council only makes decisions on non-political issues. They are about administrative decisions. Obviously, Marutyan and our team will have to ensure that other parties support his proposed plans. 

We must never forget that we only have an advantage of a single seat, however. That's dangerous. I've never seen a Council session where every member is present for a vote. People miss a vote because they get sick, they are on a trip etc. Avinyan would have a similar problem if he were in our place. How are you supposed to pass the municipal budget like this? Sadly, I predict a governing crisis. This was not the ideal outcome.

**QUESTION:** In exchange for votes, the former regime wants Marutyan to help remove Pashinyan from power. Do you support this?

**ABGARYAN:** If Marutyan becomes the mayor of Yerevan, obviously he will be interested in changing the central government in Armenia and remove Pashinyan who is unfriendly to him.

##Azerbaijan is an unreliable partner, Europe should stop buying its natural gas: head of European Parliament Roberta Metsola

[article,](https://arka.am/en/news/politics/head_of_european_parliament_calls_baku_an_unreliable_partner_saying_europe_should_stop_buying_its_na/)



##Azerbaijan's plan to double gas exports to EU at risk as talks stall: Bloomberg 

>Azerbaijan may not be able to deliver on ambitions to double natural gas exports to Europe by 2027, having failed to secure long-term sales deals it needs before investing billions of dollars to boost production, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

AZ-EU talks began after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the EU's energy crisis has since eased and they aren't as desperate anymore. 

>time may have run out for Azerbaijan to lock in the long-term contracts it needs to underpin investments in infrastructure.

Unlike pipeline transfers, liquified natural gas (LNG) does not require decades-long contracts and its infrastructure is flexible. The EU will buy LNG from the U.S. and Qatar.

>the market is expected to see a buildup of an oversupply in global LNG markets from 2027 and onwards

Romania said it will not sign a long-term contract. Germany has not yet held any serious talks with Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijani gas industry official says they might not be able to meet the target of supplying the additional 10 bcm to Europa by 2027. 

>Azerbaijan’s recent seizure of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which led about 100,000 Armenians to flee to Armenia amid fears of ethnic cleansing, could weigh on any decisions European buyers make. 

An American analyst believes Azerbaijan ""has shot itself in the foot"" with the invasion, and that Azeri gas will remain in Azerbaijan unless Turkey wants to buy more.

##interview with Nagorno-Karabakh opposition leader Samvel Babayan 

Read Babayan's [September 26](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16t0inm/samvel_babayan_azerbaijan_had_agreed_to_autonomy/) interview for context. He revealed details from the not-so-secret negotiations he was holding with Azerbaijan with the permission of President Arayik, against the wishes of the former regime that would later oust Arayik. Babayan was the first high-profile Nagorno-Karabakh official who crossed into Armenia without getting arrested. He said the Azerbaijan agents weren't thoroughly checking the passports during the mass exodus. The opposition parties in Armenia accused Babayan of complicating the departure of other Nagorno-Karabakh officials, citing more thorough identification procedures at the checkpoint a day after Babayan's crossing.

**REPORTER:** [Brings up Babayan's safe passage through the checkpoint]

**BABAYAN:** You can end the conspiracy theories by requesting Azerbaijan to share the video footage from the checkpoint to see how exactly I crossed it. I drove there, greeted the Azeri agents, got scanned, and entered Armenia. My impression is that the agents did not recognize me and weren't expecting me to be there. Over 20 generals crossed the same way as I did.

**REPORTER:** There are no Armenians left in Nagorno-Karabakh, yet we don't see Azeris [civilians] in Nagorno-Karabakh, either. They have invaded everything, so what are they waiting for? 

**BABAYAN:** Azerbaijan will refrain from making any moves for 2 months to ""allow the Nagorno-Karabakh population to return"", according to them. The question is, if Armenians return, will they be forced to ""reintegrate"", or will we receive some kind of autonomous status? The latter was my proposal. There were negotiations. The documents have been handed over to authorities as part of a general investigation. You will eventually see them.

But we should focus on the situation today. We must continue these negotiations with Azerbaijan to allow Armenians to have an autonomous republic within the NKAO borders. Without this, it would be pointless to try to return. People will regret it if they return without a status. 

It is true that Azerbaijan has assigned a commandant to oversee the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Their goal is to convince a few thousand Armenians to return so they'll avoid being accused of ethnic cleansing. Today there are no more than 33 Armenians left. 

There are also efforts in Armenia to return some refugees to Nagorno-Karabakh. I don't know who these people are, whether they are Russian agents or someone else, but they are attempting to convince some of the refugees to return by promising that Russian peacekeepers will remain in the region for many years and ""it will be safe"".

**REPORTER:** One must be a kamikaze to agree to return under these conditions.

**BABAYAN:** You can always find people who are easily convinced, who are perhaps elderly and get tired easily and want to return to old life. I advise them to be careful.

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan could have easily repopulated the invaded areas by bussing in thousands of people. Why haven't they done so yet?  

**BABAYAN:** There is international pressure to create conditions to allow Armenians to return. Aliyev's adviser has revealed that Azerbaijan will refrain from any actions in Nagorno-Karabakh over the next 2 months because they want Armenians to return. Azerbaijan will try to use these 2 months to strengthen its diplomatic positions.

**REPORTER:** What is your vision for returning the refugees to their homes?

**BABAYAN:** The same thing that I was negotiating with Azerbaijan. We were in the midst of negotiations [when the invasion took place]. The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army has been dissolved so that issue is no longer on the table. We should continue to negotiate around the other issues. 

**REPORTER:** Will the Nagorno-Karabakh population trust you?

**BABAYAN:** The real question is, will the negotiation lead to the return of the population? People want someone to successfully negotiate for their safe return. We are holding talks with various circles from Nagorno-Karabakh regarding our negotiations with Azerbaijan so that no one will claim it's an obscure process, but I will not ask for anyone's ""permission"" to hold these negotiations. I can do so as the #2 political party of Nagorno-Karabakh.

**REPORTER:** It's not clear anymore who the leader of Nagorno-Karabakh is after Shahramanyan's decree to dissolve the state.

**BABAYAN:** He did not have the legal right to sign that document. He can't annul a referendum by a stroke of a pen.

**REPORTER:** How were President Shahramanyan and the 22 MPs who voted for him able to safely leave Nagorno-Karabakh, after the arrest of others? Did he sign the decree in exchange for saving his own skin? 

**BABAYAN:** The decree was the ransom payment. I'm cooperating with investigators in Armenia by sharing my knowledge. The other leaders should be invited to testify. Shahramanyan signed a ceasefire agreement that claimed the army of the Republic of Armenia was in Nagorno-Karabakh, which isn't true. Armenian authorities must investigate this.

The regime in Nagorno-Karabakh has long over-relied on ""phone calls from Moscow"" to solve the problems. This is why we've lost our country. I've been warning my fellow Karabakhis since 2016 that they will become refugees soon because of the actions of the thieves in charge. 

**REPORTER:** There are reports that the 3 ex-presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh were arrested by Azerbaijan in the military base belonging to Russian peacekeepers in Ivanyan. They hoped until the end to reach Armenia safely. Why did they end up getting arrested?

**BABAYAN:** According to the information I have, they weren't arrested at the Russian military base in Ivanyan. One of them was arrested in Stepanakert's wine factory [ehh?], and the others on the road. Yes, they had received promises [by Russian peacekeepers] about being safely evacuated. But they should have known better that it wouldn't work. The wife of Volkov [the head of Russian peacekeepers] was searched by Azeris every time the Russian helicopter would land in Nagorno-Karabakh. The ex-leaders should have realized that [Russians couldn't help them reach Armenia]. Why would Russia take a risk if you are disposable for them, you are one of their many agents.

**REPORTER:** Armenia sent tens of millions of dollars to support Nagorno-Karabakh residents under the blockade. The private sector was destroyed but the public workers continued to receive salaries with the help of Armenia's subsidies. People had money but didn't have a place where they could spend it. A lot of money was sent to Nagorno-Karabakh over the past few years. Where did it all go?

**BABAYAN:** Nagorno-Karabakh (pop. 120,000) had a public sector with a whopping 25,000 employees. Plus the army and territorial defense forces. I have long accused Pashinyan of enabling the regime in Stepanakert by showering them with cash. He gave drugs to an addict. The greedy regime in Stepanakert ended up causing the situation we are in today. You and I should not speculate where the money went to. Let the authorities investigate. But yes, the schemes worked until the last day.

I've been in touch with mayors of villages and towns. I have advised Pashinyan on how to handle the refugee influx, how to help people integrate, to prevent them from becoming diasporans. We made that mistake with the Armenians who escaped Sumgayit and Baku. Can't do that again.

##interview with analyst Karen Sargsyan || Banning Russian TV channels || Russia-Armenia relations || Geopolitics

**REPORTER:** [Ruling party members] recently mentioned the possibility of prohibiting the broadcasting of Russian state media in Armenia [for spreading propaganda against Armenia's sovereignty]. As it turns out, Armenian households have access to more Russian television channels than Armenian, in our own broadcasting multiplex. Moreover, Russian channels are the only foreign ones. We have fewer Armenian channels, zero English-language channels, and a large number of Russian channels. What is the effect on Armenia and our society?

**KAREN:** That's because we have a cowardly government that allows this to continue. Moreover, the H1 public network never invites Ukrainian officials for an interview, but there is no shortage of Russian officials. The network is run by a pro-Russian sect. 

One of the members of the sect is the director of No. 36 school, who recently summoned the teachers and told them ""We must collectively go lick Russian boots because we wouldn't exist without them."" That's a copy of Margarita Simonyan's social media posts. This is a clinical case that warrants a medical examination.

Authorities say they can't shut down Russian channels because they can't touch the commercial sector. That's just an excuse, there are easy ways to restrict the channels: Require Armenian ISPs to pay ֏700M per week per subscriber for broadcasting a Russian channel.

But that wouldn't be enough. They must summon the heads of every government office and give them 3 hours to block internet access to IP addresses belonging to Russian tech giants like mail ru, Yandex, Rambler, and Vkontakte. Block them all. There are criminal idiots in the government who email top-secret documents to each other through mail ru.

They met Zelenskty 1.5 years late, they ratified the Rome Statute 9 months late, so are they going to delay the banning of Russian channels by another year now? Why?

No more than 20% of our population uses the free-to-air public multiplex to watch Russian channels. Everyone else has internet [cable]. That 20%, most of whom are low-income residents in rural areas, don't watch Russian-language channels that much. So the main problem that spreads Russian propaganda isn't the free-to-air, it's the cable. When you buy a package with 100+ channels it comes with Russian channels by default. You have 14 channels that broadcast Russian soap operas, lots of Russian cartoon networks with Russian ads, etc.. This is the domain that pushes the Kremlin propaganda. Thankfully, the authorities have found the courage to at least bring this issue to the surface. 

**REPORTER:** Why are the Russian channels dangerous?

**KAREN:** When the first wave of Russian relocants moved to Armenia after the launch of the Ukraine war, some of them subscribed to cable channels and told me that there is more Kremlin propaganda in Armenia than in Russia. They were shocked. This is also a bad look in front of Europe. To describe the current state of our media, it's like a father feeding bread to his kid while both of them sit in a pile of shit in a barn.

**REPORTER:** Russian channels have become anti-Armenian.

**KAREN:** Their Telegram, too. Ideally, we'd have more Armenian-language content so they would push the Russian channels out, but in the short term, banning is the only option.

Why do we even have a school named after [Russian poet] Pushkin? Shut it down and transfer Pushkin's statue straight to a landfill. What has Pushkin done for Armenia? The same about Chekhov. 
We have an Armenian-Russian Slavonic University. Remove ""Russian"". Make it a general university associated with Slavic countries. Invite Poles and Slovaks to co-manage it.

I graduated from a school that was later named after [Soviet physisit] Sakharov after his death. It was very well funded by the Soviet regime back in my days. It was considered as one of the best in Armenia. The Soviet regime always made sure to properly fund Russian schools in Armenia. This was a known thing. They even built an underground passage near the Chekhov school. How many Armenian schools can you name on Baghramyan Avenue [prestigious area]? Russian schools were considered elite. Bolsheviks were taking their kids to Russian schools.   

**REPORTER:** About the quality of teachers and schools today...

**KAREN:** Awful. Sadly, we must rebuild our educational system from the ground up. Three mandatory languages: Armenian, English, and French. It must be based on a Western model: Swiss, Finnish, or British. 

I'm sure someone will lecture me on how great the Soviet schools were for math and physics. The reality is that the students and their parents of these elite phys-math schools could not have been smart because they believed in nonsense. The population of the USSR was hooked on Anatoly Kashpirovsky's psychic bullshit. People would place a bucket of water in front of their TV and tune in to Kashpirovsky's psychic session so the water would receive ""energy"". A person who is supposedly good at physics would never do or believe anything like this. The so-called ""good at physics"" was on surface-level only, or did not exist at all. You are not good at physics if you place a bottle of water in front of the TV and expect some monkey from Moscow's Ostankino Tower to remotely send energy to it. You are just an ordinary moron. Have you ever seen a homeless person on the streets who graduated from Harvard? You haven't, because in a normal society, you never fall below a certain level if you graduate from, let's say, a college or a university. There is a minimum threshold. But in ex-USSR republics, you can find many hobos with good diplomas. 

**REPORTER:** About the AM-AZ border delimitation and trade routes.

**KAREN:** Azerbaijan and Russia don't want Turkey to lift the blockade on Armenia. We shouldn't give Azerbaijan any routes to Nakhijevan until the AM-AZ border delimitation is over. Or, we could give them a route via Ijevan, whichever brings the most benefits to us. 

The Armenian government wants to use 1975 Soviet maps to demarcate the AM-AZ borders. The problem is that these maps were created with the use of highly inaccurate geolocation technologies. If you take that map and stand on a location mentioned on that map, your GPS could show that you're 400 meters off. These maps were created with the use of Baltika-42 or Kronshtadt-42 systems that are inaccurate on high altitudes. It was calibrated for use at a Baltic Sea level, or the Gulf of Finland. It's highly inaccurate. 

There is no shortage of degenerates in our military who want to use that. Even Russia has given up on that tech and they don't trust their own maps drawn with that technology. Arshak Karapetyan, the idiot who served as the defense minister for 6 months before being fired by Pashinyan, who is now releasing pro-Russian videos from Moscow, is the one who convinced Pashinyan to use the inaccurate 1975 maps. Have they actually *seen* the 1975 maps? Why not maps from earlier years?

**REPORTER:** Today, everyone and their uncle are discussing these maps, the 29,800 km^2, and the enclaves. Are the enclaves in or out? This is what the population is focused on today.

**KAREN:** People should focus on washing their hands before leaving the toilet instead of enclaves. People aren't paying attention to their children's grades and do not help them with homework because parents themselves have forgotten 4th-grade math. That's what they should do, not discuss enclaves. Can people even tell the difference between an enclave and an exclave? Why do they care? 

**REPORTER:** Why is everyone focused on enclaves?

**KAREN:** Because the degenerates called ""opposition parties"", and several degenerate government members, want to divert the attention from real issues that impact the population, such as the economy, currency exchange, education, etc. These are the things that have an actual impact on the ordinary Armenians, not the ""enclaves"". 

Armenia will not have peace for as long as Russia exists in its current form. The first thing an Armenian must do in the morning is to read two prayers: one for Zelensky and one for Ukraine to win the war *as soon as possible*. Pashinyan can speak about an era of peace and sign 10 peace agreements every day, but none of it will be worth anything as long as Aliyev has the backing of Putin.

##Armenian and German scientists have been busy collecting data from Lake Sevan over the past few years 

Armenian scientists make regular visits to Germany to study European methods. The AM-DE joint research group has collected data from Sevan over the past 3 years. They have concluded the project. The collected data has allowed them to create various models. 

Lake Sevan has lost a significant portion of its ""cold"" layer due to the gradual decrease in water levels throughout the decades. One of the models allows scientists to predict what would happen if the water levels were to rise again, and how long it would take to restore the cold protective layer.

The plankton population was one of the targets of the research. Planktons respond quickly to changes in the quality of water and ""food"" ecosystem. They are a great metric.

Hydro-ecology stations were installed in the lake to continuously monitor the water quality.

German scientists provided modern instruments for studying problems in various layers of the lake. The project was co-funded by the German government.

##Yerevan municipal elections: voting results by each district 

The map shows how each district voted on the election day. The ruling QP and opposition Republic parties are counted together due to friendly ties. The three other opposition parties are counted as one. Here is how the districts voted:

Ajapnyak: ruling

Davtashen: ruling

Arabkir: opposition

Zeytun: ruling

Avan: opposition

Nor-Nork: opposition

Nork-Marash: ruling

Kentron: opposition

Malatia: ruling

Shengavit: ruling

2/25/2022,Right now the behaviour of the west towards Turkey the last few years makes even less sense,"So, basically the west sanctioned Turkey over shit like invasions into Syria to protect Turkey from YPG/PKK terror that has plagued the country for dozens of years. They made Turkey's enemies the darlings of their people with their shitty propaganda media. They invaded Syria or propped up proxies and dragged Turkey along, only to leave later and left Turkey to defend Idlib to stop the flow of even more refugees. They made Turkey keep millions of Syrians in Turkey, and then painted Turkey as the bad guy anyway. They supported Greece with their expansionist EEZ policies and painted Turkey as the bad guy again on their shitty propaganda media. They sanctioned Turkey and heavily weakened Turkey's economy and military by refusing Patriots and F-35, also the 40 F-16s Turkey wanted instead. For what? Armenians and Kurds? That useless bunch? The Armenians that have historically always been on Russia's side? The Kurds who have also hurt western people in Europe and Turkey with their terrorism? The Greeks, who are currently opposing certain sanctions against their orthodox Russian brothers? Of the French who partnered up with Russia, along with Greece, in Libya?

And now with this Russian invasion, I hope it's finally clear for those dumbasses that you DON'T WEAKEN YOUR OWN NATO ALLY WHO IS LITERALLY PART OF YOUR EASTERN FLANK AND THE ONLY NATION THAT CAN AT LEAST PUT UP A FIGHT AGAINST RUSSIA IF NEEDED!

Seriously, they weakened Turkey so badly, that Turkey turned towards RUSSIA for anti air weaponry. Even for fighter jets, as Turkey seriously was and is considering Sukhoi's instead of western jets. Now, Turkey is losing its most important engine supplier for drones and jets. What is the west going to do now? Keep going with sanctions and weakening Turkey, or finally realising they need Turkey more than a bunch of cousin raping PKK terrorists and some Armo votes in California?

What Turkey should do currently, is nothing. If NATO doesn't do anything, neither should Turkey. Keep the Bosphorus open, why would we do anything if the rest is just going to do nothing? They either learn to keep their NATO ally close, or have a completely passive isolationist NATO ally who doesn't give a shit about them or anyone else, just like they have done to Turkey for years now.

Let the PKK/YPG/SDF and Armenia stop Russia now then. I'm sure their friendship and partnership with the west is so strong, they'll solve this and future problems with Russia. Or, the west can start supplying some fucking weapons to Turkey. Build up the Turkish Airforce. Give them Eurofighters, F-16s, F-15s, F-35A and B for the new carriers Turkey is building, drone engines, jet engines for the TAI TFX, Patriots, EW gear, etc. Build up the Turkish Air Force up to around 500/600 fixed wing fighters, more attack helicopters, some kick ass air defence, etc. And then maybe, one day, Turkey might be willing to bleed for NATO and non-NATO allies.

2/6/2017,The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict: The Unfortunate Role Of Propaganda,"As is sadly true of many wars, there are special interests supporting the instigators of this Nagorno-Karabakh war. Far from the frontlines and the gunfire, these interests effectuate advocacy campaigns of misconception and disinformation — working tirelessly to control global narratives and limit reactions to the truth. Lost in the noise are an illegal military occupation and ethnic cleansing implemented by Armenia against Azerbaijan.

One of the more troubling and unfortunately effective narratives is based on the religious identity of the two nations. The propagandists purposefully present it as a conflict ""between Christian Armenia and Muslim Azerbaijan."" Despite Azerbaijan's longstanding identity as a champion of multi-faith harmony, we don't live in a world where the specifics always matter. A lack of public knowledge and the triggering impact of fear and otherwise straightforward Islamophobia have allowed this message to effectively perpetuate brutal violence against Azerbaijan — a longstanding ally to the U.S. and the State of Israel; a safe and welcoming home to Christian and Jewish communities for centuries.

Azerbaijan is a secular republic, globally celebrated as a successful model for multi-faith and multicultural engagement. It is also an international champion, alongside the U.S. and other allies, in the fight against terrorism and extremism. Over 30,000 Armenian Christians live peacefully in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, which boasts a grand Armenian Church — completely renovated and perfectly preserved by the Azerbaijani Government. Nationwide, around 500,000 Christians of various denominations and 30,000 Jews live peacefully alongside a majority Muslim population.

Another commonly employed myth revolves around the ""true"" historical belonging of the Karabakh region. If facts matter at all, it's important to note that the last independent state in the region in question was the Azerbaijani-run Karabakh Khanate (1747-1805). When the Karabakh Khanate was taken over by the Russian Empire, Armenians constituted only around 8 percent of the region's population, and ethnic Azerbaijanis comprised over 90 percent. In the ensuing decades, the massive resettlement of Armenians to Karabakh from the Middle East increased their presence, as indigenous Azerbaijanis were expelled.

In January 1920, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR), the first secular democracy in the Muslim world, was de facto recognized by the Allied Powers, with the Nagorno-Karabakh region within its borders. In April 1920, the ADR was invaded by the Soviets. Thus Azerbaijan was incorporated into the Soviet Union with Nagorno-Karabakh as its integral part. In 1921, the so-called Caucasian Bureau passed a [decision](http://www.usazeris.org/integrity/kavburo.pdf) ""to keep Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan.""

Another very disturbing storyline that has been perpetuated by the lobbyists and military leaders eager to shift the blame, is that it was Nagorno-Karabakh ""self-defense forces"" that have fought against Azerbaijan and are ""in control"" of the occupied territory, not the armed forces of Armenia. In 2015, [the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=002-10619) that 

>the Republic of Armenia, through its military presence and the provision of military equipment and expertise, has been significantly involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict from an early date.

>This military support has been – and continues to be – decisive for the conquest of and continued control over the territories in issue.

ECHR cited [four 1993 U.N. Security Council resolutions](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424012611/http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm) condemning the occupation of Azerbaijan's territories and demanding the immediate withdrawal of Armenian forces from the occupied areas.

The Court [noted](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=002-10619): 

>It is hardly conceivable that Nagorno-Karabakh – an entity with a population of fewer than 150,000 ethnic Armenians – was able, without the substantial military support of Armenia, to set up a defense force in early 1992 that, against the country of Azerbaijan with approximately seven million people, not only established control of the former NKAO but also, before the end of 1993, conquered the whole or major parts of seven surrounding Azerbaijani districts.

The ECHR decision also conclusively refuted the myths regarding the so-called ""independence"" of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has never been recognized by any country and [is internationally regarded as part of Azerbaijan](http://www.un.org/press/en/2008/ga10693.doc.htm). 

The Court [stated](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=002-10619): 

>All of the above reveals that the Republic of Armenia, from the early days of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, has had a significant and decisive influence over the ""NKR"", that the two entities are highly integrated in virtually all important matters and that this situation persists to this day. In other words, the ""NKR"" and its administration survives by virtue of the military, political, financial and other support given to it by Armenia which, consequently, exercises effective control over Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories.

Without academic and historical context or significant knowledge of the region and the surrounding issues at play, it isn't surprising that some are confused about the turmoil in Karabakh, especially considering the powerful forces working to keep public perception far removed from the truth. However the risks of violent warfare are unambiguous, and it is critical to set the record straight. As the global community struggles with international terror, uncertain economic times and growing unrest in the Middle East, sorting out fact from fiction is essential as we look toward addressing the difficult issues posed by this conflict and numerous others around the globe.

I am using a throwaway account to protect myself as i don't want to be harassed by azeri/turkish nationalists, but if anyone is skeptical, i can prove my ""Turkishness"" to the mods of this sub. Before starting off, I want to clarify one thing. I was never a nationalist, and I've always recognized the Armenian Genocide, as I'm from a very left-wing family. However at the start of the conflict, I was almost drawn to the Azerbaijani/Turkish narrative, but some critical thinking prevented me from ever taking it seriously. So what i realized was 1- Majority of Artsakh is Armenian, and so, if it was ruled by Azerbaijan, the majority of the region couldn't rule themselves, and it would be an apartheid.

2- What Armenia did was the same as what we did in Northern Cyprus.

3- If Armenia should give Artsakh to Azerbaijan because at a certain point in time, majority of it was Azeri (according to azeri sources), that would mean that we should give our west coast to Greece as majority of the region was once Greek.

Furthermore, having friends from Armenia online, I got to hear their perspective, and i was made aware that Azerbaijan was committing atrocities too, despite never hearing about it on the news. I learned about Operation Ring and the Baku pogroms, and many other Azerbaijani atrocities that they tried to hide from me. I won't say that I support Armenia yet as I'm not informed well enough about the situation, but I definitely don't support Azerbaijan.

##Flashback 1918: How Armenian diplomats negotiated with the organizers of the 1915 genocide and almost cut a deal to expand Armenia 

It's June 1918. Armenia sent a delegation to Istanbul to try to amend the humiliating Treaty of Batum. This process was even more humiliating because they had to negotiate with the organizers of the Genocide: The Ottoman leaders Enver, Talât, and Cemal.

Ottomans had invited the 3 republics of Caucasus, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria to together discuss various issues including the conflicts between the Caucasus republics.

Armenia believed that Germany wanted to review the Batum Treaty according to the Brest-Litovsk provisions. Over the next 4 months, the Armenian delegation tried to gain the territories of Akhalkalak, Lori, Syunik, Karabakh, and Nakhijevan. It was a competition between the 3 republics. 

Ottomans were against giving Syunik and Karabakh to Armenia because they wanted to maintain direct access to Azerbaijan through the south. Similarly, they were against giving Akhalkalak and Lori to Armenia because they wanted a road towards Gandzak [today Ganja, Azerbaijan] through the north.

The diplomats from Azerbaijan and Georgia wanted lands that were part of Armenia. Each party wanted the most. This led to diplomatic clashes.

After waiting for 4 months, the big conference did not take place because Ottomans and Germans got their butts kicked on the battlefield. There were instead individual meetings with the Ottoman and other officials. 

Talât Pasha, one of the figures responsible for the genocide, lamented the ""misfortune that had befallen the Armenians"". He blamed the Kurds, local officials, and the military for the killings. The Armenian delegation swallowed the humiliation and thanked him for eventually agreeing to allow the formation of the Armenian Republic. 

Armenian delegation requested a meeting with Talât concerning the September 1918 massacres of Armenians in Baku. They asked Talât to order the Turkish army not to attack Karabakh. Talât called Enver and informed him that Armenians were requesting Karabakh not to be attacked. Talât then told the Armenian delegation that there would be no attack. The Armenian delegation met Enver and received the same reassurance. 

A month later, Enver invited the Armenian delegation to meet the Sultan. The delegation expressed hope that, from now on, independent Armenia and Turkey would be good neighbors. The Sultan was delighted that Armenians and Turks would finally have politically friendly relations. He sent greetings to the Armenian nation.

Enver invited the Armenian delegation to his house for dinner. The residence was covered in gold, silk, carpets, and all sorts of expensive junk. Also invited were delegations from Germany, Georgia, and Azerbaijan to discuss the Caucasian republics.

Armenia suggested splitting the Transcaucasus region as such: 38% to Armenia, 33% to Georgia, 29% to Azerbaijan. The other two republics rejected it.

The Armenian delegation spoke with Izzet Pasha, the Grand Vizier of the new cabinet, to discuss the withdrawal of the Ottoman army to the borders under the Brest-Litovsk. They accepted it. Moreover, they promised to help return all Armenian refugees and resolve their problems within 1 month. The Armenian delegation wanted to establish good relations with the Ottoman government to prevent negative intentions. 

Enver informed Armenians that Turkey would champion Armenia's rights to Lori-Pambak, and that he was confident that a satisfactory arrangement could be worked out with Azerbaijan. It was even possible that the boundaries of Armenia might be extended to the shores of the Akhurian River.

After Talât returned from Berlin, he made even more promises to Armenia, realizing how vulnerable the Ottomans were due to defeats on the battlefields. At the end of September, Talât announced that his government would grant Armenia concessions even greater than those sought by the Armenian delegation.

Those were Talât's last official words. The Ottoman Empire capitulated to the Allies a few days later. 

Rauf Bey, the Ottoman delegate tasked with signing a ceasefire with Britain, requested Armenia to send a delegate to the signing ceremony to show the British that the Ottomans and Armenians had reconciled. This is basically what happened next: 

**Armenia:** You've been a hardass all this time, Rauf Bey. Can you tell me what our borders will look like after your defeat?

**Rauf Bey:** The 1914 borders, amended at the cost of the Alashkert valley.

**Armenia:** We reject your offer and we will not send a delegate. The Allies have won and our hopes rely on their victory now.

##officials from Germany, U.S., and Russia spoke with colleagues from Armenia and Azerbaijan to reduce tensions on the AM-AZ border 

Azerbaijan denied accumulating forces on the AM-AZ border for a military provocation despite video evidence showing large accumulations on borders with Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. According to Azerbaijan, it's part of a planned training exercise to prepare for the fall and winter months. Representatives of several countries spoke with AM and AZ to discuss the situation.

##rallies are banned in Nagorno-Karabakh due to martial law

Gen. Samvel Babayan had planned to hold a major rally on Friday, ahead of the Saturday parliamentary vote to elect a new president. He wants the public to stop the appointment of a figure ""who will make the crisis worse"". He accused Russia of helping orchestrate the power change in Nagorno-Karabakh and not helping to resolve the conflict expediently. Some analysts are concerned that Arayik's resignation could further destabilize the internal situation and the NK-AZ borders. Details in [Thursday](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16csxuq/gen_samvel_babayans_interview_assassination/) report. 

**Nagorno-Karabakh Government:** Rallies are banned under the ongoing martial law. The participants will face legal consequences. Avoid provocations. //

The parliament is split into two camps. The majority, backed by the former regime, wants to appoint a person nominated by the former regime. The second camp is Samvel Babayan, whose party is the second largest party in parliament but falls short of enough votes to elect Babayan.

Babayan's party was not allowed to nominate Babayan for president, raising the ire of Babayan supporters. That decision was later reversed.

##Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Zakharova vents about unfair criticism and ""mud throwing"" during an Armenian-Russian media forum held in Yerevan

**ZAKHAROVA:** We are brotherly nations with a long record of cooperation. Thanks to the personal efforts of President Vladimir Putin, the 2020 war was stopped and the Nov. 9 Statement was signed, becoming a strong basis for establishing peace and normalization of relations in the region. 

Russia is Armenia's largest economic partner. We invest 40% of all capital investments amounting to $2.2 billion. We give steep discount on gas. Our railway company handles passenger and railway traffic in Armenia.

Starting in 2010, Russia has sent $70 million in humanitarian aid to Armenia via the UN.

Russian universities are educating 5,200 Armenian students, 1,800 of whom receive state subsidies from Russia. 

Our border guards help protect Armenia's borders with Turkey, Iran, and Azerbaijan.

To preserve all this, it's necessary to maintain healthy AM-RU relations. It's on the shoulders of governments and mass media. It's necessary to highlight the positives and remember the heroic accomplishments of our nations in the past.

Unfortunately, there has been a trend in Armenian media lately to circulate negative and often false information about Russia. It's against the traditionally friendly relations. //

Maria Zakharova went on to justify Russia's inaction around the Nagorno-Karabakh blockade and the invasion of Armenia proper, and criticized Armenia's decision to ban the entry of certain Russian officials and media figures like Margo.

**ZAKHAROVA:** We were shocked to hear the news about the arrest of a Sputnik reporter [Russia's state media] and the blogger Mika Badalyan [pro-Russian activist from Armenia]. //

Why were the bloggers arrested and released? Seven people were arrested in Syunik yesterday, including blogger Mika Badalyan and a Sputnik employee. They are facing charges relating to the illegal acquisition, storage, and transfer of weapons. The authorities found Kalashnikov rifles, grenades, and marijuana during the raid. The investigation began on August 24th. 

Blogger Mika Badalyan's wife (Russian) is accused of filming the location and movement of Armenian soldiers near a border town yesterday, despite numerous warnings by the army that doing so is a danger to security. The video was circulated by the Azerbaijani press.

**ZAKHAROVA:** The West does not want to protect Armenia, they just want to drive Russia out of Armenia. We are concerned about the rise of pro-Western media outlets in Armenia whose intention is to discredit Russia and AM-RU relations. There is a lot of mud-throwing instead of constructive criticism. The West promotes and finances these outlets through financial grants. //

**DMITRI PISARENKO (Sputnik's Armenia branch):** The Russian press should pay more attention to Armenia. There is a deficit of information that needs to be filled. The Russian TV channels need to cover more news about Armenia and present it to the audience based in Armenia.

##interview with analyst Karen Sargsyan 

**REPORTER:** Ukraine invited Pashinyan's wife Anna Hakobyan to [visit Kyiv](https://youtu.be/ZRVKD_h7dl8?t=1) and take part in the forum. Why now?

**KAREN:** They have always invited, and they have always requested Armenia for humanitarian assistance, but Armenia rejected it in the past. The government no longer has the option to hide its disappointment in Russia. They have finally realized that not leaving the Russian camp and instead playing complementarism is not bringing any benefits. 

The decision to donate thousands of tablets and phones to Ukraine was the right choice because Ukrainian kids have been forced to attend school remotely. This is better than sending medicine.

I knew about Hakobyan's planned trip since July. It was a long diplomatic process. 

**REPORTER:** How did Ukraine respond to her participation?

**KAREN:** Wonderfully. They sat her next to Anthony Blinken, the main VIP guest. They don't assign the seats randomly. Hakobyan's visit was the main newsmaker in the Ukrainian press. 

This is important because Azerbaijan has long been trying to portray Armenia as Russia's ally, and that only Azerbaijan was sending aid to Ukraine. Azerbaijan no longer has that card in its hand.

Azerbaijan was spending millions of dollars each month on anti-Armenian propaganda to deceive Ukraine. This week their efforts were met with a series of headlines: Armenia-US joint military exercises, Armenia recalls ambassador to CSTO, Anna Hakobyan delivers aid to Ukraine, Anna Hakobyan uses the word ""war"" and not ""special operation"", and the Armenian media sphere being flooded by anti-Russian rhetoric. This was a moral boost for Ukraine because they interpreted this as Russia getting weaker and losing its remaining friends. For them it's important that this is about Armenia and not another CSTO member.

**REPORTER:** That's what I've observed in the Ukrainian media as well. Anything about Armenia resonated far wider and faster. Why is *""tiny Armenia""* so important in this context? 

**KAREN:** Armenia's self-worth was intentionally destroyed by the Russian empire, aided by pro-Russian forces like Levon Ter-Petrosyan and ARF. Armenia was an extremely important player for the UK and France because we were controlling the flow of Western capital in the regions east of Constantinople. 

Ukraine doesn't view Armenia as tiny and unimportant. Armenians have played a significant role in Ukraine's history. Since the days of the foundation of their statehood, when there were small domains scattered around, Armenians made their contribution. There are Armenian churches in Ukraine dating back to the 13th century.

**REPORTER:** Who circulated the claim that Ukraine had supplied the white phosphorus weapons used by Azerbaijan during the 2020 war?

**KAREN:** The entire story is completely made up. No one has ever brought any evidence of any of that. There is also no evidence of chemical phosphorus being used during the 2020 war. If there is evidence of that, and Armenia hasn't bothered to send the evidence to the relevant international agencies, then someone must be tried for treason.

What we saw in videos during the 2020 war was Azerbaijan using the 120mm GRAD's 9m22s munitions. They contain thermite, not white phosphorus. It's used for burning down large areas. The thermite burns at 2,000 degrees and cannot be extinguished with water. It will burn through your skin and reach your bone, but it's not white phosphorus.

The claim that Ukraine sold white phosphorus to Azerbaijan was first made by Russian media figure WarGonzo or his colleagues. Today we all know he is just a propagandist. 

That bastard Sarik Andreasyan [a very famous Russian movie director with Armenian origins] circulated WarGonzo's rumors. The news reached Ukraine's President Zelensky who personally responded to Sarik.

**REPORTER:** How did Zelensky respond?

**KAREN:** *Are you an idiot? We didn't sell white phosphorus.* In the meantime, Arsen Avakov [ethnic Armenian], who was the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine responsible for customs and transfers, also refuted the claim. If you remember, Avakov restrained several Ukrainian parliament MPs who made [presumably anti-Armenian comments] at the start of the war. 

Ukraine has used everything in its arsenal against Russia so far. I'm sure they would have used white phosphorus if they possessed any.

White phosphorus is extremely dangerous and requires special attention. Only special chemically-trained troops can use them.

Anyone who claims Ukraine sold white phosphorus to Azerbaijan that was then used against Armenians is either 1) An idiot who fell for Russian propaganda, 2) A Russian agent tasked with damaging AM-UA relations. 

**REPORTER:** Lately we've seen reports of the accumulation of troops on the NK-AZ border. Will Azerbaijan launch the full invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh?

**KAREN:** I don't think so. Doing that would mean the removal of Russian soldiers. I doubt Azerbaijan will want to lose Russia's friendship because they need it. As long as Aliyev is on good terms with his fellow totalitarian regimes, he will be OK at home. The moment Aliyev abandons his totalitarian friends, he becomes an easy target for the West. 

The West is essentially saying that they aren't imposing sanctions on Aliyev because they don't won't him to join the Russian camp. 

Attacking Armenia now would not be beneficial for Azerbaijan politically. It's also a risky military move because there is always a chance he could sustain territorial losses, too, especially now that Armenians on both sides are desperate to lift the blockade.
 
**REPORTER:** Will Russia leave the South Caucasus region, as stated by Pashinyan?

**KAREN:** Russia has already left. Russia reached an agreement with Azerbaijan in 2011, signed it in 2016, and implemented it in 2020. The process isn't over yet. They want to establish a corridor through Syunik.

**REPORTER:** Did Russia ""sell"" the Berdzor corridor as well?

**KAREN:** Obviously. Pashinyan revealed that Russia [pressured the Nagorno-Karabakh government to withdraw from Berdzor] without the prior knowledge of Armenia. Berdzor was sold by Russia. *[This was supposed to happen 2 years later but Russia and Azerbaijan forced the process to take place earlier]* 

Historically, has Russia done anything good for Armenia? This year we mark the 245th anniversary of the 1st Armenian Genocide. The genocide of Crimean Armenians was perpetrated by Queen Yekaterina 2nd, her lover Potemkin, and scumbag Suvorov. 
There were over 40 churches and monasteries in Feodosia [Crimea], and they survived even the Ottoman Empire, but couldn't survive the Russian Empire. Why are there only 3 left, with 2 of them having been transferred to the Russian church? 

What have the Bolsheviks done for Armenia? They were trying to conduct the first [nuclear](https://anca.org/first-atom-bomb-in-ussr-created-in-armenia-reads-cia-document/) experiment in the Hrazdan river gorge. They almost signed it. Anastas Mikoyan and a few others convinced them not to.

**REPORTER:** Alen Simonyan directly accused Russia of holding Nagorno-Karabakh residents hostage. *""The country that was supposed to defend us is the one maintaining the blockade.""*

**KAREN:** That was the most important message that needs more media attention. Instead, we are flooded with videos of 8 Azeri tanks being driven in Nakhijevan. Have you seen the mountains in that direction? What are those 8 tanks going to do there? Why was that bigger news? The war of 2020 has not even ended.

**REPORTER:** It turns out that Russian citizens residing in Yerevan will be allowed to vote in the upcoming municipal elections. There are concerns Russia will ""appoint"" their person.

**KAREN:** The law allows citizens of any country, not just Russia, to participate in these elections as long as they've resided in Yerevan for 1+ year. We're talking about 11,000 people, presumably Russian. I don't know how the average Russian person would vote without speaking the language and understanding anything about our politics. Those who vote are probably agents carrying out orders.

##update: the original source of the false report about Macron's visit to Armenia was a French website 

It was posted by ""Opinion Internationale"" and quickly removed. The outlet's director had also posted his link on Twitter, contributing to the spread of the false information.

Two days later, citing its internal ""sources"", a newly created website called Alpha News with alleged links to the Kremlin claimed that Macron was going to visit Armenia. It was picked up by pro-Russian outlets and media figures before reaching the media spheres in Azerbaijan and Russia.

8/5/2022,I have had enough of this shit #3 - Russian Propaganda,"Hi ladies and gentlemen, it's time for annoying things to be discussed. Remember that it's all subjective, and feel free to argue in the comments. In fact feel free to post about things that make you crazy. Now let's go.

 Russian propaganda is the most powerful weapon Kremlin possesses. I'm not gonna go into details of how it's working, there's already a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6Vg7yLx54) about that. What i want to talk about is how it affects us. 

First and foremost, Russia tries to align its interests with our interests. In other words Russian propaganda claims that Russia wants what Armenia wants for Armenia, Russia does what is best for Armenia. Which is simply a lie. I think the last time our interests were more or less aligned was the 1990s. After Putin came into power our paths split. 

Of course it goes without saying, that Russia is Putin. He is the only one that makes the decisions. Now, there are 2 crucial things to understand. First of all Putin doesn't do what is best for Russia, he just plays his games(bloody and atrocious). 

The second key point to understand, is that Putin has his own international relations theory. In his mind, he is the king of a global superpower, and every country surrounding him, must be his vassals. He doesn't recognize anyone as an ally, only vassals, and the rights and interests of vassals are completely neglected. Now about their propaganda. 

The Russian propaganda tries to undermine every authority in the Armenia, starting from the PM, ending with mayors of cities. Everyone according to Russian propaganda is either an idiot or դավաճան, but actually both. They try to make our authorities seem untrustworthy (with some actual help from our authorities). They try to divide our society (and actually succeed). Because if you don't agree with every single word they say, you are a traitor and Turk. They try to make us, feel helpless.

 Most of this is being done via the TV, telegram channels, social networks and their brought agents(not like James Bonds, but rather pathetic pieces of shit who are actually դավաճան).

Oh, and they are always intimidating us. According to them, the war will definitely start later today, if it didn't then it must be tomorrow, or yesterday... Oh my god.. We are doomed. We all will be slaughtered, because we cannot defend ourselves, And only The great Russia can defend us, if we are being good boys over here of course...

 It also creates hostility, and tries to put us in the same ship with Russia. Ukraine is an amazing example of this. Apart from the standard arguments they use for domestic use(nazis, anti-Russia, defend our Russians inside Ukraine, etc...), there are two arguments against Ukraine made up exclusively for us. 

First of all, they can't seem to shut the fuck up about Ukraines weapon sells to Azerbaijan. However they miss the context, and a very important fact. First of all, after the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine inherited a really huuuge soviet arsenal. Being ruled by corrupt idiots(sounds familiar?), Ukraine sold almost everything, to almost everyone. A small chunk of that(worth tens of millions) bought Azerbaijan. A small amount of that from them were also bought by... Surprise.... Armenia(also worth tens of millions, but probably less than Azeris). 

Russia also hides the fact, that the weapons Ukraine sold to Azeris, were absolutely insignificant. It also forgets to mention, that around 80(worth of $5bln+ by some estimations) percent of Azeri arsenal is bought from Russia. That's right, they are the main supplier. Apart, from the high precision weapons, every significant weapon that Azeris have, they got from Russia. They also tell us, that Ukraine sold phosphorus munitions (those were probably thermite munitions i think) to Azeris, which also has absolutely no evidence (and seems almost impossible honestly). Ukraine never had those kinds of munitions(there's no evidence and it seems unlikely). A small amount of so-called phosphorus bombs Russia inherited from the Soviet Union. Apart from Russia itself some analysts suggest that Soviet Germany had a small arsenal of those which were somehow sold to Turkey at some point, to appease them. 

The second and frankly more annoying argument for us, is the special propaganda operation carried out by Russian and Azeri propaganda forces. All those fucking signs that say ""Crimea/Donbass is Russia, Artsakh is Armenia"". It's a way for Russia to put us in the same ship(shit) with them. Two cases have nothing to do with each other, and are only meant to make us support Russian annexations. What Azeri propaganda has to do with it you ask? They have their own ""Crimea/Donbass is Ukraine, Qarabakh is Azerbaijan"". And this shit, combined with Russia's shit, works amazingly well. It makes Ukrainians support Azeris and some Armenians support Russia. 

With all this being said, i want to mention, that Ukraine and Turks(also caspian turks) are actually allies. But Ukraine was(is) in a horrible geopolitical situation and has to do everything to survive, kinda like us. Especially before the last full blown invasion, the West's support was very limited, however Turkeys support was much more significant. Now, let the politicians do whatever is necessary, to trade, to say, to give everything needed, in order  to keep their nations stay afloat. As for us, people, we shouldn't hate each other. On the contrary, we should be supportive, because we are in a very similar situation.

I understand some Armenians pain, that no one gives a fuck, when we are being bombed, but Ukraine for some reason is important to Europe/USA.  That has its reasons, which I'm not going to go into here, just remember it's not Ukrainians fault that the world does not care about us.

Also worth mentioning, that all of this has nothing to do with Russian people. We have a close cultural ties, and are generally very friendly with each other, which i believe is amazing. There is no reason to be mad at them either, because they have nothing to do with their state policy.

This was a pretty long text, and i'm not good at writing long texts, or texts, or writing... Anyway.  
I hope it deserved your attention.",1

Hâlbuki bu, Adana esnaflarıyla yapılan konuşmadan cımbızlanan bir laftır. Konuşmanın bütünü, içeriğiyle ve yapıldığı dönemdeki tarihsel bağlamla ele alındığında görülecektir ki; bu sözlerin Ermeni tehciriyle hiçbir alakası yoktur ve burada iki şey kastedilmiştir. 


1) Osmanlı döneminde sanata önem verilmeyişinden ve müslüman sanatkârların desteklenmeyişinden ötürü müslüman kesim sanattan mahrum kalmış & müslüman sanatkârların sayısı azalmıştı. Bu politikanın bir sonucu olarak sanat gayri müslimlerin tekeline girmiş ve hatta gayri müslimler sanat ocaklarımızı ve memleketi sahiplenir bir duruma gelmişti. Bu, haksızlık ve küstahsızlıktı. Ne Ermeniler ne başka yabancı unsurlar Türk kültürünü, sanatını, memleketini yok sayamaz, bunlar üzerinde hak iddia edemezdi. Burada Ermeniler, gayri müslimlere ve yabancı unsurlara örnek olarak verilmiştir; özellikle Ermeni milleti hedef alınmamıştır. Bakınız konuşmadan direkt alıntılar yapıyorum 'şunlar, bunlar, Ermeniler sanat ocaklarımızı işgal etmişler' 'Memleket en sonunda yine gerçek sahiplerinin elinde karar kıldı. Ermeniler ve diğerlerinin burada hiçbir hakkı yoktur' . Yabancı unsurlara örnek olarak Ermenilerin adının geçmesi ise konuşmanın Adana'da geçiyor oluşundandır; bu cephede Fransızlara ve Ermenilere karşı savaşılmıştı. 


2) 21 Mart 1923'te yapılan bu konuşmadan 2-3 sene evvel Ermeniler, Fransızların desteğiyle bu bölgede bir devlet kurmayı amaçlamıştı. Kilikya (Cilicia) bölgesinde kurulması amaçlanan bu devlet Osmaniye, Adana, İçel ve çevre bölgelerini kapsıyordu. 20 Ekim 1921 Ankara Antlaşması ile Fransız işgali son bulmuştu. Yani bu konuşmada aynı zamanda Anadolunun Türkiye Devletine ait olduğu, Ermenilerin bu topraklarda hak iddia edemeyeceği ve burada bir Ermeni devleti kurulamayacağı vurgulanıyor. 


Görüldüğü üzere Atatürk bu sözünü ne 1915 olayları üzerine söylemiştir ne de bu sözle Türkiyeli Ermenilerin hukuksal haklarını vs. kastetmiştir. Bu nedenle böyle yanlı ve yanlış veriler kara propagandadır & vikipedi vandalizmidir.

EDİT: Bir kardeşimiz Wiki Quote sayfasındaki bilgi kirliliğini düzeltmiş. Ve bu cımbızlanmış ve bağlamından koparılan propaganda kaldırılmış.

EDİT 2: Birisi tekrar eski hâline getirmiş. Arkadaşlar bazen bu şekilde birkaç karşılıklı editleşmeden sonra 'vandalizmden korumak için' diye makaleler kilitlenebiliyor ve yanlış bilgi ile kalabiliyor. Şu an kilitlemeye çalıştıklarını sanmıyoruz ama yine de sözü direkt silmeyelim. Direkt silmek yerine olayın başını sonunu anlatalım discussion & talk kısmında. Benim önerilerim: 
1) 'Reading Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Patterns of prejudice' kısmına kaynak gösterilmesini veya kaldırılmasını talep edelim discussion kısmından çünkü konuşma Adanada sanatkâr esnaflarla yapılan bir konuşma, 1915 ile alakası yok. 
2) konuşmanın neyle ilgili olduğunun açıklama olarak quote altına yazılmasını talep edelim, mesela 'As quoted in Hâkimiyeti Milliye, 21 Mart 1923. Regarding the succesfull Turkish defense against Armenian-French invasions & land claims over Cilicia/Southern Anatolia and Armenians along with other foreign elements taking over and claiming rights over Ottomans-Turkeys art quarries.' gibi. Buna kaynak olarak ilk başta attığım linkteki full konuşma metnini gösterebiliriz. 
3) bence çeviri çok taraflı yapılmış, daha doğru bir çeviri için önerim: Armenians have no rights over this fertile country. The homeland belongs to you, to Turks. This homeland belonged to Turks in history, so therefore it is Turkish and it will remain Turkish forever. 
Arkadaşlar sizler de önerilerinizi yazın ve maddeyi editleyerek direkt silmek yerine discussion kısmında hepimizin sunduğu önerileri öne sürebiliriz. Böylelikle sağlıklı bir tartışma ortamında bu sorunu çözebiliriz. Benim wikipedia hesabım yok ayrıca, wikipediada daha deneyimli arkadaşlarımız bizi nasıl bir yol izlememiz gerektiği konusunda yönlendirsinler lütfen.",1

(yeah ironic). He made multiple statements about Artsakh being Azerbaijani territory and Azerbaijan having the right to carry out whatever operation it wants on its own territory. 

""I want to say again if a provocation like this is repeated again, the response will be harsher, they will be more sorry, they will cry for help louder. But I say again, our intention is not to start a new war. It's enough. We have achieved what we wanted.""

With the Russian side too busy in Ukraine to do any sort of mediation, the French side seemingly vanished and the US side soon to focus on midterm elections, I feel that Aliyev will plan either an invasion of Armenia or start fights throughout the Syunik border to force Armenia to give him a corridor.",1

##equal party 

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan believed that by recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan it would be possible to use international mechanisms to ensure the rights and protections of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. Why did this strategy fail?

**RULING MP:** Armenia did everything possible to help organize negotiations between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan under a Western format with international mechanisms. These negotiations did not take place for obscure reasons. We witnessed a coup in Nagorno-Karabakh. The organizers of the coup claimed that the replacement of the government would *improve* Nagorno-Karabakh's security. But it unfolded differently and they capitulated within a few days. They should have followed Armenia's advice and agreed to negotiate. *[Nagorno-Karabakh rejected the first offer, Azerbaijan rejected the second offer]*

**REPORTER:** Samvel Babayan was holding separate negotiations with Azerbaijan. What can you tell us about his 23-point document?

**RULING MP:** Samvel Babayan realized where this was all headed so he organized his own initiative as a last-ditch effort. He was able to reach certain agreements with Azerbaijan but official Stepanakert was still dismissive.

**REPORTER:** How was Babayan able to find a common language with Azerbaijan?

**RULING MP:** By not being a [Russian] agent.

**ARTAK BEGLARYAN:** Artsakh President’s decree on dissolving the Republic is illegitimate: (1) No President has the power to dissolve the Republic formed by the people with referendum; (2) That decree was signed as a result of Azerbaijani aggression & threat of force. It’s null & void.

##Armenian parliament leader accuses Russia of adopting the same language as Turkey and Azerbaijan; accuses [Russia] of having ""lust for power"" against Ukraine and attempting to overthrow the Armenian government

Alen Simonyan is in Dublin for the European Conference of Presidents of Parliament.

**SIMONYAN:** The challenges facing liberalism and representative democracy are profound. Robust solutions are imperative. 

Look no further than the war in Ukraine to witness the lust for power throughout the world, through the instrument of force. This anti-democratic regression occurs to the detriment of human rights and conflicts with the collective values outlined in the European Convention on Human Rights.

We are acutely aware of the pivotal role that democracy plays in safeguarding human rights and promoting the common good. 
Among the threats that undermine the foundations of this political order are autocratic governance and justice unrealized. 

Armenia knows the value of true democracy. The fortification of democracy through the strengthening of institutions, legislative improvements, and reforms in governance is a priority for us. Our commitment to democratic principles was the most significant factor enabling us to overcome the serious political crisis resulting from the devastating 44-day war instigated by Azerbaijan against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. 

Peace and democracy are interlinked, and governments facing existential threats are under enormous pressure to realize the mandates they were elected to carry out. The war in Nagorno-Karabakh revealed that autocratic regimes, based on the notion that “might is right,” often resolve conflicts through military force, bypassing international mediation.

Today, our democracy continues to face numerous tests. It is endangered by external factors - none greater than military threats to our security and territorial integrity. Understandably, the constant threat of violence has a dire effect on the welfare of our society. Through its drumbeat of hateful, xenophobic rhetoric - accompanied by ultimatums and military aggression - Azerbaijan has created a toxic atmosphere and poisoned the peace process.

Feckless responses from the international community have created in Azerbaijan a sense of impunity, worsening the situation in the region. 

Azerbaijani actions are not confined to Nagorno-Karabakh but extend to the sovereign territories of Armenia, some of which remain under Azerbaijan’s control. Azerbaijan’s approach is to impose its preferred solutions on Armenia through force.

I was not surprised that our Turkish colleague approved the use of military force against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh. I am not surprised that Turkiye, Azerbaijan and Russia are often using the same rhetoric. What I am surprised by is that they are doing so here, at the organization that was founded for the protection of human rights.

Despite the presence of the Russian peacekeepers, Azerbaijan unleashed another large-scale military attack against Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. As I speak, in fulfillment of Azerbaijan’s ethnic cleansing plan, the exodus of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, is underway.

Through its actions, which minimized international efforts to build peace in the South Caucasus, Azerbaijan has called into question its fitness to be a member of the Council of Europe.

October 5th meeting in Granada will be a step forward. Armenia strongly endorses peace. We welcome future transport arrangements that respect the principles of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and reciprocity. We call on the international community, including the Council of Europe, to support this process.

Today, a hybrid war is being waged by certain countries against Armenia. Its goals are twofold: overthrow the democratically elected government and discredit the notion of representative democracy itself. 

Democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights, and peaceful co-existence are the pillars upon which humankind should live in peace and harmony. This is true not only within democratic states individually but also among them collectively. Together - and perhaps only together - can we prevail over the troubles of our time. The center must hold. //

##several Armenian NGOs urge the government to immediately withdraw from CSTO, remove the Russian military base, and counter Russia's attempts to destabilize Armenia internally 

**NGOs:** Since the signing of the Nov. 9 agreement, Russia has repeatedly failed to follow its obligations and has chosen to side with Azerbaijan repeatedly. Lately, Russia has been destabilizing Armenia and threatening its sovereignty. We demand the government of Armenia to:

(1) Thwart all attempts by Russia to intervene in our internal political processes.

(2) Cancel all AM-RU television re-broadcasting agreements. Require cable operators to shut down Russian channels that are engaged in anti-Armenia propaganda or broadcast calls against the sovereignty of Armenia. 

(3) Launch an official process to withdraw from CSTO. Create necessary conditions to increase military-technical cooperation with the West.

(4) Transfer all border duties to Armenian agents in Zvartnots airport, AM-TR and AM-IR borders, as stipulated by the 1991 AM-RU agreement.

(5) Launch an official process to withdraw the 102nd Russian military base from Armenia.

##interview with Informed Citizens NGO chief Daniel Ioannesian 

**REPORTER:** An outlet with ties to the Armenian government reports that Armenia wants Russia to return the $400M that was transferred for purchasing weapons. The sum was paid 2 years ago, well before the Ukraine war, yet even then Russia failed to deliver them. Russia reportedly doesn't want to return the funds because the ""contracts have not been canceled yet"". How accurate is this report?

**DANIEL:** I can verify that Armenia has transferred $400M and received nothing so far. Sure, the delivery of *some* of the weapons was expected to take years, but according to the contracts, Russia should have delivered $150M in arms by now. It's overdue. I don't think it will ever arrive. (1) Russia doesn't want to arm the Armenian army. (2) Russia itself needs those weapons. 

$400M is not a small sum. We have alternative markets today. If we leave the CSTO, other markets can offer better options. No Western official in their right mind would want to risk selling serious weapons to a country that's formally associated with Russia. 

**REPORTER:** Can Armenia nationalize Russian assets, companies owned and operated by the Russian state, if they refuse to refund it?

**DANIEL:** Գույք պարտքի դիմաց *[a reference to Kocharyan handing over Armenian infrastructure to Russia ""to pay off the debt""]*. I'm not an expert in that field. It's a legal issue. Can we enter arbitration or not. I don't know.

**REPORTER:** Russia believes Armenia is not a good ally.

**DANIEL:** Seriously? The issues with Russia began after it refused to acknowledge and condemn the invasion of Armenia proper by Azerbaijan, despite having contractual obligations. Not a single CSTO country helped Armenia. Can you imagine if NATO acted this spinelessly? Even after everything Turkey had done to piss off the West, they still supported Turkey when it faced terror threats. 

What else is Armenia supposed to do to please Russia? We have given them our nuclear field, railways, gas monopoly, ownership of pipes, an effective monopoly in electricity exports, and a membership to the EAEU that is actually harmful to us. If we exit the EAEU right now, the prices of many products on our shelves will plummet by 10%-80%. What else does Russia want us to give them?

**REPORTER:** To give them our membership in the Russian Union with Belarus.

**DANIEL:** [Dick] is what we should give them.

**REPORTER:** Why is there a crisis in AM-RU relations?

**DANIEL:** It's obvious now that the only thing Russia can give us is enmity. Armenia is taking steps to show the West that Armenia's position has changed. We need Western support right now. But the West is very cautious because they have been f&%ked over by Serj once. Serj spent 3.5 years negotiating with the EU to then make a U-turn and join Russia. It was a serious damage to Armenia's reputation as a trustworthy partner. That is what I hear a lot, including very recently from a German official.

**REPORTER:** What can the West do for Armenia?

**DANIEL:** (1) Military-technical cooperation, (2) Energy independence, (3) Economic cooperation and easier exports to Europe.

Our food producers will face major issues if Russia bans Armenian products. Russia will obviously use this tool to pressure us. We need Europe as an alternative destination. We need Europe to help us increase production and quality standards. 

As for energy, the EU can help us through various programs. Low-interest loans for solar panel installations, energy-efficient construction and renovation, etc. Europe should help us with 2-3 large energy projects:

Build a large electricity storage facility. Our nuclear plant produces a fixed amount of energy at all times. Its nighttime production is not being used. To make things worse, if we build a new nuclear plant with a 2x capacity, the utilization of nighttime production will become an even bigger problem. We need to store that electricity somewhere. Don't think of it like battery storage. It should be a facility. Let's say two reservoirs at different altitudes. The nighttime electricity could be used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir. During the daytime, when we need more electricity, the water can pour back into the lower reservoir and generate electricity like a hydropower plant. *[might as well connect a power strip to itself for unlimited energy]*.

Armenia must join the proposed Azerbaijan-Georgia-Romania-Hungary electric network and export electricity to Europe. We will be in a better position than Georgia and Azerbaijan. We could sell the nighttime excess electricity to Europe. //

##Indian engineers are building reinforced border positions: Andranik Kocharyan, ranking ruling MP

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan and Turkey want a ""Zangezur corridor"". 

**ANDRANIK:** No corridor. Stop beating a dead horse. I don't know why they still call it that way. 

Our best protection is our army and strong borders. One of these days I'm going to invite every media outlet and take you to the southern borders so you can see the new engineering structures. I want you to *feel* the amount of dedicated work that was done over the past several months.

Indian workers were part of this process. They are my brothers. They are doing something that many Armenians didn't want to do. We must have engineering squads, we must take care of our state, and we must feel like we own our country.

I spoke with Samvel Babayan shortly before his departure to Armenia. I urged him to be careful and not get arrested while entering Armenia. He said he won't get arrested, but if he does, he will ""take a few Azeris with him to Armenia"". Babayan and Azerbaijani authorities have a complicated history dating back to the 1st war. //

##Կենացները քաղցրանում են։ Hayk Marutyan is facing a dillema 

The context is in [Thursday report](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16uv5ol/armenias_defense_budget_to_reach_14b_exodus/): The shaky alliance between the 3 opposition forces fell apart yesterday. Marutyan, the lead candidate for Yerevan mayor, has called for new elections after learning that Dog's party could not secure enough votes for his appointment. In order for new elections to be held, the 33 opposition Council members (trio) must unanimously boycott the first session. Marutyan fears that if at least one of Dog's members shows up, the Council will have the quorum to organize a session and elect the ruling party's Tigran Avinyan as the mayor. 

##... new developments 

Dog is holding Marutyan hostage. He wants Marutyan and the former regime to sign a 3-way contract. In exchange for helping to boycott the first session and triggering new elections, Dog wants written guarantees that his party members will be appointed to lead a third of all Yerevan districts.

Marutyan had earlier categorically refused to sign any formal contract with them. He has until October 10 to decide.

If Marutyan refuses, Dog could ""help"" Avinyan get elected while settling for minority seats and calling it a day. But if Dog triggers new elections, it's a big gamble because he risks being wiped out in the event of higher voter turnout. Avinyan suddenly has a chance to become the mayor if Dog chickens out.

7/19/2020,"Debunking the myth propagated by Turkish and Azeri government PR that Armenia is a horrible place to live compared to their countries and is on the brink of collapse. As you'll see below, in reality Armenia is miles ahead of both of these countries in a lot of ways and roughly equal in some others","I'm sure you've encountered a Turkish or Azeri person on the internet who can't stop talking about how Armenia is dying of hunger, that there's so much repression that living here is worse than North Korea and that it's so bad people would rather live in South Sudan instead.

It's not accidental the population thinks like this. The narrative has been constructed over 2 decades by Turkish and Azeri state propaganda. On state TV and media, they constantly portray Armenia as being on the verge of famine and collapse.

People who live in Armenia or tourists that have visited the country of course know that these are absolute lies that have nothing to do with reality.

But the amount of mostly Turkish and Azeri people that actually believe these myth is hilariously large.

So what can we do to help the more rational segments in the Turkish and Azeri societies to see through the propaganda? Simply saying it's propaganda isn't enough. The common answer is ""you're lying!"".

Normally I *really* wouldn't care about this kind of comparisons but just for educational purposes, let's present some data by international organizations to see the real picture.

# The 2019 Legatum Prosperity Index

The Legatum Prosperity Index is a framework that assesses countries on the promotion of their residents’ flourishing, reflecting both economic and social wellbeing. It captures the richness of a truly prosperous life, moving beyond traditional macroeconomic measurements of a nation’s prosperity, which rely solely on indicators of wealth such as average income per person (GDP per capita). It redefines the way success is measured, changing the conversation from what we are getting, to who we are becoming. This makes it an authoritative measure of human progress, offering a unique insight into how prosperity is forming and changing across nearly all countries of the world.

In short, there are 12 pillars of prosperity:

**Safety & Security:** measures the degree to which conflict, terror, and crime have destabilised the security of individuals, both immediately and through longer lasting effects.

**Personal Freedom:** measures country-wide progress towards basic legal rights, individual liberties, and social tolerance.

**Governance pillar:** measures the extent to which there are checks and restraints on power and whether governments operate effectively and without corruption.

**Social Capital**: measures the strength of personal and social relationships, social norms, and civic participation in a country.

**Investment Environment:** measures the extent to which investments are adequately protected and are readily accessible.

**Enterprise Conditions**: measures the degree to which regulations enable businesses to start, compete, and expand.

**Market Access & Infrastructure**: measures the quality of the infrastructure that enables trade, and distortions in the market for goods and services.

**Economic Quality**: measures how well a state’s economy is equipped to generate wealth sustainably and with the full engagement of its workforce.

**Living Conditions**: measures the degree to which a reasonable quality of life is experienced by all, including material resources, shelter, basic services, and connectivity.

**Health**: measures the extent to which people are healthy and have access to the necessary services to maintain good health, including health outcomes, healthy systems, illness and risk factors, and mortality rates.

**Education**: measures enrolment, outcomes, and quality across four stages of education (pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary education), as well as the skills in the adult population.

**Natural Environment**: measures the aspects of the physical environment that have a direct effect on people in their daily lives and changes that might impact the prosperity of future generations.

If you're interested about the methodology details, you can read more about it [here](https://www.prosperity.com/about/methodology).

[Here's the full ranking of countries with Armenia, Turkey and Azerbaijan pinned at the top](https://www.prosperity.com/rankings?pinned=ARM,AZE,TUR&filter=).

*Armenia is ahead of both Turkey and Azerbaijan in 6 out of 12 pillars. It's ahead of at least one of the two in 8 out of 12 pillars.*

# The 2019 Democracy Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit

Intends to measure the state of democracy in 167 countries, of which 166 are sovereign states and 164 are UN member states.

The democracy index is a weighted average based on the answers of 60 questions, each one with either two or three permitted alternative answers. Most answers are experts' assessments. Some answers are provided by public-opinion surveys from the respective countries. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar countries, and expert assessments are used in order to fill in gaps.

The questions are grouped into five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture.

[For more details, check this link](https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index).

*According to EIU, in 2019:*

* *Armenia is the* ***86th*** *most democratic country*
* *Turkey* ***110th***
* *Azerbaijan* ***146th***

# The 2020 Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index

The degree of freedom available to journalists in 180 countries is determined by pooling the responses of experts to a questionnaire devised by RSF. This qualitative analysis is combined with quantitative data on abuses and acts of violence against journalists during the period evaluated. The criteria evaluated in the questionnaire are pluralism, media independence, media environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, and the quality of the infrastructure that supports the production of news and information.

[Detailed methodology here](https://rsf.org/en/detailed-methodology).

*According to RPW, in 2019*

* *Armenia has the* ***61st*** *freest press*
* *Turkey* ***154th***
* *Azerbaijan* ***168th***

&#x200B;

# The 2019 Freedom House Freedom on the Net Index

Freedom House assesses the level of internet freedom in 65 countries around the world through its annual Freedom on the Net report, examining issues including connectivity, blocking and filtering, and users’ risk of arrest or assault in reprisal for their online activity.

[More information](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net).

*According to FH, in 2019 (score out of 100)*

* *Armenia* ***76/100*** *(8th freest in the world)*
* *Azerbaijan* ***39/100***
* *Turkey* ***37/100***

&#x200B;

# World Bank 2019 GDP per Capita (current US$) data

[Graph with the 3 countries](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=AM-AZ-TR).

*Turkey -* ***9,042***

*Azerbaijan -* ***4,793***

*Armenia -* ***4,622***

Turkey's figure is about twice higher and Azerbaijan's pretty much the same as Armenia.

&#x200B;

# Workd Bank 2019 GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)

[Graph with the 3 countries](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=AM-AZ-TR).

*Turkey -* ***27,875***

*Azerbaijan -* ***15,000***

*Armenia -* ***14,219***

Again, Turkey's figure is almost twice higher. Armenia and Azerbaijan at the same level.

&#x200B;

# What did we learn?

Turkey's economy is more developed than Azerbaijan's and Armenia's. Armenia and Azerbaijan have almost equally developed economies despite Azerbaijan sitting on huge amounts of natural resources.

On the other hand, regarding governance, personal freedom, media and internet freedom, social capital, Armenia is a long away ahead of both Turkey and Azerbaijan.

10/3/2020,Iranian here and I fully support Armenia,"They aren't our ""shia brothers"" when they fund separatist movements in our country and shout racist rhetorics insulting every other ethnic group in our country. But as soon as they need Iran, they start bringing islam into the mix.

In reality we all know that this isn't a christian vs muslim war. It's a war to try and erase Armenian identity as they already tried to do so once before. Most Iranian azeri's that aren't brainwashed by the pan-turk propaganda also agree with this and don't support azerbaijan in this conflict so I hope you guys can seperate them from the usual azerbaijan crowd. 

That said the protests in iran are barely in thousands and some of them are directly done so by the government to try and cause confusion (as irans economy is very bad nowdays). Iran has 15-20 million Turks and a huge majority of them are supporting Armenia or are neutral. 

Just letting it go out there.",1
2/24/2022,PSA: Remember we aren't going to have any idea how the wars going for a while,"All of you should remember the Second Nagorno-Karabacht war and the monumental amounts of propaganda both sides were churning out. Nobody knew who was actually winning until Arstakh defense forces were shattered and heading to the peace table. 

Neither let their casualties be known, and both played up their kills on the field to make it sound like they were winning more. I think by October Azerbaijan was claiming to have destroyed more AFVs than actually existed in Armenia. 

That propaganda mud fight was carried out by two developing nations with 3rd rate military forces. This is one being fought by two nations with decades of institutional experience in Psy-ops and propaganda, so take everything you see and hear with a grain of salt unless it's been verified by credible third party sources. 

If you're in the Ukraine, please stay safe.",1
9/27/2023,The US propagandist in ep 397,"I just listened to ep 397, about the Nagorno-Karabach war, and I gotta say I'm a bit disgusted. The way they presented the guest as a **""really great journalist*** ^who ^writes ^for ^rfe-rl **welcome Joshua Kucera!""** with no mention of the fact that he's a creature of the US propaganda machinery. Of course a lot of listeners will catch that, but not all of them will have noticed of perhaps even know what Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is. Not being clear about who he is and what he represents is shameful in my opinion.

He played his role well though. ""Oh, I'm certainly not defending Azerbaijan, but you see it's such a *nuanced* situation, there's a lot of *nuance!* Anyway we can probably blame Russia, or maybe Russia and Armenia."" Almost worse that Ben Aris.",1
4/3/2023,"US Summit for Democracy, Tegh Village, International Court Štěpán Grigoryan","I hope people here watch this.

The amount of Kremlin fear mongering propaganda that I saw in the past few days spread here is disturbing, to say the least. I don't understand how the mods are allowing those posts and talking points, they are the definition of low level engagement. 

I see many either falling, or on purpose spreading, the  Russian propaganda that ""we are angering Russia with Rome Statute and we have no benefits just negatives"". 

Here is Stepan Grigoryan's analysis on the whole situation. Unlike us here, he is doing this for a living, and he is very well connected in the government and abroad. He is always participating in international summits with foreign diplomats and experts. He is one of the most objective experts in Armenia. 

Main points are how important the Rome Statute ratification for us is.

How Armenia fucked up by only partially joining the 17 point declaration made during the Biden's Democracy summit, and how we immediately paid the price politically and physically.

I know most people here don't like to sit and watch nearly hour long analysis in Armenian. However I notice how many people like to come in hot takes. I say if we gonna come in hot, the price should be listening to people who know what they are talking about.",1

We all agree a breakaway state is pointless, so I genuinely don’t understand why the option of the Armenians in the Armenian separatist territory (not including the territories where Azeris were ethnically cleansed in the 90s by Armenian soldiers) let them join as a part of Armenia with a Lachin corridor (owned by Azerbaijan, controlled by Turkey) connecting it to Armenia proper and a Zangezur corridor (owned by Armenia, controlled by a foreign power like France or Russia or America) connecting Nahkchivan to Azerbaijan proper… to me this seems like the most logical solution that would result in long term peace and least problems. It is clear to me that the Armenians currently in Nagorno-Karabakh are unwilling to be a part of Azerbaijan, so I don’t see why Azerbaijan would go through the trouble of trying to pacify them.

11/11/2020,Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement,"*This thread lists details about the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement and all questions about it should be asked in this comment section and not as a separate post.*  


On 9 November 2020, a ceasefire was signed between Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan brokered by Russian President Vladimir Putin officially ending the second Nagorno-Karabakh war.  


Details and the terms of the agreement:  


1. A complete ceasefire and end to all hostilities in the Karabakh conflict from 00:00 Moscow time on November 10 2020. The Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia, hereinafter referred to as the parties stop at the positions they occupy.
2. [Aghdam District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agdam_District) returns to the Republic of Azerbaijan by November 20 2020.
3. Along the contact line in Nagorno-Karabakh and along the [Lachin corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachin_corridor) there will be a peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation in the amount of 1960 military personnel with small arms, 90 armoured personnel carriers, 380 automotive units and special equipment.
4. The peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation is deployed in parallel with the withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces. The duration of the peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation is 5 years with automatic renewal for the next 5 year periods if none of the parties state otherwise 6 months in advance.
5. In order to improve the effectiveness of control over the implementation by the Parties to the conflict agreements, a peacekeeping centre is being deployed to control the ceasefire.
6. The Republic of Armenia will return to Azerbaijan the [Kalbajar District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalbajar_District) by November 15th 2020 and the [Lachin District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachin_District) by December 1st. The [Lachin corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachin_corridor) (5 km (3.1 mi) wide) which will provide communication to Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, without affecting the town of [Shusha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shusha) remains under the control of the peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Federation. By agreement of the Parties, a construction plan will be determined in the next three years for a new route of movement along the Lachin corridor, providing a link between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia with the subsequent redeployment of the Russian peacekeeping contingent to guard this route. The Republic of Azerbaijan guarantees the safety of traffic along the Lachin corridor of citizens, vehicles, and goods in both directions.
7. Internally displaced persons and refugees return to the territories of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent areas under the control of the [UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Office_of_the_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees).
8. The exchange of prisoners of war is to be made, hostages, and other detainees as well as the remains of casualties.
9. All economic and transport links in the region are to be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia guarantees the safety of transport links between western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to organise the unimpeded movement of citizens, vehicles and cargo in both directions. Transport control is carried out by the bodies of the Border Service of the FSB of Russia. By agreement of the Parties, the construction of new transport communications linking the [Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic) with regions of Azerbaijan is to take place.  


**TLDR:**   


* Armenian forces leave Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding districts completely. Parts of Nagorno-Karabakh captured by Azerbaijan during the war ([Shusha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shusha), [Hadrut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrut), [Azykh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azokh), [Suqovuşan (Madagiz)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagiz)) and other smaller towns/villages) will remain under full Azerbaijani control and administration.   

* Remaining parts of Nagorno-Karabakh ([Khankendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepanakert), [Khojavend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojavend_(town)), [Aghdara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martakert), [Khojaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojaly_(town))) will have Russian peacekeepers. The details about the administration of these places are not public yet, but it is known that it won't be Armenia or the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh.   

* Azerbaijan will get a road to Nakhchivan through Armenia. The road will be controlled by Russian peacekeepers.  

* There are rumours about Turkish peacekeepers, but it is not confirmed yet. Even if there are no Turkish peacekeepers, strong Turkish presence in the conflict and South Caucasus is expected.  

* Russia will stay in the remaining parts of Nagorno-Karabakh for 5 years. This period will be renewed for another 5 years if no side objects after the first 5 years.  

* All surrounding districts will be returned to Azerbaijan until 1 December.

 Global freedom faces a dire threat. Around the world, the enemies of liberal democracy—a form of self-government in which human rights are recognized and every individual is entitled to equal treatment under law—are accelerating their attacks. Authoritarian regimes have become more effective at co-opting or circumventing the norms and institutions meant to support basic liberties, and at providing aid to others who wish to do the same. In countries with long-established democracies, internal forces have exploited the shortcomings in their systems, distorting national politics to promote hatred, violence, and unbridled power. Those countries that have struggled in the space between democracy and authoritarianism, meanwhile, are increasingly tilting toward the latter. The global order is nearing a tipping point, and if democracy’s defenders do not work together to help guarantee freedom for all people, the authoritarian model will prevail. 

Freedom scores (higher=better):

- Armenia: 54/100

- **Nagorno-Karabakh: 37/100**

- Turkey: 32/100

- Russia: 12/100

- Azerbaijan: 9/100

As I understand it, this conflict is not very ""unique"". People from two nations have been living on a piece of land, and now they can't decide who it belongs to. However, unlike places like Israel and Kashmir, where similar conflicts happen, it seems to me (an outsider and layman) that the two peoples have quite a lot in common AND both countries could benefit from uniting. There isn't a huge power imbalance between the two, so it's not like one would leech off the other. By uniting, people could keep living where they live, fighting would stop, and they could be a stronger country overall. Of course the big neighbors would not like this, but they are already making too much money on this conflict.

Is this just daydreaming? What are the holes in this theory? If I am wrong on something, please don't be upset, but tell me about it. I never intended to pick a side or spread misinformation.

Edit: thanks for all the replies everybody! I suspected from the start that just asking the fighters to put down the weapons wouldn't work. After all, a war is what neither part wants, but it has led to this anyway. But reading all your replies and links to resources is really interesting, this is a part of the world I already knew little about.",1

**The Cause and Effect:**  The blast took place at a fuel storage site near Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, and reportedly injured over 200 people.
* The cause of the blast is yet to be determined, but it occurred while locals were lining up for fuel to leave the region.
* Many of the victims were described as being in ""severe or extremely severe"" condition, necessitating air evacuation for medical treatment.


**Political Background:**  The explosion followed a quick offensive by Azerbaijan last week, reestablishing their control over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region after three decades of separatist rule.
* Thousands of ethnic Armenians fled to Armenia, fearing reprisals following the handover.
* As per Armenia's government, more than 6,500 Nagorno-Karabakh residents have sought refuge, while Russian peacekeepers in the region have helped in the evacuation.


**International Response:**  Nations and organizations worldwide have expressed their concern and offered aid in response to the situation.
* French President Emmanuel Macron pledged assistance in terms of food and medical aid for Nagorno-Karabakh and vowed to work towards a ""sustainable peace"" in the region.
* The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Samantha Power, visited Armenia to show U.S. support for Armenia's sovereignty and independence and assist in addressing humanitarian needs caused by recent violence.
* The UN also expressed its worry over the increase in influx into Armenia and offered to provide assistance and conduct humanitarian needs assessments if permitted access to the region.


**The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh:**  The Nagorno-Karabakh region, disputed by Armenia and Azerbaijan, has seen decades of conflict since Armenian-backed forces took control in 1994.
* Azerbaijan recently reclaimed the area and accused the Armenian government of using a key road for illegal activities, leading to a 10-month blockade.
* Turmoil continues as Russia's efforts to maintain peace in the region are questioned, and Turkish President Erdogan declares support for its ally Azerbaijan.

##war against Kemalist Turkey and Bolshevik Russia: ex-PM of Armenia and ex-mayor of Tbilisi Alexander Khatisian recalls the struggles for independence during the First Republic 

**KHATISIAN:** Upon my arrival in [Gyumri] I developed personal impressions of the situation at the frontline and the general mood in the population. The situation was sad. There was no enthusiasm. No one believed in our victory. 

We received a briefing from commanders from the Kars-Gyumri region. Our assaults on Turkish troops were unsuccessful. 

We proceeded to Yerevan. The city had its usual appearance. The railway traffic was slowed down to prioritize military trains. I met the political and military leadership to discuss the situation on the frontline.

Commanders Nazarbekyan and Hakhverdyan reported that despite the unsuccessful assault on Turkish forces, our army still had sufficient stamina. Simon Vratsyan had just arrived from Kars. He was under the impression that our forces were in a great mood but their commanders were weak and lacked leadership skills.

I asked the commanders how long Kars could withstand as a castle. They estimated two months. Upon learning details about the enemy army, I expressed my opinion that the war should continue. 

The council issued multiple orders to strengthen our defense. Everyone went home in a good mood. Kars was standing. Dro's forces were holding the enemy back in Surmalu. 

[...]

Our government was negotiating with the Soviet Union [Bolsheviks] to secure the most favorable conditions: 1) Independence for Armenia, 2) Annexation of Turkish-controlled Armenian vilayets. In return, Russia wanted to have all sorts of transit rights via Armenia. 

We were approaching the fateful day of October 30. But before that, let me share with you the memo sent to me by our diplomat Tigran Bekzadyan written in August 1920. It describes the situation on the ground.

##... the memo by BEKZADYAN, Armenia's ambassador to Georgia; classification: secret:

Your Excellency. It has become imperative for Armenia and Georgia to establish foreign relations with Bolsheviks after their invasion of Azerbaijan and the Northern Caucasus. The Russian government had hinted that they would respond favorably to Armenia's request for independence if Armenia offered a peace deal.

An Armenian delegation was dispatched to Moscow on May 5. *[apparently, it took 15 days to reach Moscow]*. Our goal was to convince Soviet Russia to recognize our independence, and not to intervene in our internal and foreign policies. These negotiations have not yielded any results so far.

There are several factors that contributed to these delays in negotiations, with the primary ones being:

(1) Kemalists [Turkey] are fighting against the Entante states and the peace agreement [the West]. They want to receive assistance from Russia and Azerbaijan, by using Armenian lands. They view Armenia as an obstacle to creating a monotonous Muslim state stretching from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. Kemalists also want, with the help of Bolshevik Russia, to challenge the Western dominance in the East and Asia.

(2) Russia wants to establish a connection to Kemalist forces to use them to destroy Western capital and dominance in the East and Asia. Russia also wants to connect to Iran by using Armenian territories.

In both scenarios, Armenia is the main obstacle to the implementation of these programs. Lately, we've seen more attempts by Bolsheviks and Azeris to implement their plans. 

Kemalists and Azeris have focused on the borders with Armenia. On the other side, the Russian Bolsheviks, under the pretense of applying preventative measures to prevent the Armenian-Azeri conflict from causing international clashes, have invaded Karabakh, Syunik, and Nakhijevan. The Kemalist-Azeri forces have also entered these regions. 

But that didn't last long, and the Bolsheviks were pushed out. They proceeded to receive reinforcements from the Soviet army in Karabakh and the Kurdish cavalry from north-eastern Syunik. Our troops were outnumbered and were forced to retreat to Bazarcha/Sharur, where they were cornered and assaulted again from all directions by Bolsheviks, Kurds, Azeris, and Molokans. Dro's tiny army was unable to withstand.

Bolsheviks concentrated their forces near Gazakh [presumably Tavush region]. They assaulted unquestionably Armenian ~~regions~~ villages, invading several of them. This movement threatened to cut off our railway communication and completely neutralize it.

We passed this information to the Georgian government. The latter sent a note of protest to Moscow about its assault on Armenia. 

Concerned over the prospect of losing the aforementioned regions, the Armenian government decided to expedite the peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Bolsheviks demanded the three contested regions as a precondition for a ceasefire agreement. Armenia had no choice but to agree.

However, Armenia found it impossible to cede the aforementioned regions to Azerbaijan and expressed hope to reach an agreement through some kind of compromise. But if Azerbaijan, with the help of its allies [Bolsheviks and Kemalists], decides not to make any concessions and another armed conflict becomes inevitable, then it won't be Armenia's fault.

Armenia hopes that during these peace negotiations, our people will gain some peace, so we can organize the harvest and therefore the next military draft. In the meantime, our soldiers will have enough time to train to use the new weapons we received from England. Right now we need our soldiers to rest, arm themselves, and feel confident about the safety of their families.

These are the primary challenges we face today: 1) We are broke, 2) We don't have fuel, 3) We don't have means of transportation.

Your Excellency. The millions of dollars you've brought *[the diplomat is writing this letter to Alexander Khatisyan, who has just returned from a worldwide trip to collect cash and meet Armenian diaspora, basically 20th-century Himnadram]* ... the millions of dollars you've brought can help us overcome these unbearable conditions.

The government has decided to spare no means for defending our borders and rights. To this end, the government has announced new conscription throughout Armenia and coercive measures to strengthen the army. //

##Armenian-British military collaboration: 1918-1920

>Armenian-British military cooperation was on strong footing during the short life of the first Armenian Republic. 

>After independence, Armenia was an ally of Great Britain, a member of Entente. 

>This alliance is clear by the fact that Armenia continued to wage war against Turkey, which was among the most active opponents of Entente, and Turkish troops had suffered undisputed defeats and bypassed Armenia.

Georgia had claims over the Kars region, too. Population of Kars at the time: 123k Armenians, 103k Turks, 55k Kurds, 4k Georgians, ... Alexander Khatisyan visited Tbilisi, Georgia, to discuss the issue of Kars with General Walker, England’s supreme commander.

It ended with the border being drawn in the following way: 
 
>Ardahan Province’s northern part, above Ardahan city, the other side of the Poskov River, went to Georgia, and temporarily, the western part of Kars, from Merdenek westward, would stay under English command as a zone that directly shares a border with the state of Batumi. 

>the provinces of Kars and Kaghzvan, along with the Kars fort, as well as the city of Ardahan, were to be turned over to Armenia, which included the Alexdropol-Kars-Sarikamish-Karaurgan railroad. Oltisi Province, evidently, was to remain to the Turks.

England assigned Colonel Temperley to enforce the handover of territories to Armenians. English generals came to meet Armenian commander Dro and others to discuss the deployment of Armenian troops in Kars. There would be 1,200 Armenian and 3,000 English troops. Colonel Temperley was appointed as military governor, while Stepan Ghorghanyan was appointed civilian governor.

>it was a very big deal for Armenian forces to enter Kars. It was an occasion that created much enthusiasm among the people

The local Turkish governor [Shukra Pasha] refused to hand over power to the Armenian counterpart, so the English Colonel Temperley issued a warrant for his arrest. The guy was able to escape, however. Colonel Temperley summoned the rest of the Turkish militias and gave them 3 minutes to comply, which they did. 

The General of the Armenian army spent 6 weeks in London in 1919 to discuss military assistance. Great Britain’s foreign secretary Lord George N. Curzon continuously insisted on assisting Armenia. 

After the defeat of the White Army in Russia, Great Britain had doubts that Georgia and Azerbaijan could resist the Russian Red Army, but the foreign minister ""insisted in assisting the Armenian people, saying that Britain has a moral debt to pay the Armenian people.""

>Lord Curzon came forth with a special speech. After praising the bravery of Armenians, and insisting that they would be able to secure themselves if they are supplied with adequate weaponry, he went on to say that the suffering of the Armenians must be ameliorated, and promises by the warring nations towards the Armenians must be kept

Great Britain announced the preparation of assistance 7 days later.

**Prime Minister Lloyd George about Armenia:** It depends entirely on the Armenians themselves—whether they protect their independence. They must do so; they must begin to depend upon themselves. 

They are an exceptionally intelligent people. In fact, it is their intelligence that gets them into trouble sometimes, from all I hear. That is what is so obnoxious to the Turks. I am told that they could easily organise an army of about 40,000 men. 

If they ask for equipment we shall be very happy to assist in equipping their army. If they want the assistance of officers to train that army, I am perfectly certain there is no Allied country in Europe that would not be willing to assist in that respect. 

That is far and away the best thing for themselves. It would increase their self-respect. It would make them a manlier and more virile people. Instead of always casting themselves upon other countries and sending supplications and appeals, let them defend themselves. When they do so the Turk will have too much respect—not for them, but for himself—to attempt any more massacres in that quarter. //

Later, artificial obstacles were created by Great Britain's War Office. They decided to sell the weapons at a high price instead. Then they claimed issues with the delivery. Foreign minister Lord Curzon called it unacceptable and summoned meetings. 

They finally agreed to send 48 field guns, 400 machine guns, 25,000 rifles, 40,000 units of military outfits, 1077 first aid kits, various military hardware, telescopes, compasses, gun repair kits, canned food, etc. 

The War Office demanded a hefty fee, to which Armenia agreed. On top of it, Georgia demanded 27% of the shipment as a transfer fee. Avetis Aharonian, chairman of the parliament of Armenia, expressed gratitude for the weaponry. There were also discussions to send 40 military advisors, on top of those who had already beein Armenia for 2 years, and aircraft. 

The head of the Armenian army, during his multi-week trip to London, visited factories to study the production of bullets. No equipment was subsequently purchased because Armenia was broke. Later they were supposed to send something, but the War Office blocked it again, citing unrest in Armenia and the Armenian government's decision to hold negotiations with Bolshevik Russia. Winston Churchill was concerned that British weapons could fall into the hands of the Bolsheviks.

There were efforts to move England's unused aircraft from Egypt to Armenia but the War Office blocked it again, citing Armenia's financial constraints and lack of expertise to use the aircraft. The Foreign Office was able to convince the War Office to supply aircraft, however. Many aviation experts began visiting Armenia. Armenia purchased 2 English airplanes.

>The quantity of the supplied weapons was very large for the Armenian army, and the cost in today’s value would be about 80 million British pounds, which is quite a significant loan amount for a single year even by today’s standard.

##Azerbaijani forces kidnap 3 ethnic Armenian students who were crossing the Azeri checkpoint illegally installed in Lachin corridor 

The students are professional soccer players who supposedly burned down the Azerbaijani flag as a sign of protest earlier. Azerbaijani authorities plan to charge them with ""disrespecting"" Azerbaijan. The students will remain under arrest for 10 days before being deported to Armenia. They will not be allowed to return back to their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh anymore. A protest was organized in front of the Russian embassy in Armenia for allowing the Azeri regime to kidnap the students.

The World Court had earlier ordered Azerbaijan to end the illegal obstruction of the 2-way movement through the Lachin corridor. Azerbaijan has not complied. 

**GOVERNMENT OF ARMENIA:** These kidnappings once again give reason to believe that Azerbaijan is planning to subject the entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh to collective punishment. 

The entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh is deprived of all fundamental rights, food, medicine, gas, and electricity, while Azerbaijani snipers terrorize people, kidnap residents, and block the corridor to Armenia.

This demonstrates the true aspirations of the Azerbaijani leadership. They are avoiding dialogue with Nagorno-Karabakh at all costs and instead continue the policy of ethnic cleansing. //

##Commissioner for Human Rights at Council of Europe: Restore free movement along the Lachin Corridor and ensure the rapid and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance in Nagorno-Karabakh

**Dunja Mijatović:** Despite numerous calls by international stakeholders, the humanitarian and human rights situation in the area has further deteriorated due to the prolonged disruption in the movement of people and access to food supplies and urgent medical care.

The relevant stakeholders should immediately find a solution to avoid any further deterioration of the very dangerous situation.

I confirm my readiness to engage with all the relevant interlocutors and to travel to Nagorno-Karabakh to assist in overcoming the existing human rights challenges.

##Public International Law & Policy Group's report on Nagorno-Karabakh: External self-determination via remedial secession

>The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth the argument that the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh are entitled, at a minimum, to the right of internal self-determination and that the current negotiations should provide for the meaningful and effective protection of this right. 

>As such, Nagorno-Karabakh’s Soviet-era autonomous status should serve as a benchmark for discussions between Armenia and Azerbaijan concerning the future fate and status of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

The report analyzes the pre-1990 mistreatment of ethnic Armenians by Azerbaijani authorities:

>Prior to 1988, Azerbaijan's human rights record with respect to the
Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh was rather dismal. During the seven decades of the USSR's existence, the government of Soviet Azerbaijan conducted a systematic policy of repression and removal of Karabakh Armenians from their historic homeland. 

>During this time, the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh was reduced from ninety-five percent of the total population of the
region in 1926, to seventy-five percent of the population in 1976. 

>In the nearby Azerbaijani-administered enclave of Nakhichevan, the Armenian population was reduced from 40% of the population to zero. 

>Subsequent to the Karabakh movement for independence in 1988, the human rights violations against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh intensified, including “pogroms, deportations, and other atrocities.”

Conclusion:

>In the event that Azerbaijan refuses to accept that Nagorno-Karabakh’s
Soviet-era autonomous status be included on the agenda and serve as a benchmark for discussions between Armenia and Azerbaijan concerning the future fate and status of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, this is a clear signal of a continued rejection of that right for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, and this opens the door to the possibility of external self-determination via remedial secession

##Nagorno-Karabakh president changed his mind and refused to resign after learning that Gen. Samvel Babayan could become the next leader: journalist Tatul Hakobyan reveals details 

Context: It was claimed that Arayik Harutyunyan had promised to resign but broke the promise under unknown circumstances. Journalists Tatul Hakobyan and Petros Ghazaryan discuss the events.

**TATUL:** First of all, Russia's 14-point document [that outlines the subjugation of ethnic Armenians to Azerbaijani rule] is an authentic paper. Moscow passed it to Stepanakert through Yerevan. Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians are joking that they wished it was written by Azerbaijan so it would have more favorable terms. It's great that people maintain their sense of humor.

**PETROS:** Let's discuss the situation around the resignation of Nagorno-Karabakh president Harutyunyan.

**TATUL:** During the closed-door meeting, Harutyunyan complained about Russia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, and announced that he can no longer manage the crisis. He said he would resign but ended up not doing so. Here is what happened...

They were supposed to nominate a new candidate for the presidency. The parliament would then elect the candidate as the new president. 

That's when Harutyunyan saw a threat of a takeover by Samvel Babayan because Harutyunyan's ruling party members, who hold the majority in parliament, declared that they would not necessarily vote in favor of the candidate nominated by Bako Sahakyan, Robert Kocharyan, or Ruben Vardanyan [the former regime]. They said they would vote freely.

Despite my rocky relations with Samvel Babayan, I think he is the only party that at least has proposed plans. The others aren't doing anything. 

**PETROS:** What is the ruling party's and Harutyunyan's plan? They rejected the initial negotiations, then they accepted it, then they wanted the negotiations to take place not here but there, and then they changed their mind and agreed.

**TATUL:** I agree. But if you place yourself in Harutyunayan's shoes, he is under immense pressure. 

**PETROS:** Does the former regime's candidate have a plan?

**TATUL:** I haven't heard anything. Their idea so far is to force the government out so they can come to power ""to solve the problems"".

##S&P upgrades Armenia from 'B+' to 'BB-' on robust growth and improved fiscal position; outlook stable

Spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine conflict helped Armenia's economy to expand significantly by 12.6%. The growth is expected to slow but remain at 7.5% in 2023. Armenia's IT sector has expanded by 51%, partly thanks to the migration of skilled Russian workers.

The worsening economy in Russia, the end of the migration-related benefits, and possible clashes with Azerbaijan could harm the economic growth, but the recent increase in human and financial capital could strengthen Armenia's potential growth rate. 

The average annual real GDP growth rate will be 4% until 2026.

In a sense, what Azerbaijan had been trying to say to the world for the past eight months, Armenia accomplished in one week by dispelling the falsehoods of Lachin road being the ""only road to Karabakh"" and ""road of life.""

Well, this is what I think.

-Russia is a huge threat to Europe. It directly borders EU, and field the largest army in the entire continent.

- It currently invades Ukraine and commit warcrimes there. It also threatens to invade other countries, which many are in the EU. 

-They talk about reconquering the USSR borders.

-They are allied with China, which is a totalitarian dystopia and threatens many countries.

-They have nukes.

Meanwhile, Azerbaijan:

-Merely threatens Armenia, a small nation in Caucassus which has no significance to Europe in terms of military, diplomacy and economy. And let's not forget that Armenia is in a military alliance with Russia.

-Azerbaijan enjoys good relations with all of its neighbors except Iran and Armenia.

-Carries gas to Europe, which reduces the Russian hegemony on Europe's gas, which is always welcome.

-Supports Ukraine in many ways.

-Their claims are accepted by people, which means:

a)They are simply right in pursuing their cause, so no one wants to side with Armenia

b)They excel at propaganda when compared to Armenia, which is huge given that there are many armenians living in important countries and actually affect their politics.

So yeah, that's pretty much it. Please feel free to express your opinions. I would love to hear your side on this.",1
9/20/2023,"EU warns Azerbaijan not to cause exodus of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh // France summons UN Security Council // Armenia-Russia relations: Medvedev, Margo, Grigoryan // Interview: Aram Sargsyan & others // Yerevan elections: Marutyan's team agrees","##Azerbaijan attacks Nagorno-Karabakh: 16 villages depopulated; civilians & children murdered; hundreds are encircled; residential districts under attack

Air sirens were activated in Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday after Azerbaijan launched a massive air and land assault on the republic after months of preparing the ground with false accusations of ""provocations by Armenians"". It's a tactic commonly used by Azerbaijan ahead of every aggression to mislead the international community.

The targets were civilian structures in settlements and Nagorno-Karabakh's local Defense Army's positions along the line of contact. Drones, artillery, and missile systems were/are being used. The Republic of Armenia withdrew its army from Nagorno-Karabakh shortly after the 2020 war. With this attack, Azerbaijan is attempting to subjugate the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh by disarming their local defense forces. 

##... casualties as of late evening

27 dead (1 child, 2 civilians)

200 wounded (>12 children, dozens of civilians)

Azerbaijan said it has captured 60 positions along the line of contact.

##... before the aggression

Azerbaijan claimed they had informed Russia ahead of the attack. Russia said they were informed only minutes before the launch. They requested Azerbaijan to ensure the safety of Russian peacekeepers. They are in talks with Azerbaijan about the situation.

Russia said its peacekeepers will not take action against Azerbaijan's aggression unless Azerbaijan targets them first.

##... the goal is to force ethnic Armenians to leave their homeland 

**MFA of ARMENIA:** Guided by a sense of impunity, Azerbaijan openly took responsibility for the aggression. We strongly condemn Azerbaijan's aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh and the mass atrocity crimes which is the continuation of the 2020 war. 

We have repeatedly warned that the continuous aggressive actions of Azerbaijan, the warmongering rhetoric, and the reprehensible propaganda of calling the population of Nagorno-Karabakh ""terrorists"" pursues one goal: to subject the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to ethnic cleansing through the use of force and deprive them from the right to live freely and in dignity in their own homeland.

We call on international partners, members of the UN Security Council, and the Russian peacekeeping contingent to undertake clear and unequivocal steps to put an end to Azerbaijan's aggression. //

**PM PASHINYAN:** Azerbaijan's aggression began with an artillery attack, followed by a ground invasion of border positions and some villages. The goal is to subject the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to ethnic cleansing. Russian peacekeepers must take action. Secondly, the UN Security Council must take action. 

If Azerbaijan claims this is an ""anti-terrorist"" operation not targeting civilians, then why did they announce the opening of a humanitarian corridor for the population of Nagorno-Karabakh to leave the region? If their intention was not to target civilian settlements, they should have urged civilians to take shelter instead of leaving the region. *[Azerbaijan said they will allow ethnic Armenians to exit the republic via Lachin corridor.]*

Armenia never gave Azerbaijan a mandate to commit ethnic cleansings in Nagorno-Karabakh. The rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh must be guaranteed.

Any attempts to involve the Republic of Armenia in a conflict is unacceptable. There are internal and external forces who want to drag Armenia into a large-scale conflict to endanger Armenia's sovereignty. Armenia will not take any drastic steps at this time. Stay vigilant and wait for official updates. //

##... the future presence of Russia in the region will depend on their peacekeepers' response to Azerbaijani aggression: analyst Sergey Melkonyan

**MELKONYAN:** The choice is simple: either Russian peacekeepers guarantee the fulfillment of the Nov. 9 agreement and subdue the aggressor, or the war in the zone of responsibility of peacekeepers will take place under their passive observation. In that case, it will no longer be necessary to talk about Russia's role as an exclusive security provider.

##... Russia's response

Russia requested ""both sides"" to establish a ceasefire. A ranking member of Armenia's ruling party expressed disappointment over Russia's bothsidesism rhetoric.

Lately, Russia has been accusing the Armenian side [unclear if referring to Yerevan or Stepanakert] of not fulfilling certain ""obligations"". The Armenian government wants Russia to clarify what this ""obligation"" is. Armenia says it has met all the Nov. 9 obligations. 

**Analysis:** Azerbaijan wants a 'corridor' through Armenia that will be outside of Armenian control. Armenia says it's prepared to provide a transportation route to Azerbaijani traffic, monitored by Armenian and Russian customs agents jointly to ensure the safety of Azerbaijani travelers. Azerbaijan has rejected the offer; they want only Russian or Azerbaijani agents to monitor it.

Russia has not publicly clarified what exactly it wants from Armenia, and whether it expects a ""corridor"" passing through Armenia. Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan's media outlet had earlier accused Russia of covertly working with Azerbaijan to establish a Russian-controlled sovereign corridor passing through Armenia. This would be against the Nov. 9 agreement.

Azerbaijan and Russia have kept the population of Nagorno-Karabakh under blockade since December 2022 after the Armenian government's refusal to grant the ""corridor"" to Azerbaijan. //

##... Armenian PM Pashinyan's media outlet claims Russia gave Nagorno-Karabakh's Defense Army's equipment locations to Azerbaijan

**ArmTimes:** According to sources, the Russian side provided Azerbaijan with the coordinates of equipment and structures in Nagorno-Karabakh before moving away from the mentioned positions to allow Azerbaijan to launch the attack.

##... Russia's ex-president Dmitri Medvedev: Can you guess what's awaiting Pashinyan?

Dmitri Medvedev said that Pashinyan will be removed from power for strengthening Armenia's relations with the West.

**KAREN SARGSYAN, analyst:** I normally wouldn't take Medvedev seriously because he is known for making provocative statements, including about nuclear strikes and the Ukraine war. But it's entirely possible that he has been briefed on certain activities that are being planned in Armenia. 

We knew that Kremlin didn't want Pashinyan in power but this is the first time a high-ranking official is openly stating it. I'm not surprised. By formally remaining part of the Russian-led block, we are depriving ourselves of the ability to establish closer cooperation with the West. 
The darkest time is always just before sunrise. We are closer than ever to Kosovo's scenario. Nagorno-Karabakh must fight for dignified self-governance or statehood. //

The pro-Russian opposition forces gathered in front of the government building with demands for Pashinyan's removal. They clashed with the police in an attempt to break into the building. Over 30 police officers and protesters were injured. 

Other protesters gathered in front of the Russian embassy to complain about Russia's inaction and for allowing Azerbaijan to carry out ethnic cleansing. They encircled the embassy. Analyst Karen Sargsyan said the goal was to entrap and starve out the Russian ambassador. Russia's MFA sent a note to Armenia requesting the blockade to be lifted.

##... Russian state propagandist Margarita Simonyan: Russia will do fine without Armenia 

**SIMONYAN:** Russia will survive without Armenia, but Armenia without Russia - of course not. Kim Kardashian and NATO won't help you. Only Russia can help Armenia. //

##... interview with Armenia's National Security Council chief Armen Grigoryan || Russia is not a reliable partner

**GRIGORYAN:** As we have repeatedly warned, Azerbaijan is attempting to carry out an ethnic cleansing and genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**REPORTER:** Is the target only Nagorno-Karabakh?

**GRIGORYAN:** Events in Nagorno-Karabakh have a direct impact on the internal stability of Armenia. Just as on November 9, 2020, we see certain forces with the direct support of external forces [Russian] are targeting the government. 

**REPORTER:** Why hasn't the government prosecuted those who have committed violence and called for a coup in Armenia over the past 3 years? Isn't your lax policy at fault? Why is the state allowing this? 

**GRIGORYAN:** There are objective and subjective reasons for them not being behind bars. These are individuals who are being used by foreign states. I think everyone in Armenia understands this now. The public has already judged them by ignoring their calls.  

**REPORTER:** They blame you for the current situation, for harming the relations with Russia. 

**GRIGORYAN:** If they think Russia bases its strategic goals on individual level then we cannot take Russia seriously. As for the ongoing propaganda campaign to blame Armenia for the situation, it should be noted that Azerbaijan is the genocidal aggressor here.

**REPORTER:** The opposition blames you for the cooperation between Russia and Azerbaijan.

**GRIGORYAN:** Russia has been cooperating with Azerbaijan for a long time now. They started selling weapons worth $5 billion to Azerbaijan a decade ago. Armenia did not make any changes to its foreign policy vector after we came to power in 2018, at least not until 2022.

Russia has very clear obligations under the Nov. 9, 2020, Statement to protect Nagorno-Karabakh. What is their issue with the Armenian government in this context? Do they mean there is something more important than Vladimir Putin's signature under that document? Is it worth nothing? 

Russia has not been fulfilling its obligation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan has launched a large-scale attack under the inaction of Russian peacekeepers.  

Russia claims it learned about the attack just minutes before the launch. In reality, we've been informing them and the world at least since September 4th about Azerbaijan's pending aggression. Pashinyan sent a letter to Putin, describing the entire situation. 

**REPORTER:** The pro-Russian opposition claims since you're conducting NATO exercises in Armenia, sending the First Lady to Kyiv, ratifying the Rome Statute, all of these are interpreted as hostile steps by Russia so they are choosing not to help.

**GRIGORYAN:** None of the steps taken by Armenia that you've just listed existed before December 2021, yet Russia displayed inaction after Azerbaijan's invasion of Sotk/Khoznavar direction in May and November. Facts show that Russia is not fulfilling its obligations. Even the Prague meeting hadn't taken place yet. 

Instead, Russia adopted Azerbaijan's arguments claiming that the reason is the lack of delimited AM-AZ borders. In reality, we do have fixed borders under the Alma-Ata agreement. Russia could have protected those borders if it wanted to. They'd rather blame Armenia endlessly. Something is wrong with our skin and eye color, we may find out one day. 

**REPORTER:** They say you came with anti-Russian policies in 2018.

**GRIGORYAN:** We entered Syria under the Russian flag. We voted in support of Russia in every institution. We remained in CSTO and EAEU. Our vector didn't change. But in the end, all we got was a Nagorno-Karabakh war in 2020 and the invasion of Armenia in 2021-2022. None of this has to do with the Prague meeting. Real allies help instead of finding excuses.

**REPORTER:** Should Armenia intervene in the ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh? 

**GRIGORYAN:** The army of the Republic of Armenia continues to defend only the Republic of Armenia. As for the Nagorno-Karabakh situation, the international community, and first and foremost Russia, must take steps. Russian peacekeepers have many obligations other than providing medical aid. Their primary role is to protect the safety of the civilians. Vladimir Putin's signature is on it. 

**REPORTER:** Dmitri Medvedev threatened to destroy the Armenian government. How do you plan on cooperating with Russia after that statement? 

**GRIGORYAN:** It's something that Russia should think about. They should clarify that policy because it is against the Republic of Armenia in general. There is a war and they are making such statements? I think the Armenian public will show an adequate response to that.

If Russia wants to remain in this region, they must take steps to prevent the ethnic cleansing and genocide. If they don't, that means they have chosen to leave the region. // *[sounds like an ultimatum]*

##... calls are made to nationalize Russian companies' assets in Armenia 

**Ioannesian, Informed Citizens NGO:** Armenia gave Russia a monopoly for gas, all the important economic hubs, the nuclear plant, railways, membership to CSTO and EAEU, all this in exchange for security guarantees. 

It's obvious now that Russia has joined our enemy. Now they are trying to organize a coup in Armenia.

Immediately nationalize Gazprom-Armenia, take over the control of railways and the nuclear plant, remove the 102nd Russian military base from Armenia and their border guards, and shut down the broadcasting of Russian state media in Armenia. //

##... major Russian opposition media outlets and figures took a more pro-Armenian stance 

Putin critic Vladimir Milov, a former Russian government member, believes ethnic Armenians cannot be ruled by Azerbaijan because the latter is a dictatorship that cannot guarantee the physical safety of Armenians, especially considering the history of massacres of Armenians in various settlements of Azerbaijan. He joined the EU and condemned the aggression. Milov said he had warned Armenia not to trust Putin with Armenia's security. *""Putin spat on Armenia.""*

##... interview with ex-PM Aram Sargsyan

**SARGSYAN:** The world has seen conflicts like this. There was a similar situation in Kosovo. Azerbaijan has adopted Serbia's policies. The UN decided to deploy peacekeepers after Serbs invaded territories and took hostages. The Hague ruled it a genocide, prompting the world to recognize Kosovo's independence. 

The difference with Nagorno-Karabakh is that while the leaders of Kosovo had been working with the West for a year, the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh chose to cling to Russia and dismissed the ""British tanks that cannot climb our mountains"". I've warned on numerous occasions that the only way to save Nagorno-Karabakh is by deploying international peacekeepers. 

My brothers, you followed Russia and removed President Arayik Harutyunyan from power in Nagorno-Karabakh, replacing him with some security agency agent. And what is the result? Do you want the same in Armenia now?

**REPORTER:** Explain the connection with Arayik's removal.

**SARGSYAN:** During his press conference Arayik urged the world and Russia to open the Lachin corridor within 15 days. I've been in touch with Arayik and I'll open a secret now *[here we go again]*: I listened to his stance and informed him that I'll convey his message to the U.S. ambassador in Armenia. Arayik's stance was that if within 15 days the world didn't do everything possible to open the Lachin corridor, a mass starvation would begin, prompting the Nagorno-Karabakh government to request a safe corridor to evacuate the entire 120,000 population out of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

If Arayik was in power right now, he would have made that request, [prompting a strong response from the West and more pressure]. Today's president will not do this because that would be against Russian interests. Russia needs 5,000 ethnic Armenians with Azerbaijani passports to remain in Nagorno-Karabakh so they can keep their troops in this region.

**REPORTER:** Why shouldn't Armenia become part of Russia, like Tatarstan? We are surrounded by enemies. Maybe that's the best option. 

**SARGSYAN:** Independence is a supreme value. I would have arrested you for even suggesting that if I were the authority. 

**REPORTER:** I'm just asking. 

**SARGSYAN:** Hah. Still unacceptable. That would be the end of Armenia. The path to our survival is to break free of Russia. Declare right now that Armenia is choosing the U.S. nuclear technology for its next reactor. The U.S. first made an offer to install modular reactors in Armenia 3 years ago. You could diversify the reactors' geographical locations for security and power grid management purposes. They are also very seismically resilient due to their capsular design.  

The UN Security Council session is on Thursday. The government of Nagorno-Karabakh must send them a letter stating that Russian peacekeepers aren't fulfilling their duties, and make the following demand: either send international peacekeepers or ensure a safe exodus of ethnic Armenians out of Nagorno-Karabakh. //

##... EU's response to Azerbaijan's aggression

The EU requested Azerbaijan to cease the attack and added: *""This military escalation should not be used as a pretext to force the exodus of the local population.""*

**EU:** We condemn the military escalation along the Line of Contact & in other locations in Karabakh.  We call for an immediate cessation of hostilities & for Azerbaijan to stop military activities. //

##... Norway's response:

>Continued use of Azerbaijani military power may force the Armenian population to flee the region and create a humanitarian catastrophe. Such a tragedy must be avoided at all costs.

##... France's response

France condemned Azerbaijan and requested a UN Security Council session on September 21. ""France places the exclusive responsibility for the fate of the people of Nagorno Karabakh on Azerbaijan.""

France is in touch with the U.S. and EU. A phone call was held between Pashinyan and Macron.

##... U.S. response

Pashinyan spoke with Anthony Blinken. They both emphasized the need to use international mechanisms for de-escalation.

**BLINKEN:** The U.S. calls on Azerbaijan to cease these military actions immediately. These actions are worsening an already dire humanitarian situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and undermine prospects for peace.  As we have previously made clear to Azerbaijan, the use of force to resolve disputes is unacceptable and runs counter to efforts to create conditions for a just and dignified peace in the region.  We call for an immediate end to hostilities and for respectful dialogue between Baku and representatives of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh.


##... UK's response 

**UK:** The return of military conflict is devastating for the local population. Azerbaijan should cease military action. U.K. working hard to urge dialogue. 

##... Germany accuses Azerbaijan of breaking a promise 

**FM of Germany, Baerbock:** Over the past few weeks, we've spoken with the Azerbaijani side and received promises for the safe passage of humanitarian convoys, and that there won't be violence. We see that this promise was broken.

**PM Scholz:** Baku must immediately stop the attacks and return to diplomacy to reach a peaceful solution.

##... response by Freedom House:

Any attempt to forcibly change the region's demographics is illegal and unacceptable. We strongly condemn the Azerbaijani government’s violent attacks in Nagorno-Karabakh, heightening the risk of ethnic cleansing against the region’s Armenian population.


##... POLITICO: Azerbaijan launches attack in Nagorno-Karabakh, announces ‘evacuation’ of Armenian population

[article](https://www.politico.eu/article/azerbaijan-launch-anti-terror-operation-nagorno-karabakh-armenia/)

##... ethnic Armenian civilians in a Nagorno-Karabakh village find themselves encircled by Azerbaijani troops 

Village Yeghtsahogh (Եղցահող) with a population of 150 cannot evacuate residents because they have been encircled. Azerbaijani army targeted the local school.

The village is just north of Mets Shen, another village that was targeted by Azerbaijan shortly after the 2020 war. 

##... Azerbaijani aggression has forced ethnic Armenians of 16 Nagorno-Karabakh villages to leave their homes 

Some of the villages are Khramort, Khnapat, Sarnaghbyur, Nakhijevanik, Machkalashen, and Chankatagh. They are located along the Agdam-Stepanakert road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh's Ivanyan to Azerbaijan's Agdam.

Overall, 7,000 people had to be evacuated out of 16 settlements across Nagorno-Karabakh.

##... calls for negotiations

The Nagorno-Karabakh government urged Azerbaijan to cease hostilities as soon as possible and engage in negotiations. Azerbaijan later stated they are willing to hold talks in the Azerbaijani settlement of Yevlakh under the condition that Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians would dissolve all branches of the local government. No ceasefire has been established as of 2 a.m.

##... members of the European Parliament urged the European Council to discuss sanctions against Azerbaijan

**MEPs:** We condemn in the strongest terms this pre-planned and unjustified Azerbaijani attack on Nagorno-Karabakh. In the absence of an immediate halt to the attack, we call on the EU Council to fundamentally review relations with Azerbaijan and consider imposing sanctions against the responsible Azerbaijani authorities.

##electoral commission is conducting mandatory recount after a tight race in Yerevan municipal elections 

The process will be monitored by the political parties, NGOs, and the press. It will be recorded. A difference of as little as 100 votes could change the number of Council seats allocated to each party, said Informed Citizens NGO yesterday.

The former regime has, without evidence, accused the ruling party of attempting to ""rig"" the vote. The ruling party denied the accusation and said they did not initiate this recount. This recount is required under the law. Three random polling stations will be selected in each precinct for the recount.

##analyst Karen Sargsyan about Yerevan elections

**KAREN:** Tigran Avinyan was perhaps the worst candidate the ruling party could have nominated. He was a pandemic- and war-era figure with heavy baggage. Even many officials within QP did not want his candidacy. The ruling party's mistake was treating Yerevan like the rest of the country. 

Still, I don't think this election indicates the end of Pashinyan. If the turnout was >50% with each party winning similar shares, then perhaps you could argue that.

What's clear after this election is that the former regime has peaked. They only got like 25,000 votes out of 825,000. That's about the size of their biggest crowd during the 2021-2022 protests. 

The state of media health is laughable. People are hooked on Russian-language Telegram channels. The public is consuming Russian propaganda en masse yet even under these conditions they could only get 25,000 votes. //

##Hayk Marutyan's team supports the idea of working with the former regime to remove Pashinyan from power

Context in [yesterday's election results coverage](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16m6bex/the_clown_show_begins/).

Marutyan's ranking party member Isabella Abgaryan was asked to comment on a possible coalition with the former regime and Dog, after Marutyan left the door open in his Monday speech. 

Marutyan's team does not want to sign an official coalition but wants the former regime and Dog to help Marutyan become the mayor. ""We all have the same goal,"" said Abgaryan. The goal is to prevent ""evil"" Tigran Avinyan from becoming the mayor. 

**QUESTION:** How would this setup work, though? If the ex-regime and Dog vote for Marutyan without a formal coalition and join the QP as opposition.

**ABGARYAN:** It will be an interesting situation. The second largest party will rule. The largest party will become an opposition. No worries though, because the Council only makes decisions on non-political issues. They are about administrative decisions. Obviously, Marutyan and our team will have to ensure that other parties support his proposed plans. 

We must never forget that we only have an advantage of a single seat, however. That's dangerous. I've never seen a Council session where every member is present for a vote. People miss a vote because they get sick, they are on a trip etc. Avinyan would have a similar problem if he were in our place. How are you supposed to pass the municipal budget like this? Sadly, I predict a governing crisis. This was not the ideal outcome.

**QUESTION:** In exchange for votes, the former regime wants Marutyan to help remove Pashinyan from power. Do you support this?

**ABGARYAN:** If Marutyan becomes the mayor of Yerevan, obviously he will be interested in changing the central government in Armenia and remove Pashinyan who is unfriendly to him.

##Azerbaijan is an unreliable partner, Europe should stop buying its natural gas: head of European Parliament Roberta Metsola

[article,](https://arka.am/en/news/politics/head_of_european_parliament_calls_baku_an_unreliable_partner_saying_europe_should_stop_buying_its_na/)



##Azerbaijan's plan to double gas exports to EU at risk as talks stall: Bloomberg 

>Azerbaijan may not be able to deliver on ambitions to double natural gas exports to Europe by 2027, having failed to secure long-term sales deals it needs before investing billions of dollars to boost production, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

AZ-EU talks began after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the EU's energy crisis has since eased and they aren't as desperate anymore. 

>time may have run out for Azerbaijan to lock in the long-term contracts it needs to underpin investments in infrastructure.

Unlike pipeline transfers, liquified natural gas (LNG) does not require decades-long contracts and its infrastructure is flexible. The EU will buy LNG from the U.S. and Qatar.

>the market is expected to see a buildup of an oversupply in global LNG markets from 2027 and onwards

Romania said it will not sign a long-term contract. Germany has not yet held any serious talks with Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijani gas industry official says they might not be able to meet the target of supplying the additional 10 bcm to Europa by 2027. 

>Azerbaijan’s recent seizure of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which led about 100,000 Armenians to flee to Armenia amid fears of ethnic cleansing, could weigh on any decisions European buyers make. 

An American analyst believes Azerbaijan ""has shot itself in the foot"" with the invasion, and that Azeri gas will remain in Azerbaijan unless Turkey wants to buy more.

##interview with Nagorno-Karabakh opposition leader Samvel Babayan 

Read Babayan's [September 26](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16t0inm/samvel_babayan_azerbaijan_had_agreed_to_autonomy/) interview for context. He revealed details from the not-so-secret negotiations he was holding with Azerbaijan with the permission of President Arayik, against the wishes of the former regime that would later oust Arayik. Babayan was the first high-profile Nagorno-Karabakh official who crossed into Armenia without getting arrested. He said the Azerbaijan agents weren't thoroughly checking the passports during the mass exodus. The opposition parties in Armenia accused Babayan of complicating the departure of other Nagorno-Karabakh officials, citing more thorough identification procedures at the checkpoint a day after Babayan's crossing.

**REPORTER:** [Brings up Babayan's safe passage through the checkpoint]

**BABAYAN:** You can end the conspiracy theories by requesting Azerbaijan to share the video footage from the checkpoint to see how exactly I crossed it. I drove there, greeted the Azeri agents, got scanned, and entered Armenia. My impression is that the agents did not recognize me and weren't expecting me to be there. Over 20 generals crossed the same way as I did.

**REPORTER:** There are no Armenians left in Nagorno-Karabakh, yet we don't see Azeris [civilians] in Nagorno-Karabakh, either. They have invaded everything, so what are they waiting for? 

**BABAYAN:** Azerbaijan will refrain from making any moves for 2 months to ""allow the Nagorno-Karabakh population to return"", according to them. The question is, if Armenians return, will they be forced to ""reintegrate"", or will we receive some kind of autonomous status? The latter was my proposal. There were negotiations. The documents have been handed over to authorities as part of a general investigation. You will eventually see them.

But we should focus on the situation today. We must continue these negotiations with Azerbaijan to allow Armenians to have an autonomous republic within the NKAO borders. Without this, it would be pointless to try to return. People will regret it if they return without a status. 

It is true that Azerbaijan has assigned a commandant to oversee the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Their goal is to convince a few thousand Armenians to return so they'll avoid being accused of ethnic cleansing. Today there are no more than 33 Armenians left. 

There are also efforts in Armenia to return some refugees to Nagorno-Karabakh. I don't know who these people are, whether they are Russian agents or someone else, but they are attempting to convince some of the refugees to return by promising that Russian peacekeepers will remain in the region for many years and ""it will be safe"".

**REPORTER:** One must be a kamikaze to agree to return under these conditions.

**BABAYAN:** You can always find people who are easily convinced, who are perhaps elderly and get tired easily and want to return to old life. I advise them to be careful.

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan could have easily repopulated the invaded areas by bussing in thousands of people. Why haven't they done so yet?  

**BABAYAN:** There is international pressure to create conditions to allow Armenians to return. Aliyev's adviser has revealed that Azerbaijan will refrain from any actions in Nagorno-Karabakh over the next 2 months because they want Armenians to return. Azerbaijan will try to use these 2 months to strengthen its diplomatic positions.

**REPORTER:** What is your vision for returning the refugees to their homes?

**BABAYAN:** The same thing that I was negotiating with Azerbaijan. We were in the midst of negotiations [when the invasion took place]. The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army has been dissolved so that issue is no longer on the table. We should continue to negotiate around the other issues. 

**REPORTER:** Will the Nagorno-Karabakh population trust you?

**BABAYAN:** The real question is, will the negotiation lead to the return of the population? People want someone to successfully negotiate for their safe return. We are holding talks with various circles from Nagorno-Karabakh regarding our negotiations with Azerbaijan so that no one will claim it's an obscure process, but I will not ask for anyone's ""permission"" to hold these negotiations. I can do so as the #2 political party of Nagorno-Karabakh.

**REPORTER:** It's not clear anymore who the leader of Nagorno-Karabakh is after Shahramanyan's decree to dissolve the state.

**BABAYAN:** He did not have the legal right to sign that document. He can't annul a referendum by a stroke of a pen.

**REPORTER:** How were President Shahramanyan and the 22 MPs who voted for him able to safely leave Nagorno-Karabakh, after the arrest of others? Did he sign the decree in exchange for saving his own skin? 

**BABAYAN:** The decree was the ransom payment. I'm cooperating with investigators in Armenia by sharing my knowledge. The other leaders should be invited to testify. Shahramanyan signed a ceasefire agreement that claimed the army of the Republic of Armenia was in Nagorno-Karabakh, which isn't true. Armenian authorities must investigate this.

The regime in Nagorno-Karabakh has long over-relied on ""phone calls from Moscow"" to solve the problems. This is why we've lost our country. I've been warning my fellow Karabakhis since 2016 that they will become refugees soon because of the actions of the thieves in charge. 

**REPORTER:** There are reports that the 3 ex-presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh were arrested by Azerbaijan in the military base belonging to Russian peacekeepers in Ivanyan. They hoped until the end to reach Armenia safely. Why did they end up getting arrested?

**BABAYAN:** According to the information I have, they weren't arrested at the Russian military base in Ivanyan. One of them was arrested in Stepanakert's wine factory [ehh?], and the others on the road. Yes, they had received promises [by Russian peacekeepers] about being safely evacuated. But they should have known better that it wouldn't work. The wife of Volkov [the head of Russian peacekeepers] was searched by Azeris every time the Russian helicopter would land in Nagorno-Karabakh. The ex-leaders should have realized that [Russians couldn't help them reach Armenia]. Why would Russia take a risk if you are disposable for them, you are one of their many agents.

**REPORTER:** Armenia sent tens of millions of dollars to support Nagorno-Karabakh residents under the blockade. The private sector was destroyed but the public workers continued to receive salaries with the help of Armenia's subsidies. People had money but didn't have a place where they could spend it. A lot of money was sent to Nagorno-Karabakh over the past few years. Where did it all go?

**BABAYAN:** Nagorno-Karabakh (pop. 120,000) had a public sector with a whopping 25,000 employees. Plus the army and territorial defense forces. I have long accused Pashinyan of enabling the regime in Stepanakert by showering them with cash. He gave drugs to an addict. The greedy regime in Stepanakert ended up causing the situation we are in today. You and I should not speculate where the money went to. Let the authorities investigate. But yes, the schemes worked until the last day.

I've been in touch with mayors of villages and towns. I have advised Pashinyan on how to handle the refugee influx, how to help people integrate, to prevent them from becoming diasporans. We made that mistake with the Armenians who escaped Sumgayit and Baku. Can't do that again.

##interview with analyst Karen Sargsyan || Banning Russian TV channels || Russia-Armenia relations || Geopolitics

**REPORTER:** [Ruling party members] recently mentioned the possibility of prohibiting the broadcasting of Russian state media in Armenia [for spreading propaganda against Armenia's sovereignty]. As it turns out, Armenian households have access to more Russian television channels than Armenian, in our own broadcasting multiplex. Moreover, Russian channels are the only foreign ones. We have fewer Armenian channels, zero English-language channels, and a large number of Russian channels. What is the effect on Armenia and our society?

**KAREN:** That's because we have a cowardly government that allows this to continue. Moreover, the H1 public network never invites Ukrainian officials for an interview, but there is no shortage of Russian officials. The network is run by a pro-Russian sect. 

One of the members of the sect is the director of No. 36 school, who recently summoned the teachers and told them ""We must collectively go lick Russian boots because we wouldn't exist without them."" That's a copy of Margarita Simonyan's social media posts. This is a clinical case that warrants a medical examination.

Authorities say they can't shut down Russian channels because they can't touch the commercial sector. That's just an excuse, there are easy ways to restrict the channels: Require Armenian ISPs to pay ֏700M per week per subscriber for broadcasting a Russian channel.

But that wouldn't be enough. They must summon the heads of every government office and give them 3 hours to block internet access to IP addresses belonging to Russian tech giants like mail ru, Yandex, Rambler, and Vkontakte. Block them all. There are criminal idiots in the government who email top-secret documents to each other through mail ru.

They met Zelenskty 1.5 years late, they ratified the Rome Statute 9 months late, so are they going to delay the banning of Russian channels by another year now? Why?

No more than 20% of our population uses the free-to-air public multiplex to watch Russian channels. Everyone else has internet [cable]. That 20%, most of whom are low-income residents in rural areas, don't watch Russian-language channels that much. So the main problem that spreads Russian propaganda isn't the free-to-air, it's the cable. When you buy a package with 100+ channels it comes with Russian channels by default. You have 14 channels that broadcast Russian soap operas, lots of Russian cartoon networks with Russian ads, etc.. This is the domain that pushes the Kremlin propaganda. Thankfully, the authorities have found the courage to at least bring this issue to the surface. 

**REPORTER:** Why are the Russian channels dangerous?

**KAREN:** When the first wave of Russian relocants moved to Armenia after the launch of the Ukraine war, some of them subscribed to cable channels and told me that there is more Kremlin propaganda in Armenia than in Russia. They were shocked. This is also a bad look in front of Europe. To describe the current state of our media, it's like a father feeding bread to his kid while both of them sit in a pile of shit in a barn.

**REPORTER:** Russian channels have become anti-Armenian.

**KAREN:** Their Telegram, too. Ideally, we'd have more Armenian-language content so they would push the Russian channels out, but in the short term, banning is the only option.

Why do we even have a school named after [Russian poet] Pushkin? Shut it down and transfer Pushkin's statue straight to a landfill. What has Pushkin done for Armenia? The same about Chekhov. 
We have an Armenian-Russian Slavonic University. Remove ""Russian"". Make it a general university associated with Slavic countries. Invite Poles and Slovaks to co-manage it.

I graduated from a school that was later named after [Soviet physisit] Sakharov after his death. It was very well funded by the Soviet regime back in my days. It was considered as one of the best in Armenia. The Soviet regime always made sure to properly fund Russian schools in Armenia. This was a known thing. They even built an underground passage near the Chekhov school. How many Armenian schools can you name on Baghramyan Avenue [prestigious area]? Russian schools were considered elite. Bolsheviks were taking their kids to Russian schools.   

**REPORTER:** About the quality of teachers and schools today...

**KAREN:** Awful. Sadly, we must rebuild our educational system from the ground up. Three mandatory languages: Armenian, English, and French. It must be based on a Western model: Swiss, Finnish, or British. 

I'm sure someone will lecture me on how great the Soviet schools were for math and physics. The reality is that the students and their parents of these elite phys-math schools could not have been smart because they believed in nonsense. The population of the USSR was hooked on Anatoly Kashpirovsky's psychic bullshit. People would place a bucket of water in front of their TV and tune in to Kashpirovsky's psychic session so the water would receive ""energy"". A person who is supposedly good at physics would never do or believe anything like this. The so-called ""good at physics"" was on surface-level only, or did not exist at all. You are not good at physics if you place a bottle of water in front of the TV and expect some monkey from Moscow's Ostankino Tower to remotely send energy to it. You are just an ordinary moron. Have you ever seen a homeless person on the streets who graduated from Harvard? You haven't, because in a normal society, you never fall below a certain level if you graduate from, let's say, a college or a university. There is a minimum threshold. But in ex-USSR republics, you can find many hobos with good diplomas. 

**REPORTER:** About the AM-AZ border delimitation and trade routes.

**KAREN:** Azerbaijan and Russia don't want Turkey to lift the blockade on Armenia. We shouldn't give Azerbaijan any routes to Nakhijevan until the AM-AZ border delimitation is over. Or, we could give them a route via Ijevan, whichever brings the most benefits to us. 

The Armenian government wants to use 1975 Soviet maps to demarcate the AM-AZ borders. The problem is that these maps were created with the use of highly inaccurate geolocation technologies. If you take that map and stand on a location mentioned on that map, your GPS could show that you're 400 meters off. These maps were created with the use of Baltika-42 or Kronshtadt-42 systems that are inaccurate on high altitudes. It was calibrated for use at a Baltic Sea level, or the Gulf of Finland. It's highly inaccurate. 

There is no shortage of degenerates in our military who want to use that. Even Russia has given up on that tech and they don't trust their own maps drawn with that technology. Arshak Karapetyan, the idiot who served as the defense minister for 6 months before being fired by Pashinyan, who is now releasing pro-Russian videos from Moscow, is the one who convinced Pashinyan to use the inaccurate 1975 maps. Have they actually *seen* the 1975 maps? Why not maps from earlier years?

**REPORTER:** Today, everyone and their uncle are discussing these maps, the 29,800 km^2, and the enclaves. Are the enclaves in or out? This is what the population is focused on today.

**KAREN:** People should focus on washing their hands before leaving the toilet instead of enclaves. People aren't paying attention to their children's grades and do not help them with homework because parents themselves have forgotten 4th-grade math. That's what they should do, not discuss enclaves. Can people even tell the difference between an enclave and an exclave? Why do they care? 

**REPORTER:** Why is everyone focused on enclaves?

**KAREN:** Because the degenerates called ""opposition parties"", and several degenerate government members, want to divert the attention from real issues that impact the population, such as the economy, currency exchange, education, etc. These are the things that have an actual impact on the ordinary Armenians, not the ""enclaves"". 

Armenia will not have peace for as long as Russia exists in its current form. The first thing an Armenian must do in the morning is to read two prayers: one for Zelensky and one for Ukraine to win the war *as soon as possible*. Pashinyan can speak about an era of peace and sign 10 peace agreements every day, but none of it will be worth anything as long as Aliyev has the backing of Putin.

##Armenian and German scientists have been busy collecting data from Lake Sevan over the past few years 

Armenian scientists make regular visits to Germany to study European methods. The AM-DE joint research group has collected data from Sevan over the past 3 years. They have concluded the project. The collected data has allowed them to create various models. 

Lake Sevan has lost a significant portion of its ""cold"" layer due to the gradual decrease in water levels throughout the decades. One of the models allows scientists to predict what would happen if the water levels were to rise again, and how long it would take to restore the cold protective layer.

The plankton population was one of the targets of the research. Planktons respond quickly to changes in the quality of water and ""food"" ecosystem. They are a great metric.

Hydro-ecology stations were installed in the lake to continuously monitor the water quality.

German scientists provided modern instruments for studying problems in various layers of the lake. The project was co-funded by the German government.

##Yerevan municipal elections: voting results by each district 

The map shows how each district voted on the election day. The ruling QP and opposition Republic parties are counted together due to friendly ties. The three other opposition parties are counted as one. Here is how the districts voted:

Ajapnyak: ruling

Davtashen: ruling

Arabkir: opposition

Zeytun: ruling

Avan: opposition

Nor-Nork: opposition

Nork-Marash: ruling

Kentron: opposition

Malatia: ruling

Shengavit: ruling

Erebuni: ruling

##The Guardian Editorial Board: Ethnic Armenians are pouring out of the enclave. But the US and Europe must press Azerbaijan to respect the rights of those who remain

>What is clear is that few are willing to take the risk of staying. The context is a months-long blockade, which left residents without food or medicines; the warnings from Ilham Aliyev, the autocratic president of Azerbaijan, to “bend your necks”; last week’s military offensive, during which civilians, including children, were killed; and claims of abuses by Azerbaijan’s troops

##Armenia asks the World Court to require Azerbaijan to withdraw its forces from Nagorno-Karabakh civilian settlements: 

(1) Azerbaijan shall refrain from taking any actions aimed at displacing the remaining ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, or preventing the safe and expeditious return to their homes of persons displaced in the course of the recent military attack, while permitting those who wish to leave Nagorno-Karabakh to do so without any hindrance;

(2) Azerbaijan shall withdraw all military and law-enforcement personnel from all civilian establishments in Nagorno-Karabakh occupied as a result of its armed attack on 19 September 2023;

##equal party 

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan believed that by recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan it would be possible to use international mechanisms to ensure the rights and protections of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. Why did this strategy fail?

**RULING MP:** Armenia did everything possible to help organize negotiations between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan under a Western format with international mechanisms. These negotiations did not take place for obscure reasons. We witnessed a coup in Nagorno-Karabakh. The organizers of the coup claimed that the replacement of the government would *improve* Nagorno-Karabakh's security. But it unfolded differently and they capitulated within a few days. They should have followed Armenia's advice and agreed to negotiate. *[Nagorno-Karabakh rejected the first offer, Azerbaijan rejected the second offer]*

**REPORTER:** Samvel Babayan was holding separate negotiations with Azerbaijan. What can you tell us about his 23-point document?

**RULING MP:** Samvel Babayan realized where this was all headed so he organized his own initiative as a last-ditch effort. He was able to reach certain agreements with Azerbaijan but official Stepanakert was still dismissive.

**REPORTER:** How was Babayan able to find a common language with Azerbaijan?

**RULING MP:** By not being a [Russian] agent.

President Shahramanyan signed a decree on Thursday to dissolve the state. He urged the fleeing population to read and consider Azerbaijan's ""offer"" to remain in Nagorno-Karabakh. 

**ARTAK BEGLARYAN:** Artsakh President’s decree on dissolving the Republic is illegitimate: (1) No President has the power to dissolve the Republic formed by the people with referendum; (2) That decree was signed as a result of Azerbaijani aggression & threat of force. It’s null & void.

##Armenian parliament leader accuses Russia of adopting the same language as Turkey and Azerbaijan; accuses [Russia] of having ""lust for power"" against Ukraine and attempting to overthrow the Armenian government

Alen Simonyan is in Dublin for the European Conference of Presidents of Parliament.

**SIMONYAN:** The challenges facing liberalism and representative democracy are profound. Robust solutions are imperative. 

Look no further than the war in Ukraine to witness the lust for power throughout the world, through the instrument of force. This anti-democratic regression occurs to the detriment of human rights and conflicts with the collective values outlined in the European Convention on Human Rights.

We are acutely aware of the pivotal role that democracy plays in safeguarding human rights and promoting the common good. 
Among the threats that undermine the foundations of this political order are autocratic governance and justice unrealized. 

Armenia knows the value of true democracy. The fortification of democracy through the strengthening of institutions, legislative improvements, and reforms in governance is a priority for us. Our commitment to democratic principles was the most significant factor enabling us to overcome the serious political crisis resulting from the devastating 44-day war instigated by Azerbaijan against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. 

Peace and democracy are interlinked, and governments facing existential threats are under enormous pressure to realize the mandates they were elected to carry out. The war in Nagorno-Karabakh revealed that autocratic regimes, based on the notion that “might is right,” often resolve conflicts through military force, bypassing international mediation.

Today, our democracy continues to face numerous tests. It is endangered by external factors - none greater than military threats to our security and territorial integrity. Understandably, the constant threat of violence has a dire effect on the welfare of our society. Through its drumbeat of hateful, xenophobic rhetoric - accompanied by ultimatums and military aggression - Azerbaijan has created a toxic atmosphere and poisoned the peace process.

Feckless responses from the international community have created in Azerbaijan a sense of impunity, worsening the situation in the region. 

Azerbaijani actions are not confined to Nagorno-Karabakh but extend to the sovereign territories of Armenia, some of which remain under Azerbaijan’s control. Azerbaijan’s approach is to impose its preferred solutions on Armenia through force.

I was not surprised that our Turkish colleague approved the use of military force against the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh. I am not surprised that Turkiye, Azerbaijan and Russia are often using the same rhetoric. What I am surprised by is that they are doing so here, at the organization that was founded for the protection of human rights.

Despite the presence of the Russian peacekeepers, Azerbaijan unleashed another large-scale military attack against Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. As I speak, in fulfillment of Azerbaijan’s ethnic cleansing plan, the exodus of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, is underway.

Through its actions, which minimized international efforts to build peace in the South Caucasus, Azerbaijan has called into question its fitness to be a member of the Council of Europe.

October 5th meeting in Granada will be a step forward. Armenia strongly endorses peace. We welcome future transport arrangements that respect the principles of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and reciprocity. We call on the international community, including the Council of Europe, to support this process.

Today, a hybrid war is being waged by certain countries against Armenia. Its goals are twofold: overthrow the democratically elected government and discredit the notion of representative democracy itself. 

Democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights, and peaceful co-existence are the pillars upon which humankind should live in peace and harmony. This is true not only within democratic states individually but also among them collectively. Together - and perhaps only together - can we prevail over the troubles of our time. The center must hold. //

##several Armenian NGOs urge the government to immediately withdraw from CSTO, remove the Russian military base, and counter Russia's attempts to destabilize Armenia internally 

**NGOs:** Since the signing of the Nov. 9 agreement, Russia has repeatedly failed to follow its obligations and has chosen to side with Azerbaijan repeatedly. Lately, Russia has been destabilizing Armenia and threatening its sovereignty. We demand the government of Armenia to:

(1) Thwart all attempts by Russia to intervene in our internal political processes.

(2) Cancel all AM-RU television re-broadcasting agreements. Require cable operators to shut down Russian channels that are engaged in anti-Armenia propaganda or broadcast calls against the sovereignty of Armenia. 

(3) Launch an official process to withdraw from CSTO. Create necessary conditions to increase military-technical cooperation with the West.

(4) Transfer all border duties to Armenian agents in Zvartnots airport, AM-TR and AM-IR borders, as stipulated by the 1991 AM-RU agreement.

(5) Launch an official process to withdraw the 102nd Russian military base from Armenia.

##interview with Informed Citizens NGO chief Daniel Ioannesian 

**REPORTER:** An outlet with ties to the Armenian government reports that Armenia wants Russia to return the $400M that was transferred for purchasing weapons. The sum was paid 2 years ago, well before the Ukraine war, yet even then Russia failed to deliver them. Russia reportedly doesn't want to return the funds because the ""contracts have not been canceled yet"". How accurate is this report?

**DANIEL:** I can verify that Armenia has transferred $400M and received nothing so far. Sure, the delivery of *some* of the weapons was expected to take years, but according to the contracts, Russia should have delivered $150M in arms by now. It's overdue. I don't think it will ever arrive. (1) Russia doesn't want to arm the Armenian army. (2) Russia itself needs those weapons. 

$400M is not a small sum. We have alternative markets today. If we leave the CSTO, other markets can offer better options. No Western official in their right mind would want to risk selling serious weapons to a country that's formally associated with Russia. 

**REPORTER:** Can Armenia nationalize Russian assets, companies owned and operated by the Russian state, if they refuse to refund it?

**DANIEL:** Գույք պարտքի դիմաց *[a reference to Kocharyan handing over Armenian infrastructure to Russia ""to pay off the debt""]*. I'm not an expert in that field. It's a legal issue. Can we enter arbitration or not. I don't know.

**REPORTER:** Russia believes Armenia is not a good ally.

**DANIEL:** Seriously? The issues with Russia began after it refused to acknowledge and condemn the invasion of Armenia proper by Azerbaijan, despite having contractual obligations. Not a single CSTO country helped Armenia. Can you imagine if NATO acted this spinelessly? Even after everything Turkey had done to piss off the West, they still supported Turkey when it faced terror threats. 

What else is Armenia supposed to do to please Russia? We have given them our nuclear field, railways, gas monopoly, ownership of pipes, an effective monopoly in electricity exports, and a membership to the EAEU that is actually harmful to us. If we exit the EAEU right now, the prices of many products on our shelves will plummet by 10%-80%. What else does Russia want us to give them?

**REPORTER:** To give them our membership in the Russian Union with Belarus.

**DANIEL:** [Dick] is what we should give them.

**REPORTER:** Why is there a crisis in AM-RU relations?

**DANIEL:** It's obvious now that the only thing Russia can give us is enmity. Armenia is taking steps to show the West that Armenia's position has changed. We need Western support right now. But the West is very cautious because they have been f&%ked over by Serj once. Serj spent 3.5 years negotiating with the EU to then make a U-turn and join Russia. It was a serious damage to Armenia's reputation as a trustworthy partner. That is what I hear a lot, including very recently from a German official.

**REPORTER:** What can the West do for Armenia?

**DANIEL:** (1) Military-technical cooperation, (2) Energy independence, (3) Economic cooperation and easier exports to Europe.

Our food producers will face major issues if Russia bans Armenian products. Russia will obviously use this tool to pressure us. We need Europe as an alternative destination. We need Europe to help us increase production and quality standards. 

As for energy, the EU can help us through various programs. Low-interest loans for solar panel installations, energy-efficient construction and renovation, etc. Europe should help us with 2-3 large energy projects:

Build a large electricity storage facility. Our nuclear plant produces a fixed amount of energy at all times. Its nighttime production is not being used. To make things worse, if we build a new nuclear plant with a 2x capacity, the utilization of nighttime production will become an even bigger problem. We need to store that electricity somewhere. Don't think of it like battery storage. It should be a facility. Let's say two reservoirs at different altitudes. The nighttime electricity could be used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir. During the daytime, when we need more electricity, the water can pour back into the lower reservoir and generate electricity like a hydropower plant. *[might as well connect a power strip to itself for unlimited energy]*.

Armenia must join the proposed Azerbaijan-Georgia-Romania-Hungary electric network and export electricity to Europe. We will be in a better position than Georgia and Azerbaijan. We could sell the nighttime excess electricity to Europe. //

##Indian engineers are building reinforced border positions: Andranik Kocharyan, ranking ruling MP

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan and Turkey want a ""Zangezur corridor"". 

**ANDRANIK:** No corridor. Stop beating a dead horse. I don't know why they still call it that way. 

Our best protection is our army and strong borders. One of these days I'm going to invite every media outlet and take you to the southern borders so you can see the new engineering structures. I want you to *feel* the amount of dedicated work that was done over the past several months.

Indian workers were part of this process. They are my brothers. They are doing something that many Armenians didn't want to do. We must have engineering squads, we must take care of our state, and we must feel like we own our country.

I spoke with Samvel Babayan shortly before his departure to Armenia. I urged him to be careful and not get arrested while entering Armenia. He said he won't get arrested, but if he does, he will ""take a few Azeris with him to Armenia"". Babayan and Azerbaijani authorities have a complicated history dating back to the 1st war. //

##Կենացները քաղցրանում են։ Hayk Marutyan is facing a dillema 

The context is in [Thursday report](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16uv5ol/armenias_defense_budget_to_reach_14b_exodus/): The shaky alliance between the 3 opposition forces fell apart yesterday. Marutyan, the lead candidate for Yerevan mayor, has called for new elections after learning that Dog's party could not secure enough votes for his appointment. In order for new elections to be held, the 33 opposition Council members (trio) must unanimously boycott the first session. Marutyan fears that if at least one of Dog's members shows up, the Council will have the quorum to organize a session and elect the ruling party's Tigran Avinyan as the mayor. 

##... new developments 

Dog is holding Marutyan hostage. He wants Marutyan and the former regime to sign a 3-way contract. In exchange for helping to boycott the first session and triggering new elections, Dog wants written guarantees that his party members will be appointed to lead a third of all Yerevan districts.

Marutyan had earlier categorically refused to sign any formal contract with them. He has until October 10 to decide.

If Marutyan refuses, Dog could ""help"" Avinyan get elected while settling for minority seats and calling it a day. But if Dog triggers new elections, it's a big gamble because he risks being wiped out in the event of higher voter turnout. Avinyan suddenly has a chance to become the mayor if Dog chickens out.

##Shushi battles / eye-witness account by a soldier
 
Q: did you participate in Shushi battles?
 
A: Yes. For 4 days. It began on the night of November 3rd. We were attacked by an infantry followed by artillery strikes. They were hitting our artillery and infantry. When we moved down to the village [Qarin Tak?] they began using airforce, drones, artillery, cluster bombs, etc.  
 
We fired at each other for two days nonstop. They had around 800 losses. We were told to leave from there, followed by four Azeri jets bombing the area where we were.
 
They began firing from another location. Then it stopped. Around November 12th Shushi was ours but Karabakh already wasn't.
 
Q: where there Azeris in Shushi?
 
A: Yes. We held one part of the city, while Azeris held another. We left on November 14th. 
 
Q: How did you leave?
 
A: Russian peacekeepers came and we left without shooting.
 
Q: how many wounded did you have?
 
A: none. There were 12 of us.
 
Q: how old are you?
 
A: 19. I'm a conscript.
 
Q: how far away were Azeris?
 
A: around 100 meters.

##political turmoil continues // coup guys, howlers, walls, and soldiers
 
Yesterday a group of acting/former security service officials and opposition figures were arrested [under the suspicion of organizing an assassination against PM Pashinyan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-armenia-security-premier/armenia-says-prevented-assassination-attempt-on-prime-minister-idUSKBN27U0P1). An audio call was leaked. Some of them were kept in jail by a judge, while others were released before the trial.
 
Hours later Pashinyan wrote: ""Today I watched videos shared by dozens of soldiers in the front lines. I'm amazed by their insight. Guys, you are right. I'm waiting for you in Yerevan to finally solve the problem of those howling under the walls. I'm proud of you.""
 
The opposition called it a threat of physical violence and urged law enforcement to take action. An opposition figure wrote, ""Pashinyan will soon go underground"".
 
The Human Rights Ombudsman asked the public not to share hateful social media posts.

An opposition figure Andranik Tevanyan urged ruling QP MPs to resign otherwise ""they'll be held accountable"". ""Any MP who leaves the party will be given a humanitarian path to exit. Otherwise, everyone will sign under the agreement of capitulation and self-destruction.""

Three QP MPs had resigned amid the turmoil.
 
**Prime Minister office chief of staff:** the latest comment by PM was interpreted in various ways. Many thought of it as an attempt to incite a civil war. I assure you it was a misunderstanding. The post was a ""thank you"" to the heroic men who fought in front lines for weeks, who are now calling for the public not to fall for provocations and to unite for the sake of Armenia and Artsakh.
 
The U.S. Ambassador spoke with QP Party leader Lilith Makunts. Both reaffirmed their joint commitment to strengthening democracy and the rule of law in Armenia. ""Political violence & intimidation have no place in a democratic society,"" said the Ambassador.""
 
Artsakh president Arayik has called for political peace in Armenia. He added that the process of recovering bodies continues. 150 more bodies were transferred from Shushi.
 
 https://news.am/arm/news/613638.html
 
President Sarkissian has called for restraint and vigilance despite the pain. 
 
 https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034968.html
 
**Pashinyan:** regarding my earlier Facebook post. I wrote that I await them in Yerevan. Some interpreted that as a call for civil war and clashes. If you watch the videos I responded to, the soldiers are returning home after being discharged, without weapons. I chose to publicly announce a meeting with them upon their return. No one is returning from the front lines with weapons. 

As for the phrase ""those howling under the walls"", I chose to use that harsh statement because certain official bodies also used it (maybe referring to a judge who earlier made a statement about ""howling"", followed by assassination suspect Arthur Vanetsyan being released from jail).
 
When the frontline soldiers return, we'll find out answers to many questions and put an end to the conspiracy theories about political-military leadership.
 
I spoke with the police to make sure none of the returning soldiers have weapons.

The opposition parties resumed their rallies. The demands are the same: Pashinyan should resign, they won't hold any meetings or discussions with him. They marched to the prosecutors' office. ""Nikol, the public will pay your pension and ensure your safety, just leave,"" said an ARF official.

Prosecutors will appeal the lower court decision that kept Arthur Vanetsyan out of jail. He is one of the former officials suspected of organizing a coup and assassination of the Prime Minister. The lower court didn't find enough evidence to keep him locked up pre-trial.
 
Another suspect, Vahram Baghdasaryan, was also released by the court.

Former general prosecutor Gevorg Kostanyan urged his ex-colleague prosecutors and cops to join their side and disobey the government. 
 
Context: Kostanyan is on the run. He was accused of being the ""handler"" who went between several law enforcement agencies in March 2008 to coordinate the disposal of bullet shells that the police forced fired at protesters. At the time, 8 protestors were killed. After the arrival of Pashinyan, a felony case was launched over the incident. Former president Kocharyan [president at the time of the incident] and several of his allies were charged.

**Prosecutors urge opposition not to pressure law enforcement:**
 
Lately, individuals who have recently been prosecuted in various criminal cases, who evaded justice, and have the prospect of criminal liability, as well as their supporters, have been trying to manipulate the law enforcement bodies with emotional statements to influence their actions.
 
The prosecutors and law enforcement are apolitical bodies. We condemn any attempts to involve them in political processes.
 
[The opposition had earlier publicly urged the army and the law enforcement to join them against the Prime Minister]:

Human rights ombudsman condemned opposition and government figures for using provocative language.

##Pashinyan about the tense atmosphere and violence
 
Look at what happened to Parliament Speaker Ararat Mirzoyan (he was severely beaten by opposition activists, doctors saved his life with surgeries). Nothing of this kind has happened to opposition figures in the past 2.5 years (when he came into office). The majority of opposition did not even condemn the November 10th riots.
 
I expect the opposition to publicly state that they are against political violence and the use of weapons. 
When the internal atmosphere improves, we'll be able to have a dialogue with the opposition to together overcome the situation.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034987.html
 
 
 
 
##Pashinyan about the negotiations process
 
Artsakh's legal status must become the heart of the negotiation process with new intensity and new capacity. (Earlier he complained that for the last 25 years, the main negotiations were over giving lands to Azerbaijan with not enough emphasis on Artsakh status)
 
 
##Pashinyan about soldiers
 
We have several hundred missing soldiers. I hope for the best. Yesterday several missing soldiers were found alive.
 
Exchanging POWs will happen after the exchange of bodies. There will be a day of mourning once the process completes.
 
We must help the wounded soldiers, and soldiers' family members now. There needs to be a continuous communication with them. The soldier must see that the country stands by him. There will be vocational training courses for those who want to change professions.

##Pashinyan about cooperating with the opposition
 
[Opposition says they can change the document to make it more favorable.] I have not received such an offer from them on how to improve the document's terms. Going backward and changing the terms of the signed document means changing the military status, which is impractical today.
 
As for the future negotiations process, the document leaves many points for future clarification. During these clarifications, all the  
suggestions will be taken into account, and we will try to implement the best ones.

##Pashinyan about the negotiation process before the war and his responsibility
 
By May 2018 (before he took the office), the negotiation process had already crossed the point of no return. It was all about giving lands to Azerbaijan in exchange for nothing. Some HHK officials (today opposition) were publicly stating that there are complications and we'd need to give away lands.
 
That means there are three options: either those former officials were oracles, or I'm a traitor, or the former officials already knew where the negotiations had reached.
 
My administration tried to change the course of negotiations to make it more favorable. Unfortunately, we couldn't. There was already an international consensus that the lands must be given to Azerbaijan without any conditions.
 
Were we supposed to give away the lands? We tried to resist through negotiations. I also took steps to prepare the army by improving the armament.
 
I'm blamed for signing and giving away lands today. I'm also blamed for not giving them away sooner.
 
Our army fought for as long as it was possible.
 
There is no doubt that I am the number one public official responsible for the situation. I will stand before our people. However, the public should know all these details to make conclusions.

##Pashinyan about accusations of keeping other officials in dark
 
We held two security council meetings during the war, participated by Parliamentary parties, the President, the Church leader.
 
We held separate meetings with non-Parliamentary opposition parties to discuss the situation. They were aware of the trends.
 
Some of the decisions had to be made within hours at the request of the military, so we couldn't discuss it with opposition first.

##Pashinyan addressing rumors about ""giving away Shushi""
 
The army fought a heroic battle until the last second, but the Armenian side lost Shushi because the enemy managed to penetrate the city. Shushi was not handed over. Artsakh president mentioned today about recovering 150 more bodies from Shushi. If the city was ""given away"", then who ordered them to fight.
 
There were rumors about traitors inside Shushi who gave specific orders. The law enforcement questioned the person who spread the rumors to learn more details, but the person refused to answers questions.  
 
The truth is painful, but we lost Shushi because the enemy was able to break in.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034993.html
 

##Pashinyan addressing opposition rumors about U.S.
 
Q: is it true that you consulted with the US before signing the Document?
 
A: of course not. During this war, I've spoken with the US five times: three with O'Brian and two with Pompeo. We discussed suggestions from the US. On the other hand, there were days when I spoke with Putin five times a day.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034982.html
 
 
 
##Pashinyan about Artsakh army
 
Artsakh will continue to have it's Defense Army, even after signing of the document. The army will have the same status. It must develop, strengthen, and be the guarantor of Artsakh sovereignty.

##Pashinyan meets political parties in Parliament for a 2-hour Q&A
 
##Q: were there calculations before the war on how long we could last in the event of war, considering resource discrepancy?
 
We discussed this during the Security Council meetings on several occasions. Our conclusion was that we would have enough resources to resist aggression by the Azerbaijani army. 
 
##Q: why weren't there any steps to prevent the war?
 
Preventing a war was always on our agenda, but it has never been viewed as ""at the cost of everything and anything"". Preventing this war would mean ""lands in exchange for peace"" proposal. We would have to give away lands.
 
That would be the continuation of the downward spiral in the negotiations that we've witnessed in the past many years when Armenia would agree to concede, then Azeris would demand more and more. Last year we decided to consolidate our physical power to resist possible attacks.
 


##Q: How can people help Artsakh refugees now?
 
I spoke with the Artsakh president and I'm happy to say that many refugees are now returning to their homes. Over 1,000 by now. The houses should be renovated; our governments will work on it. Lachin corridor will reopen today and the process will expedite.
 
##Q: where was our mistake? What were the shortcomings of air defense? Armament in the past 30 years? 

Our mistake in the past 2.5 years was our inability to close the existing gaps in the army. Although we did have massive achievements in air defense. We purchased TOR,  modernized OSA-AKA units, etc. Practice showed that these weapons aren't enough against the modern high-tech; a technology [Bayraktar] that came into play just in the past few months, and tipped the balance.
 
Overall, Armenia's two biggest strategic mistakes post-1990s war were believing that we could forever avoid a war, and the idea of ""don't give an inch of land"".
 
From 1998, there was only one significant emphasis: the return of 7 regions to Azerbaijan. This was the only clearly defined thing. Let's see what happened in international institutes in the past 25 years: Dozens of documents, resolutions, statements that re-enforced the idea of our requirement to give away lands.
 
We should have chosen: either we give some lands, or we choose war.
 
##Q: my research shows that the size of our conscript army shrank in half in the past 10 years. It was also our mistake that the ruling and opposition parties haven't done enough to address this. The opposition has its share to blame.
 
We are accused of failing foreign policy and giving away lands. So what did the opposition want: not to give away lands, or to avoid a war? You had to pick one.
 
Now they say ""why didn't you give away lands **sooner** to end the war sooner?"". Because the war would not have ended sooner. It could stop under the conditions that we have today [land concessions]. The army and the govt chose to fight for as long as possible. We made our choice and I don't believe that was the wrong choice. Unfortunately, we failed to achieve the desired outcome.
 
##Q: are there plans for internal stability? Any plan on consolidating efforts before future negotiations?
 
We need to condemn and avoid violence. I publicly declare that we don't want or incite civil unrest, and we ask the opposition to also declare that they don't plan to use force. 

If they do, we will have a peaceful dialogue. I have my doubts because when the November 10th riots took place and the Govt/Parliament were attacked, to this day the opposition hasn't condemned it. My appearance today is also an act of dialogue with the opposition.
 
As for future negotiations, our top priority is the Artsakh status, refugee return, economical topics. All our efforts, including the Parliament, should be involved with the process.
 
 
##Q: should there be a dialogue specifically with those opposition parties who are currently ready to be peaceful?
 
Dialogue is possible with any political party, as long as there is a willingness to have one. But they need to condemn violence first. I agree, we should all be careful with emotional statements.
 
 
##Q: about future negotiations & elections

**Q:** what happened to our country was treason; I don't mean the document signed by you. Only during the war did we learn that the defense/MFA wasn't ready. Admit that you and your team failed. Certain officials should resign. As for the negotiation process, unlike [fellow] opposition members, I still believe that you should be the one to find a way out of this situation, and once the roadmap is clear, we need snap elections. If people vote for you again, so be it, continue with the work, but we need a roadmap for the future.
 
**A**: the job of every agency is being analyzed. Our main task right now is to have a discourse under peaceful and democratic conditions. We can't hold elections right now. Once the peaceful atmosphere is restored, and there is no more doubt that the elections would be democratic, we can talk about new elections.
 
I urge all opposition parties to publicly condemn violence and state that they don't plan to use force to achieve things. At the same time, our law enforcement is able to prevent any possible violence.
 
##Q: we should strengthen the army. We are accused of not doing enough to find money to improve the army. People point where the money is. Any plans to recover them?
 
Today we have many former officials who make speeches about Artsakh. They possess millions of dollars worth of [embezzled] properties. These people have no right to speak about Artsakh. It's the money that they stole that could have formed institutes in Armenia. 

We talk about our diplomatic abilities today; our diplomatic potential would have been better had we invested in time. It wasn't done for decades.
 
After coming to power in 2018, we followed the law, we said there won't be vendettas. We created legal methods to recover resources stolen from the public [asset forfeiture law]. These laws are starting to go into effect today. The recovered resources will be invested in our future potential. We cannot do vendettas, however.
 
##Q: any mental health support for soldiers returning from war?
 
Yes. We discussed it with Healthcare Ministry. The private sector and businesses also offered to help with their resources.
 
##Q: as far as I'm aware, in the prior negotiation packages, the status of Shushi was not part of any.
 
The past 2.5 years of negotiations and meetings had left no doubt that preventing the war would require Armenia giving away lands, and still have no status for Artsakh. We would also need to give up the right to discuss Artsakh's legal status in the near future, and also give Shushi. *[Shushi part was later clarified since some people thought he was ""lying"" about Shushi being part of past negotiations]*
 
The opposition is showing a document and saying ""Shushi isn't mentioned in this one"". Yes, Shushi isn't in it, that's why that document was never accepted by Azerbaijan. [He is hinting that Azerbaijan has always wanted Shushi as its major goal and that every time Armenia yielded something, Azeris wanted more.]
 
There are many documents. Was the Kazan document ever signed by Azerbaijan? There was another one before that. Why wasn't neither one of them accepted? Does no one ask?
 
We had certain outcomes that we could have, under certain conditions. There were many documents. We can print a very favorable document and circulate it today, but it's nothing if it's rejected. Some documents are now circulated for propaganda purposes. The opposition is trying to say that at some point we had a better choice but we rejected it.
 
**We had two options after the 2016 clashes began**: give up our rights or defend our rights. Do you not wonder why the 2016 war was stopped but this one wasn't? Do you know under what conditions the 2016 war was stopped? The opposition knew where the negotiation process was as of 2018, when they ""predicted"" a bad outcome upon my election.
 
On the first day, I told you while standing here in Parliament: we can stop the war RIGHT NOW and the conditions that would stop it. The opposition decried the conditions. Now they say ""why didn't you stop"". Are we traitors for fighting?
 
They rightfully blame us for high casualties, but at the same time, they blame us for saving 30,000 soldiers from encirclement by signing the Document. Let them not play oracle now.
 
##Q: can you clarify the Shushi part, about it being or not being in negotiating documents?
 
I think I might not fully understand your context about the Shushi question, since it's being asked again. Are you asking if Shushi was part of the prior negotiation process? Please clarify. In any case, if we could preserve it, we would.
 
**MP Clarifying:** you earlier said that the war could be avoided or stopped if Shushi was given to Azeris. But the Foreign Ministry spokesperson wrote, ""the peace negotiations did not contain a question of giving away Shushi"". This statement caused various interpretations. Clarify the Shushi part before and after the war.
 
**Pashinan**: before the war, during the negotiations, there was always a topic about returning refugees to their homes. When on official-level we tried to obtain clarification on what that would mean, and what would be acceptable by Azerbaijan, it was clear that Azerbaijan always demanded that their refugees return to Shushi. Always. *[Shushi region had a large Azeri population before 90s war. Azeris consider it as their crown jewel and the heart.]*
 
During the war, there were options to stop the war. Not in the very beginning, but at some point (5-7 days into war) Shushi became a demand by Azerbaijan. This is an undeniable fact. *[tldr: on the 5-7th day of the war Armenians thought the army could defend Artsakh so they didn't accept a deal; later the Azeris demanded Shushi so Armenians decided to continue to fight instead of giving it away]*


##Q: the war showed that Armenia's only friend was Russia. did Turkey and Azerbaijan go for war thinking there were cracks in AM-RU relations?
 
Myth number 1: the AM-RU relations are bad that's why this happened. In the past 4-5 years, Russia's stance over Karabakh has not changed.
 
Myth number 2: I was offered to resign to change the outcome of the war, but I refused and cling to power.
 
I had a very direct and frank conversation with [Russians] and I asked if my resignation would change anything. There are people in Parliament who know all these details. Now I'm giving you details I wasn't supposed to; too much transparency. As for AM-RU relations, they were/are/remain strategic.
 
##Q: refugees?
 
We're working on making it possible for refugees to return home and receive government assistance while already in Artsakh. The future negotiations will include discussions about the status of refugees who lost their homes (Hadrut), and possible options for their safe return.
 
##Q: many countries came out of war and became stronger over time. Can we expect peace in the region?
 
We need to analyze how we used our past 2.5 years, but also for the past 30 years. In the past 30 years, we lived with the idea of ""not an inch of land"" and ""prevent war"", while in reality, we had to choose between the two. 

We had to pick one and focus on it. We made our choice [prepare for war instead of giving the adjacent regions] in the past 2.5 years and we lost, and I carry full responsibility.
 
How many of you have visited the adjacent territories [that are will be soon given to Azerbaijan]? What work has been done in those regions in the past 30 years? [the former regime is accused of intentionally investing less money in 7 adjacent regions, expecting that one day they might belong to Azerbaijan].
 
For 30 years we screamed about the army being the institute with the highest rating, yet everyone tried to avoid serving in it. Was this not supposed to have its consequences?
 
We need to review our model of patriotism. Let me give a bribe, escape the army, then make a toast to honor the army. Did we not think about this for 30 years?
 
When we took a $10 bribe to vote for certain political parties for 30 years, when we evaded taxes, the large businesses evaded taxes then gave some donations and received praise in return; was this all going to go without consequences?
 
I carry full responsibility for what had happened in the past 30 years. No one else does. I will stand in the court of public opinion, but I raise questions and I demand the answers.
 
When for 30 years the public office was a way to embezzle public resources and we all knew and did nothing, aren't we not supposed to answer for it? We embezzled 30 years of our history.
 
If Shushi was ""sold"", then it was sold in the past 30 years. Shushi is a grim-looking poor city. If you wanted Shushi, why did you keep it in that poor condition?
 
Did you want those 7 regions? Then why did you not invest in them? They criticize me for visiting the Artsakh president's inauguration in Shushi. ""Why did you do it in Shushi"". For 30 years, the elites called Shushi an Armenian city, yet the president doesn't have the right to hold a ceremony there?
 
Shushi was sold when for 30 years the headlines wrote ""Shushi is Armenian"", yet in their minds, it wasn't.
 
What did you invest in Shushi? A few private donors gave charity. What else was done for Shushi by public officials? Shushi wasn't given on November 10th. Shushi was given when unruly weeds grew there for 30 years.
 
##Q: how can we solve the Artsakh conflict now to prevent passing it to future generations?
 
We need to consolidate our resources. We need Armenians and Artsakh Armenians to live on their lands and create and prosper. It all comes down to education. Bribing to avoid military service is also part of education. We need a change of mentality. For 30 years we never made any major education reforms. The education system was a servant of the acting political party.
 
##Q: when will we have the final number of casualties?
 
Identification and body exchange continues. We don't have final numbers. Some people were wondering if there were battles for Shushi. All you need to do is to look at the number of casualties on both sides in Shushi. 300 Armenian bodies were recovered in the past few days from Shushi.
 
Some have spread rumors about generals and politicians ordering not to fight for Shushi. The law enforcement invited them to clarify the rumors. When asked by police to testify, the rumor-spreaders tell stories of ""someone who I knew was sitting somewhere when someone came"" yadda yadda. 


##Q: mobilization of troops?
 
The mobilization system is outdated. The army structure and its functional roles should undergo significant reforms. We have contractors. Their size increased in the past 7-8 years. 

Contract service is also a job place where villages earn extra money alongside their daily work. They have a great role in defending the border. However, during a major war, there is a problem with involving them in various types of activities. The contractors don't have the efficiency of special tasks. Since 2019 we worked on this. The 3rd Army Corps underwent reforms.
 
 
##Q: any plans to strengthen ties with the diaspora?
 
45 years ago, over 70% of diasporan Armenians were affiliated with one diasporan organization or another. Today the picture is reversed. The majority are detached. We need to rebuild the connection.

##Artsakh refugees returning home / aid / school
 
The Armenian government will provide a one-time 68,000 Dram financial aid to refugees in addition to humanitarian aid. An additional 15,000 Drams if the person doesn't have a property in Armenia.
 
The government receives lots of calls from refugees who want info about how to return home. They no longer need paperwork to be able to reach Stepanakert.
 
The second group of Artsakh residents has moved back to Artsakh, accompanied by Russian peacekeepers. 19 buses transported 475 people, bringing the total from yesterday to 725.
 
Stepanakert's N2 school has partially resumed the work. Children can register for classes.
 
Russian peacekeepers cleared a 1km Lachin road from landmines. 27 damaged vehicles were removed from the roadside.

9/24/2023,"Nagorno-Karabakh turns into ghetto deprived of electricity, fuel, food, ability to travel and find family members // UN Security Council: Possible outcomes // Interviews & analysis // No party disputes Yerevan election results // Economic Freedom Index","##video shows daily life in Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert 

Azerbaijan has turned Nagorno-Karabakh into an open-air ghetto. The power grid was shut off by Azerbaijani soldiers after the capturing of civilian settlements and infrastructure. 

The Lachin corridor remains closed to travelers and unobstructed aid, despite the World Court's order for Azerbaijan to open it.

Azerbaijani soldiers have set up roadblocks on all major arteries and opened fire at vehicles passing through inner roads in Nagorno-Karabakh (e.g. at peacekeepers), making it impossible for residents to safely travel to nearby concentration camps where they could receive some amount of food and assistance.

Thousands of civilians spent last night under open air in a dysfunctional airport near the capital. Azerbaijan has long threatened to shoot down any non-peacekeeping aircraft that lands or departs the airport.

Armenia has called for the deployment of UN-mandated peacekeepers and an international fact-finding mission in Nagorno-Karabakh.

##Washington Post article by ex-chief prosecutor at ICC Luis Moreno Ocampo: ""Call what is happening in Nagorno-Karabakh by its proper name""

>In international law, the Genocide Convention of 1948 makes it clear that one way to commit the crime is by “deliberately inflicting on [a] group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part” (Article II c). By blocking the Lachin Corridor, Aliyev turned Nagorno-Karabakh into a vast concentration camp for 120,000 Armenians. This week’s military intervention added killing (Article II a) and causing serious bodily and mental harm (Article II b) to the ledger.

>The world must call the crime by its proper name. Resistance to using the term “genocide” has been a long-standing problem in international affairs. In April 1994, most U.N. Security Council members refused to label the mass killings in Rwanda as genocide. Little has changed in 30 years.

>Azerbaijan’s ambitions extend beyond Nagorno-Karabakh. Since 2010, Aliyev has regularly talked about Armenia itself as “Western Azerbaijan,” echoing long-standing Azerbaijani claims that Armenia as a whole is an illegitimate state. As recently as December, he said that “present-day Armenia is our land.”

##the surrender of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh could allow Russia to collect thousands of heavy and light weaponry and use them against Ukraine

Azerbaijan and Russia have forced Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians to lay down their arms. Thousands of pieces of weapons have already been surrendered. Russia claims the loot will be transferred to Azerbaijan but some believe they will end up using them against Ukraine. Interview with analyst Hovsep Khurshudyan:

**REPORTER:** What can you tell us about the UNSC session?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** It helped us understand each country's position and the changes since the last session. The process of holding a session itself serves as a preventative and restraining measure. FM Mirzoyan's statement was very harsh this time, with some scolding language aimed at the UNSC over its prior inaction.  

**REPORTER:** Did the countries change their rhetoric?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Some Armenians have interpreted the speeches by France and the U.S. as milder, but that is not the case. This time the U.S. urged for an international mission to be dispatched to Nagorno-Karabakh. This is a new element. 

It's still necessary to convert speech into action. It won't be easy because Azerbaijan and Russia will resist the entry of an international mission into Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia brags that its peacekeepers are successfully handling the situation. This claim was bolstered by the advertisement of the death of several peacekeepers.

On the other hand, Germany has joined Armenia. If during the previous session Azerbaijan had Turkey while Armenia had the EU, this time Armenia had the EU and Germany.

Germany was represented by a ranking official: the foreign minister. She gave a strongly anti-Azerbaijan speech. This was followed by German PM Scholz accusing Azerbaijan of breaking its promises not to attack. This was a blow to Azerbaijan's reputation as a trustworthy actor.

China gave a negative speech and promoted Russia's stance that this is an Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. They are dragging Armenia into this.

We had a better chance of a resolution after the previous UNSC session but we saw a cautious approach at the time. For example, the U.S. was afraid that the adoption of a resolution would prompt Azerbaijan to abandon peace talks and attack. But this was a miscalculation because that attack ended up occurring regardless. 

Today we should focus on the possibility of sending an international mission to Nagorno-Karabakh, the framework of NK-AZ negotiations, and the continuation of AM-AZ negotiations. 

The Yevlakh negotiations haven't ended yet but we already see images of Nagorno-Karabakh soldiers surrendering weapons. We don't even know what their final destination is. It's possible that Russia will take them to Ukraine. It's unfortunate that it was impossible for Nagorno-Karabakh to use this equipment for self-defense. 

**REPORTER:** Could Russia actually do it?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Very much possible. Russia has always viewed Nagorno-Karabakh as a tool to promote its interests and not as a homeland of people who need protections secured under the Nov. 9 agreement.

What is the Kremlin's message to Armenians today? If you don't overthrow Pashinyan, there will be a genocide. We just need the Kremlin to admit that they will be the organizers if their orders aren't carried out in Yerevan.

As one famous Russian writer once said, Russia is a land of lords and slaves. Armenia is the slave. This is how the Kremlin views relations with other states. We saw this in Ukraine, too. Fellow Slavic Ukrainians suddenly became ""Benderite fascists"".

**REPORTER:** Will the pro-Russian opposition be able to remove Pashinyan?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Not without a foreign intervention. They were hoping for Pashinyan to drag Armenia into this conflict so Armenia could sustain losses, spelling doom for Pashinyan. 

**REPORTER:** During the UNSC session, Germany stated that no foreign power should attempt to destabilize democracy in Armenia. Are they referring to ongoing pro-Russian protests?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Isn't it obvious? The only person from the Russian regime who hasn't openly supported the protests yet is Vladimir Putin himself.

**REPORTER:** For the first time, the FM of Armenia called for the deployment of UN-mandated peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. Is this realistic after Nagorno-Karabakh has agreed to surrender arms?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Quite the contrary. The disarming of the Nagorno-Karabakh army would contribute to the deployment of UN-mandated peacekeepers because they are more defenseless now. FM Mirzoyan called for UN-mandated peacekeepers but did not specify from which country or countries. Will they be Russians but now with a mandate or a mixed contingent? Not specifying was the right decision.

**STEPAN:** I have received information through diplomatic channels that the U.S. and France are currently discussing possible scenarios for a resolution and response. What we saw on Sept. 21st was the public phase. Afterward, the UNSC members hold private meetings. They are currently holding talks with various UN observers and fact-finding missions about sending a mission to Nagorno-Karabakh.

There seems to be a consensus that Germany gave the strongest speech. But Germany was invited as a guest. We should focus on the states whose signature will play a decisive role. Today France and the U.S. are working together. Germany's stance will be a positive influence.

##interview with VOMA military camp leader Vova Vartanov: Azerbaijan wanted the disarmament of Nangorno-Karabakh army but at the same time did not allow the removal of tanks from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, fearing it would strengthen Armenia

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh has agreed to lay down the arms. What will be the consequences?

**VOVA:** Having your own defense army is a lot better than relying on peacekeepers from any country because they have always proven themselves to be biased.

Azeri army regularly fires at our [Republic of Armenia] soldiers who attempt to conduct engineering work on the AM-AZ border. But engineering work doesn't have to be done only at the frontline. We need a second line of defense 1-2 kilometers deep. This wasn't done in Nagorno-Karabakh so Azeris were able to break through the line on the first day. 

There are some idiot politicians in Armenia who are against building this second line of defense. Two weeks ago, one politician referred to VOMA's efforts to build reinforced structures as ""treason"" because he thought we intended to surrender the territories between the 1st and 2nd lines. 

The lines need some depth. This was missing in the Martuni-Askeran-Stepanakert juncture in Nagorno-Karabakh. That's where Azerbaijan's first strike was. They wanted to split the Nagorno-Karabakh army into three. Some Nagorno-Karabakh soldiers went to the mountains afterward. I won't rule out there are still resistance fights.

**REPORTER:** Did Nagorno-Karabakh have enough power to resist?

**VOVA:** They could have resisted for a long time had they not been split into pieces and if they had better logistics. It would be possible to put up a strong resistance in the forests and mountains as well. But for that, they needed education and reinforced defense lines.

**REPORTER:** Did Nagorno-Karabakh have enough weapons to resist?

**VOVA:** Approximately half of Armenia's weapons were left in Nagorno-Karabakh. Per capita, there were more weapons and ammunition to defend 120,000 residents of Nagorno-Karabakh than 3 million residents of Armenia. They had up to 150 tanks in Nagorno-Karabakh. Our ""friend"" Russia will soon take them away. 

**REPORTER:** What will be the fate of those tanks?

**VOVA:** According to the media, Russia is supposed to collect them.

**REPORTER:** Could Russia use them against Ukraine?

**VOVA:** Who cares? The Ukrainian government has been anti-Armenia. They aren't pro-Azerbaijan either, they just ""like"" Azerbaijani-related online posts. 

**REPORTER:** What other weapons did Nagorno-Karabakh have?

**VOVA:** Many other types. Our so-called ""friends"" will soon collect them and announce the numbers.

**REPORTER:** Did Armenia have an army in Nagorno-Karabakh?

**VOVA:** No. [Way before this attack] Armenia had reached an agreement to accept 56 tanks that were to be removed by Russia from Nagorno-Karabakh. 

I won't rule out that the Lachin blockade began due to disagreements around the Nagorno-Karabakh armament. At the time, there was an agreement to move 50+ tanks to Armenia. This would have made Armenia stronger. Azerbaijan probably didn't like it and maintained a blockade. There was already an agreement to transfer the weapons. 

**REPORTER:** Does that mean Armenia was the one disarming Nagorno-Karabakh?

**VOVA:** It's not that simple. Nagorno-Karabakh had an excessive number of tanks. Too many isn't always better. Their transfer would have significantly helped one of the Army Corpses in Armenia. I suspect this was the primary reason why the blockade began.

**REPORTER:** Did Russian peacekeepers do anything when the attack began?

**VOVA:** They aren't allowed to shoot unless there is a direct threat to them. About 5 peacekeepers stood by 15 Nagorno-Karabakh defense soldiers and helped them defend one of the assaulted positions for an entire day.

**REPORTER:** Several peacekeepers were ambushed and killed by an accident. 

**VOVA:** It can't be an accident. The vehicle was clearly marked as non-Armenian. You don't ""accidentally"" shoot everyone inside. They were just trying to send a message. My issue isn't with Russian peacekeepers on the ground, my issue is with the Kremlin.

The 102nd Russian military base in Armenia should have immediately been dispatched to assist Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. They should have defended their own citizens [peacekeepers] in Nagorno-Karabakh. De jure this would have been a neutral act, separate from AM-RU or NK-RU relations. But Russia didn't even do that, proving that they are an ally on paper only. They sometimes even refuse to counter anti-Armenian decisions made by Azerbaijan or Turkey.  

Russian propagandists and the peddlers of this propaganda, such as  Dmitri Medvedev, are lying when they claim this is all the fault of one person *[Nikol]*. If this was about one person, Russia could find a way to replace him. Putin could defend Armenia, raise his own reputation in Armenia, and then urge Armenians to appoint a pro-Russian candidate of his choice. Grateful Armenian public would rush to support Putin's chosen candidate.

In reality, Russia has different interests. They need Turkey. That's why they've reached an agreement with Erdogan. They are building a gas hub to bypass the Western embargo. Russia needs BABLO more than it needs Armenia. Russia loves gaslighting while Medvedev loves going KRUTIT.  

**REPORTER:** Is this it? Is this the end of the road for Artsakh?

**VOVA:** Learn from Azeris. They were asking the same question in 1994. Now it's our turn to exercise and repeat ""Artsakh bizimdir"".

##тот, кто больше врет, получит половину Кремля

Pashinyan's chief of staff has accused Russian state propagandists of intentionally promoting fake news to destabilize the situation in Armenia. 

He brought the example of a report claiming that several protesters were able to break into the Government building where they supposedly discovered a group of U.S. special forces preparing to defend Nikol.

He singled out the propagandists who are ethnic Armenian: Margo Simonyan, Tigran Keosayan, Aram Gabrielyanov, Semyon Baghdasarov, Roman Babayan, Sergey Kurghinyan, and Andranik Mihranyan.

##several trucks brought humanitarian aid to Nagorno-Karabakh

Hundreds of tons of food and other items entered Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia with the support of peacekeepers and Red Cross organizations.

Azerbaijan said it will send 2 trucks with fuel via the Agdam route. Azerbaijan has intentionally cut off the supply of gas and electricity to Nagorno-Karabakh for 10 months in an attempt to make it impossible for ethnic Armenians to live in their homes.

9/21/2023,Currently the future of Armenians of Karabakh is being discussed on AzTV including how Azerbaijan should ensure they live a comfortable life and how they should be provided with proper jobs and infrastructure,,1
10/10/2020,A question on the makeup of the current Nagorno-Karabakh War.,"A lot of the posts and comments talk about the Azeri’s and Armenians fighting and about the destruction that Armenia is suffering from Azeri drones.

However, it was my understanding that the Republic of Artsakh (unrecognized) had its own defense force and while Armenia supplies and supports them, Armenian troops and equipment is not directly involved in the war.  Is this understanding correct? If so, shouldn’t we be distinguishing between Armenia and the ethnic Armenians in Artsakh?

Or are Armenian troops crossing the Azeri border and fighting with the Artsakh Defense Force? I feel like if it was Armenia vs Azerbaijan that the drones wouldn’t have as much free range as Armenia has a more integrated air defense system and similar air defense platforms as the Azeri’s. 

Thanks for the help and no propaganda or nationalist statements please.",1
9/21/2023,Nagorno-Karabakh lays down arms // Peacekeepers killed // Samvel Babayan's plan // Kremlin instructs media to blame Armenia and West: leak // Aliyev's message // Interviews // Kocharyan's audio message to Putin: AI or real?,"##day 2: Azerbaijan attacks Nagorno-Karabakh and civilians; tens of thousands [evacuated](https://youtu.be/NkGfqxI8AyI) so far

[Read the Tuesday coverage here](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16n5kwj/eu_warns_azerbaijan_not_to_cause_exodus_of_ethnic/).

On Wednesday the Azerbaijani army attacked an ambulance vehicle transporting several bodies to a morgue, injuring the driver. 

Casualties: 200 killed (5 children), 400 wounded (15 children). The fate of many civilians is still unknown. People don't have access to basic necessities. Families have been separated.

The battles continued in the frontline for positional control. Nagorno-Karabakh said Azerbaijan was able to capture new positions and roads while sustaining losses.

A 4th-century Armenian monastery Amaras went under Azerbaijani control. It's located in the southeast of the republic.

The city of Martakert (northeast) was evacuated after Azerbaijan targeted civilian infrastructure and captured positions in that direction. Mass evacuations from the Askeran region: [video](https://youtu.be/cwSls56yicU?t=20).

The mayor of Martakert Aznavor Saghyan was killed during an attack last night. Ter Hovhannes Hovhannisyan, an abbot from Dadivank monastery, was injured as a result of the aggression. He is in a hospital.

##... former adviser to the Nagorno-Karabakh government urges the President to make concessions

**BEGLARYAN ARTAK:** The authorities must make a bold and difficult decision very quickly while the public should accept it sensibly. This bloody genocide must be stopped as soon as possible. The losses are piling up while the enemy continues to encroach. 

It's obvious that Russia and the West do not want to stop this. Their criminal silence supports Azerbaijan. //

**Current and former Presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh held a meeting:** The reaction of international actors is inadequate. No practical steps are being taken by them. We will have to make difficult concessions. //

##... Kremlin justifies Azerbaijan's military aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh: ""It's their land"" 

**Putin's spokesman:** We are talking about military operations on the territory of Azerbaijan, recognized by Armenia. The criticism towards our peacekeepers is unjustified. //

Putin's office later joined Azerbaijan and announced that there was no ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh.

##... Russia presents Nagorno-Karabakh a [ceasefire](https://factor.am/690557.html) plan: ""lay down your arms""

Nagorno-Karabakh accepted the ceasefire offer. They will lay down their arms and agree to hold negotiations with Azerbaijan. It will take place on September 21st in the Azerbaijani town of Yevlakh. The topic will be ""Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians' reintegration, rights, and security.""

Under the ceasefire agreement, Russia will seize and remove all the heavy and lightweight military equipment owned by Nagorno-Karabakh's ""10,000-strong army."" Russia will supposedly send the equipment to Azerbaijan *[or Ukraine, who knows, it would be a shame if the defeat of Armenians ends up helping Russia against Ukraine right?]*.

##... Armenia's PM Pashinyan responds to NK-AZ ceasefire agreement 

**PASHINYAN:** An agreement was reached through Russia to establish a ceasefire. Armenia was not involved in preparing the text of this ceasefire agreement between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. 

The ceasefire text mentions armed forces of the ""Republic of Armenia"". We have said many times that the Republic of Armenia finished the withdrawal of its army from Nagorno-Karabakh in August 2021, so it's unclear why that language was used in the ceasefire agreement. 

The fact that this ceasefire agreement even mentions the ""Republic of Armenia"" reaffirms my suspicions raised yesterday, that one of the goals of this attack was to drag Armenia into a major war and deprive it of its independence and sovereignty.

If the Russian peacekeepers made this offer [to disarm the local defense forces], it's logical to assume that from now on, they will FULLY and without any reservations assume the full responsibility for Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians' safety. That means a full set of conditions must be created to ensure the rights of Armenians to safely live in their homes with dignity. Although I must say that we were expecting that to be the case starting in November 2020. //

##... why does the Russian ceasefire document mention the withdrawal of ""Republic of Armenia"" soldiers if they were withdrawn in 2021? || Interview with ex-MP Arman Babajanyan

**BABAJANYAN:** That was not by an error. It was done intentionally by Russia to clear Azerbaijan of wrongdoing for past/present/future aggression. It is a well-known fact that Armenia actually withdrew its conscripts and contractors from Nagorno-Karabakh in 2021. But Azerbaijan maintained the lie to use it against Armenia. Azerbaijan will use this to try to legitimize its aggression in the eyes of the international community, while Russia will try to cause problems in Armenia-West diplomatic cooperation. //

##... ranking member of Armenia's ruling party about pro-Russian political forces in Armenia:

**PAPOYAN GEVORG:** What you see in front of the government building *[hundreds of protesters attacked the building, injured police]* is nothing new. It's the same old tactic: foreign and internal forces jointly attacking Armenia's statehood. Do not fall for the manipulations of the foreign-controlled 5th column. 

##... the chronology of events, by Informed Citizens NGO Daniel Ioannesian 

**IOANNESIAN:** Let's recap the events that unfolded recently.

(1) Pro-Russian/Kocharyan forces come to power in Nagorno-Karabakh.

(2) Azerbaijan launches a large-scale assault, obviously with the permission of Russia judging from the Kremlin's response.

(3) Dmitri Medvedev hints that the Armenian government will be forcefully removed. 

(4) The Russian propaganda machine blames everything on the Armenian government. 

(5) Kocharyan's bolstered pro-Russian forces attack the Armenian government building.

(6) While possessing even more tanks and artillery than Armenia, the pro-Russian/Kocharyan government of Nagorno-Karabakh capitulates within a day.

It's understandable that Russia wants to turn Armenia into Belarus 2.0, but it is sad that some residents of Armenia are willing to join and act against national interests. //

##... Operation Ring 2.0

**ARA HAKOBYAN, politician:** Right now we are losing territories of Nagorno-Karabakh in a similar way that we lost Shahumyan during Operation Ring. Under the watch of Russian soldiers, Azerbaijan is currently removing ethnic Armenians from their lands. 

We had a similar situation during the Sumgayit massacres when Russian soldiers stood by, and once the job was done, they would escort residents out so they could earn the title of savior. The exact same scenario is unfolding today. 

Putin and Erdogan met not long ago in Sochi. They must have reached an agreement to allow this attack. Russia must have secured something in return. Time will tell what Russia's prize is. //

##... ""there was an agreement between Erdogan and Putin"": Valeri Solovei, Russian opposition figure 

**REPORTER:** Why did Azerbaijan conduct its Russian-style ""special military operation"" now? How do you explain the timing?

**SOLOVEI:** The agreement was reached between Erdogan and Putin on September 4th. By the way, that was the only topic they agreed around. Erdogan asked Putin if he would mind an operation against Nagorno-Karabakh and *maybe* Armenia too. Putin gave the green light. This information was leaked immediately. I can verify its authenticity. 

**REPORTER:** Why did Putin take a 180 turn compared to 2020 when he was against Turkish activities in the region?

**SOLOVEI:** First. Just as in 2020, Putin wants Pashinyan gone because he hates anything that resembles a color revolution and democracy.

Second. Russia couldn't resist Turkey today even if it wanted to. Russia depends on Turkey's transit hubs and other partnerships.

Third. Putin no longer gives a crap about anything. He wants to leave chaos behind him. He is proud of the chaos he creates around the world.

**REPORTER:** Armenia's First Lady went to Ukraine with aid, Armenia is ratifying the Rome Statute, and Armenia is hosting U.S. soldiers. The following might be the Kremlin's response: Russian regulator has declared Armenian cognac as an unwanted product on the territory of Russia. The same had happened to Georgian wine. How did this AM-RU conflict start?

**SOLOVEI:** Armenians finally understood that Russia doesn't plan to help them so they began to search for other defense partners. Russia is using that in an attempt to pin the blame on Armenia: *""You abandoned us for the West.""* 

**REPORTER:** How will this end for Nagorno-Karabakh?

**SOLOVEI:** Azerbaijan will assume physical control of Nagorno-Karabakh. A significant portion of ethnic Armenians will leave. Some elements of self-governance will be granted. 

**REPORTER:** How will this end for Pashinyan?

**SOLOVEI:** Unfortunately for the Kremlin, there is still no strong reaction against Pashinyan. The Kremlin was expecting a much stronger wave of anger and a pro-Russian revolution.

Russia should expect the collapse of CSTO. Armenia will certainly exit it soon, followed by Kazakhstan in early 2024. The Kazakh president Tokayev has already informed Putin about their plans to leave CSTO. //

##... leak reveals Putin's plan to instruct its media outlets to blame everything on Pashinyan and the West 

[The leak](https://factor.am/690694.html) was published by the Russian media outlet Meдuza. According to the report, Putin's office sent instructions to its media outlets on September 19. 

They advise them to blame the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh on Armenia and the West. 

The Kremlin also wants the Russian peacekeepers to be portrayed as merely ""observers"" who are assisting in the evacuation of the population.

The Kremlin also wants the Russian Orthodox Church in Nagorno-Karabakh to get credit for housing IDPs. 


##... ex-PM Armen Babajanyan about NK-AZ negotiations || Samvel Babayan's ignored plan 

**BABAJANYAN:** The November 9, 2020, agreement is in the deathbed. Enter Lavrov Plan and the full ""integration"" of Armenians into Azerbaijan. Of course you should not expect Russian peacekeepers to ensure the safety of Armenian civilians. Only residents who are incapable of leaving will stay in Nagorno-Karabakh, giving Russia just enough Armenian presence to maintain its troops in the region.

As Lavrov has stated [in March 2023, months *before* Pashinyan's ""clarification"" of Azerbaijan's 86,600 km² territorial integrity], Russia wants Armenians in Azerbaijan to have the same rights as the Serbs in Kosovo, meaning no rights, no local governing bodies.

That is what Samvel Babayan's critics wanted. They ignored his repeated warnings to hold a meeting with Azerbaijan as soon as possible to negotiate from more dignified positions. I can reveal its content now:

Those documents contained very dignified terms for Nagorno-Karabakh. *At the time*, Azerbaijan agreed to negotiate the formation of essentially an autonomous republic within Azerbaijan with its own small number of guards.

But the [Nagorno-Karabakh authorities] rejected it and Russia eventually dragged them to a full capitulation. Now this will help Russia destabilize Armenia and hijack power in Yerevan. We must be prepared to fight for our statehood. //

##... Gen. Samvel Babayan offered his support to establish a ceasefire and negotiate with Azerbaijan, got rejected again

**HAYK KHANUMYAN, politician:** Yesterday I spoke with President Shahramanyan and conveyed that at this difficult moment, Samvel Babayan is ready to take full responsibility and negotiate with Azerbaijan.

The President agreed to host Babayan. However, presumably under the pressure of Bako Sahakyan and Arkadi Ghukasyan [ex-regime that returned to power] he later changed his mind and rescinded Babayan's invitation. The President said they were in touch with Azerbaijan through Russian mediation to reach a ceasefire agreement. //


##... interview with journalist Tatul Hakobyan 

**REPORTER:** What happened? Why was the government changed in Nagorno-Karabakh? Why did they miss the opportunity to reach a more favorable outcome a month ago?

**TATUL:** Azerbaijan was demanding the removal of heavy equipment from Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia had already withdrawn its army from Nagorno-Karabakh in 2021. Azerbaijan's new demand was the removal of heavy equipment owned by the Nagorno-Karabakh army. There weren't that many to begin with due to the blockade. 

Russia made an offer to Nagorno-Karabakh: Give your equipment to us and you'll maintain something like a national guard consisting of internal forces. That offer was being discussed. *[and the now-former president of Nagorno-Karabakh Arayik Harutyunyan had already agreed to remove the equipment and they even managed to remove dozens of tanks and vehicles before the war, but the process was stopped for reasons unclear]*

**TATUL continues:** Nagorno-Karabakh's new president Shahramanyan discussed Russia's offer to remove the equipment during various internal meetings. There were likely very sharp objections, prompting him to ""go until the end"". They miscalculated. 

**REPORTER:** You and Samvel Babayan had been urging them to go for a compromise.

**TATUL:** Vitali Balasanyan *[NK official who negotiated with Azerbaijan under Arayik administration]* and I had a complicated past but as soon as I learned he was negotiating with Azerbaijan, I was one of the few public figures at the time who praised that decision. We cannot trust Russia, the U.S., or anyone else. The best guarantee for security is holding negotiations with Turks. If you don't, you end up capitulating like this. This is a capitulation.

**REPORTER:** Who is at fault?

**TATUL:** From 1994-1998, the ""traitor"" president LTP was ready to resolve the conflict but the 1998 coup stopped it. The 2020 loss is of course the fault of the current government in Armenia. That's just how it works. But the September 20 capitulation is the fault of the current Nagorno-Karabakh government that came to power a few weeks ago.

The priority right now should be to save the people of Nagorno-Karabakh:

(1) We must discuss the possibility of evacuating NK residents. Anyone who dared to speak about this a month ago was deemed a traitor. Now it's necessary.

(2) Will Russian peacekeepers stay? We only have 2 years left. Ignore Maria Zakharova and Margarita Simonyan and establish good relations with Russia.

(3) If peacekeepers will stay, find out if it'll be possible for ethnic Armenians of NK to continue to live in their homes. No one should be ""forced"" to live there. 

(4) Former leaders of Armenia must speak up and comfort the public. I think LTP predicted this day with 100% accuracy. In 1998 he said, ""We will all answer for leading our people to another catastrophe."" Kocharyan and Serj should speak, too.

(5) When this is all over, it will be time for new elections again. It's necessary after each major event.

**REPORTER:** Why does the ceasefire agreement accuse the Republic of Armenia of having an army in Nagorno-Karabakh when in reality it doesn't?

**TATUL:** That language was added by Russia and Azerbaijan. The latter will undoubtedly try to use it against Armenia during the UNSC session. But I wouldn't hyperfocus on it.

##... interview with Armenian defense official Andranik Kocharyan 

**REPORTER:** Explain the latest events.

**ANDRANIK:** The new government of Nagorno-Karabakh, joined by all previous leaders and other figures, discussed and approved Azerbaijan's ceasefire terms during a meeting with Russian peacekeepers. 

Notably missing from the meeting was Samvel Babayan, who had been urging for months to hold dialogue with Azerbaijan to buy more time for Nagorno-Karabakh *and* Armenia.

**REPORTER:** It wasn't just the Nagorno-Karabakh government. The opposition parties in Armenia were also against meeting Azerbaijan. They considered any dialogue with Azerbaijan as capitulation.

**ANDRANIK:** And that's when Ruben Vardanyan appears in Nagorno-Karabakh and receives a ranking position from President Arayik. His mission was murky. He began advocating for Nagorno-Karabakh to reject anything and everything that connects them to Azerbaijan, any dialogue. Where was Ruben Vardanyan during the ceasefire signing?

**REPORTER:** If we could launch the negotiations a month ago from better positions, why didn't we go for it? Today we have chaos, deaths, and ultimatums.

**ANDRANIK:** Today a thought crossed my mind: the 2020 war ended today during that meeting between Nagorno-Karabakh leaders and Russian peacekeepers. So the question is, why did Arayik resign and sit on that advisory board right next to the new president? Will Arayik testify to the War Commission? 

Because by judging from the events surrounding the 2016, 2020, and 2023 wars, it seems that the strings are being pulled from outside Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The producer of this show has his own interests and plans. If they were going to sign this ceasefire agreement, why didn't they do so months ago that would have granted the Armenian side a stronger role in the process?

**REPORTER:** Where are the puppet masters?

**ANDRANIK:** [Russia]. Their puppets have just been activated in Armenia.

**REPORTER:** [asks about the efforts to strengthen Armenia's army]

**ANDRANIK:** We are building fortifications that should have been built 20 years ago. Within 5 months we created reinforced regions without publicly advertising it. 

**REPORTER:** What are those?

**ANDRANIK:** Engineering structures that will allow us to defend our borders with minimal human losses. 

**REPORTER:** We have been building new fortifications?

**ANDRANIK:** Yes.

**REPORTER:** What are they?

**ANDRANIK:** Structures that strong and developed countries like France and Germany build.

**REPORTER:** Where are they?

**ANDRANIK:** On borders. Especially on the second line of defense. These second lines didn't even *exist* until now. In Nagorno-Karabakh, I think they managed to build just a single similar structure right before the 2020 war. We sustained 0 deaths and 0 wounded in that location. It was done by Gen. Grigoryan, the same guy in charge of our engineering forces today. 

##... EU and France call on Azerbaijan to ensure dignified treatment for Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh 

**CHARLES MICHEL:** This morning, I called on President Aliyev to ensure a complete cease-fire and a safe, dignified treatment of Karabakh Armenians by Azerbaijan. Human rights and security must be ensured. //



##... Azerbaijani president ""recognizes Armenia's territorial integrity"", cites Azeri army losses and ""mission already accomplished"" for agreeing to the ceasefire with Nagorno-Karabakh

**ALIYEV:** They unexpectedly demonstrated political competence. We appreciate it and consider it an important step. These events will have a positive impact on the peace process. This will create long-term peace in the South Caucasus. Armenia should feel confident that we do not have eyes on Armenian lands. Azerbaijan recognizes the territorial integrity of Armenia. We would have gone until the end had they not lay down their arms in Karabakh. However, our military also has losses. The Armenian population of Karabakh are citizens of Azerbaijan. We want to coexist with peace based on mutual respect and mutual understanding. //

##... peacekeepers were ambushed and killed in Nagorno-Karabakh in a territory controlled by Russians and Azeris 

Russia's MOD revealed that one of the peacekeeping vehicles was returning from its observation point when it was ambushed by rifle fire. Everyone in the vehicle was killed. Russian and Azerbaijani authorities are conducting a joint investigation.

While making no mention of the attackers' identity, Russia's foreign ministry chose to trashtalk ""ungrateful"" critics instead:

MARIA ZAKHAROVA: ""Նրանք [peacekeepers] զոհվել են հանուն տարածաշրջանում խաղաղության։ Ապերախտությունը, որով ոչ մաքրասեր մարդիկ փորձեցին կասկածի տակ դնել նրանց գործունեությունը, չի ստվերի ընկածների սխրանքը, այլ կդառնա զրպարտիչների հավերժ խարանը"" //

##... Kocharyan allegedly sent an audio message to Putin revealing their post-2018 plan || Kocharyan says the audio is an AI fake 

[Here is the audio](https://youtu.be/C26UzTNgAxE?t=276). The breathing and pauses make it sound authentic although I'm not an AI expert. Can the AI replicate a high-quality speech in the *Armenian* language? This is what the voice says:

**VOICE:** Since my [re]entry into politics in 2018 and the active resistance to the current government took place under our mutual agreement [with Putin], I'd like to ask you to ensure my planned exit from this situation. Living and working here in Armenia like a hostage while having a constant target on my back is unacceptable. Your opinion has a decisive power here. I'm not in the position to go against your will so I'd like to ask you to secure my planned exist from this situation. //

Kochayan believes the ""AI fake"" audio is a preemptive political strike meant to harm his future activities. He said his last phone call with Putin was in 2021 but did not deny sending this as a pre-recorded message afterward. 
If the audio is real, it is still unclear whether it's new or it was recorded in 2019-2020 while he was in/facing jail.

**REUTERS:** There is an EU diplomatic service paper prepared by the European External Action Service.

It states that the EU could gradually reconsider political engagement, financial assistance, and sectoral cooperation with Azerbaijan after the events in Nagorno-Karabakh.

The document reflects a balance of different positions of member states. Some countries wanted more [tougher stance on Azerbaijan], while others didn't want anything at all.

Pro-Armenian: France, Germany, Netherlands.

Pro-Azerbaijan: Hungary, Austria.

The EU might not be able to sanction Azerbaijan, but it could instead support Armenia economically and possibly militarily.

The EU is considering ""political and economic actions to further support the democratically elected authorities of Armenia, including in the area of security and resilience, and the continuation of the democratic reforms.""

##from Tuesday: France will deliver military equipment to Armenia

##Azerbaijani president will skip the Western-backed negotiations in Granada

There was supposed to be an AM-AZ meeting on the sidelines of the European Political Community’s gathering. Leaders of various states are expected to visit Granada.

The AM-AZ meeting was going to be hosted by France, Germany, and the EU.

Ilham Aliyev rejected the meeting because of France's pro-Armenian stance and Germany’s disagreement on Turkey's participation in the AM-AZ meeting.

Turkey's President Erdogan later announced he would not attend the Granada summit at all because of ""health reasons"".

##interview with military analyst Leonid Nersisyan

**LEONID:** Not the first time Azerbaijan boycotts a Western platform because of France. Last time they found a way to address the disagreements. But we should not rule out a military aggression by Azerbaijan by the end of this month, before the snowy season.

**REPORTER:** Why do you often refer to Russia as an ""ally"" in quotation marks?

**LEONID:** No one has doubts that the Nagorno-Karabakh leaders were strongly pro-Russian. Russian peacekeepers could have easily evacuated them with their helicopters but they chose to allow Azerbaijan to arrest the leaders. Somehow Russia always keeps its promises towards Azerbaijan, but can't do that for Armenia. ""Rossiya svoix ~~ne~~ brosayet."" [Russia ~~does not abandon~~ abandons its allies.]

**REPORTER:** What weapons can France deliver to Armenia?

**LEONID:** Expensive but good quality weapons. For example, the French air defense is better than India's. But even something like opening the access to the French market of components could be a huge boost for Armenia. Installing French optics, engine, or laser tech on Armenian drones could drastically improve them.

Establishing ties with France could also simplify negotiations with other European countries. It'll be easier to deal with Europe than with the U.S.

**REPORTER:** How would this compare to Russian weapons?

**LEONID:** Comparing is pointless because Russian weapon isn't available anymore. Russian weapons have been traditionally viewed as a good bang for the buck [no pun intended]. Armenia is replacing them with Indian weapons. When it comes to expensive but definitely tested and higher-quality weapons, the West is where you can find them. Armenia should be selective and only buy from the West what India cannot provide.

**REPORTER:** Could the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army soldiers join the Armenian army?

**LEONID:** Yes. They could form a brigade or a division made of NK DA personnel who already know each other. Their performance on September 19 was not bad despite the capitulation. The Azeri army sustained over 700 casualties in a single day *[officially confirmed: >200 dead, >500 wounded]*. Obviously, the NK army could not have won because they were encircled and under a blockade.

**REPORTER:** Will Armenia leave the CSTO?

**LEONID:** Armenia's actions to establish closer ties to the West could eventually lead to the freezing of its relations with CSTO, similar to Uzbekistan. Why leave it officially if you can have a similar effect without further angering Russia, especially since I haven't heard of any alternative offers made to Armenia?

##Russan peacekeepers are patrolling the empty streets of Stepanakert: VIDEO

October is traditionally a national holiday month in Nagorno-Karabakh. Families travel to Armenia for a vacation. The streets and shops are empty.

[video](https://youtu.be/gWNP0iN8ttY)



##Q: Is there a point in keeping Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh until 2025?

**FOREIGN MINISTRY OF RUSSIA:** We will analyze the situation on the ground with our Azeri colleagues and make a joint decision.

##U.S. responds to Armenia's ratification of Rome Statute 

**STATE DEPT:** We respect Armenia’s sovereignty and independence, and we’ll leave it to Armenia’s Government to comment on its legislative processes. We have been encouraged by many states, including Armenia, that have undertaken commitments to promote justice and accountability.

**REPORTER:** We have seen increasing rhetoric coming out of Russia, threatening Armenia for the very step it has taken. Will the U.S. step up and defend Armenia against potential Russian aggression, either directly through its army or through its proxy forces, like there are reports about Wagner being present?

**STATE DEPT:** That is quite the hypothetical. I don’t want to get into it. What I will say, though, is that the U.S. is going to continue to play a role in engaging with Azerbaijani and Armenian leadership at the highest levels to pursue a dignified and durable peace.

We reiterate our call for a longer-term, independent, international monitoring mission in Nagorno-Karabakh to provide transparency and reassurances that the rights and securities of ethnic Armenians will be protected. //

##who is the representative (commandant) of Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh?

Azeri media writes that Sargis Galstyan has been appointed as Baku's representative in Nagorno-Karabakh. Galstyan is the uncle of a Nagorno-Karabakh Parliament MP representing a party run by the former regime (now the new regime).

**Galstyan's nephew (MP):** I cannot confirm or deny the report. We saw him last time on September 28th. He said he'd remain in Nagorno-Karabakh to take care of others. //

Sargis Galstyan is a relative of Bako Sahakyan, the former president of Nagorno-Karabakh. He held various government positions in the past. He was the manager of the ""Avan Shushi Plaza"" hotel in Shushi.

##the West secretly sought help from Russia to open the Lachin corridor, days before Azerbaijan's aggression

**POLITICO:** The meeting was a rare sign of diplomacy between Putin and the West on a high-level security topic, while regular ties have been upended by war.

The meeting took place on September 17 in Istanbul as part of efforts to pressure Azerbaijan to end its nine-month blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh. The meeting focused on “how to get the bloody trucks moving”.

The meeting took place between Louis Bono (US), Toivo Klaar (EU), and  Igor Khovaev (RU). Such high-level diplomatic interaction is rare. 

An EU official said, “we believe it is important to maintain channels of communications with relevant interlocutors to avoid misunderstandings.”  Klaar had sought to keep lines open on numerous fronts over the “past years,” including in talks with Khovaev and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.

A U.S. official said, “We need to be able to work with the Russians on this because they do have influence over the parties."" //

The meeting was followed by the entry of a few trucks into Nagorno-Karabakh. A day later Azerbaijan attacked.

**Foreign Ministry of Russia:** The US and EU asked us to hold a meeting to discuss the situation. We exchanged our positions. //

##interview with analyst Karen Sargsyan \\ AM-FR relations \\ Kidnapping of Nagorno-Karabakh leaders 

**REPORTER:** What weapons should we expect from France: Optical devices, vests, and similar things, or heavier weapons?

**KAREN:** We should not discuss this openly right now.

**REPORTER:** Could they arrive by the end of this year?

**KAREN:** Yes.

**REPORTER:** France did not demand Armenia to formally exit the CSTO as a precondition, according to FM Mirzoyan. 

**KAREN:** They never make demands but you have to read between the lines and understand the offer. The only ones making ""demands"" are the horses hooked on cocaine, like Sergey Lavrov.

**REPORTER:** How do you explain the recent high-profile visits by U.S. and French officials?

**KAREN:** Azerbaijan broke the promise not to attack Nagorno-Karabakh. It's an insult to the West. Aliyev and its backers will eventually pay for it. 2) They view Armenia as the eastern border of Europe and part of European civilization. 3) They need a Suez 2.0 route connecting Armenia, Iran, and India. 4) They don't want Big Turan and rising Russian influence over communication routes.

**REPORTER:** France has asked the EU to increase the number of border observers and to expand their legal mandate. What can you tell us about it?

**KAREN:** The technical details aren't clear yet. So far there is a political decision by France. Germany will likely join them. If it's an EU-level initiative, it might pass if Aliyev's girlfriend Viktor Orban doesn't block it.

**REPORTER:** Will Azerbaijan attempt to promote the ""Zangezur corridor"" during the Granada meeting?

**KAREN:** Syunem that corridor. It's a dead topic that appears only in Russia's wet dreams. Even Turkey is giving up on it [and choosing a route via Iran instead]. This reaffirms the suspicions that Russia was the main backer of this corridor. It was drafted and promoted primarily by Russia. 

**REPORTER:** Is the Nov. 9 document irrelevant now?

**KAREN:** The Nov. 9 Statement has never held a legal power and has never been ratified anywhere. Everything that took place after the signing of that Statement was based on the decisions made by state leaders. Nagorno-Karabakh leadership agreed to a ceasefire under those conditions and with the personal reassurances of Vladimir Vladimirich Putin, whose word they believed 4 times stronger than Jesus's, which is why they have been crucified. They ignored Russia's surrender of their territories to Azerbaijan after the ceasefire, the surrender of Berdzor, Parukh, and Aghavno. They instead held a sign reading *""Thank you Russia!""*.

**REPORTER:** Why didn't the West prevent the attack on Nagorno-Karabakh?

**KAREN:** Because Nagorno-Karabakh leaders were Russian puppets and had no moral right to demand or expect anything from the West, with the exception of begging for food. The politicians who adopted the Spasiba Rossiya, spasiba Putin, May 9 hurrah, ""Z"" and other garbage should have demanded things from Russia instead, not the West. Why would the West help Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, when the former has provided military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, while the latter intentionally positioned itself in the Russian camp? Didn't the government of Nagorno-Karabakh congratulate Russia on the annexation of Donbas? Did they think they could get away with this? 

How many times did the West invite Nagorno-Karabakh leadership to take part in Western-led negotiations? *[The U.S. offered its mediation. Russia did not want Nagorno-Karabakh to accept it. Russia leaked the information about that offer and claimed it was a ""blackmail"" by the West to discredit it. Nagorno-Karabakh leadership turned down the first offer under Russian pressure.]*

3 Dec 2022: Azerbaijan shuts down the Lachin corridor.

4 Dec 2022: The corridor is open again, but briefly.

7 Dec 2022: President Arayik leaves Nagorno-Karabakh and visits France. Russia is concerned over Arayik-West relations.

12 Dec 2022: Russia and Azerbaijan close the Lachin after Arayik's return. He is ""locked up"" from that point on. 

**REPORTER:** How did the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh get arrested by Azerbaijani police yesterday?

**KAREN:** They were arrested in Ivanyan, which means Russian peacekeepers likely handed them over [there is a Russian base in Ivanyan, that's where NK-RU-AZ negotiations often take place]. From what I've heard, they went to Ivanyan to take a Russian helicopter to reach Armenia. Idiots trusted Russia again. 

**REPORTER:** Why has Azerbaijan arrested all the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh? 

**KAREN:** Aliyev wants to sentence them to prison before issuing an amnesty to show the international community how ""kind"" he is. He views it as a tool to ease the criticism. This could backfire because international actors have met many of these arrested individuals and view them as diplomatic figures who should not have been arrested to begin with. If you want to arrest political figures, you have to take them to the Hague.

**REPORTER:** Who is Sargis Galstyan, Azerbaijan's ""commandant"" in Nagorno-Karabakh? Reports suggest he is a close associate of ex-president Bako Sahakyan from anti-Pashinyan circles. 

**KAREN:** His background suggests he was formerly engaged in civic society activities to bring peace between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. But he is undoubtedly an agent of a foreign state [Russia]. 

**REPORTER:** Isn't there a risk he might provide sensitive information to Azerbaijani authorities? 

**KAREN:** Every one of the arrested officials could. The more the society calls itself patriotic, speaks against women who color their hair, and rejects Western values, the more idiotic that society is, and the easier it is to manipulate it. It's easier for a foreign agent to infiltrate these types of societies because all the agent has to do to become trusted is to suggest that women should not wear short skirts. We've seen a lot of degenerates, we've gone through the 2020 war. What do these collaborators deserve? Can't say it out loud, but you know exactly what.

**REPORTER:** Commandant Galstyan's relative worked as a journalist in Armenia and repeatedly targeted the more or less reasonable officials from Nagorno-Karabakh, and also spread anti-Western and anti-George Soros propaganda in Armenia. 

**KAREN:** Regarding the collaborators in the Nagorno-Karabakh government who signed the capitulation. Their properties should be confiscated in Armenia. If they disclose any state secrets while under arrest in Baku, they better stay in Azerbaijan and serve their time there. 

Nagorno-Karabakh residents' mistake was trusting Russia. 

**REPORTER:** But you can tell that refugees are anti-Russian now.

**KAREN:** I'm not sure yet. It will take time for people to admit they were wrong. They need to live and work for 3-5 years without heavy stress in order to rehabilitate and start making decisions. 

Nagorno-Karabakh's government miscalculated in 2018. After the Armenian revolution of 2018 and the anti-Armenian rhetoric adopted by the Russian media, the government of Nagorno-Karabakh decided to ignore Armenia and speak directly with Russia. 

**REPORTER:** Why?

**KAREN:** Because for many years a lie was spread and solidified in Nagorno-Karabakh claiming that Armenia did not help Nagorno-Karabakh win the 1st war and that they won only thanks to Russia. The mother of the motherfucker who spread that narrative deserves to be nailed against a wall. 

**REPORTER:** The pro-Russian opposition in Armenia cheered the forced removal of President Arayik Harutyunyan, lauding Russia as a true ally of Nagorno-Karabakh. The latest lie is that Arayik left voluntarily. He did not. They quickly forgot how Tatar Rubo made a big scene from the church's backyard, criticizing Arayik for refusing to resign. This coup was a self-inflicted wound. Today they are engaged in the heroization of Rubo on the streets of Yerevan.

**KAREN:** Speaking of Tatar Rubo. The real motive behind his arrest could be his business background in Russia. [Pro-Kremlin Azeri businessman] God Nisanov would love to corner Rubo and extract things from him. Rubo has a foundation in Switzerland tasked with the education of children of Russian oligarchs. This is a serious business. They might go after it.

Rubo's business was somewhat on the decline. Morgan Stanley offered him $16 billion for his Troika Dialogue business in 2007. He turned down the offer. A year later he sold it to Russian Sberbank for only $0.9 billion. 

**REPORTER:** What will the ratification of the Rome Statute give Armenia?

**KAREN:** Normally the UN expresses ""concerns"" but doesn't act. The ICC was created so that in rare and severe instances, when a ""concern"" isn't enough, they can refer the case to the ICC to take action. There are two main courts: the World Court and ICC. The ICC is where they tried Milosevic.  

**REPORTER:** When asked why she refrained from describing the events in Nagorno-Karabakh as ""ethnic cleansing"", the French FM basically responded by urging Armenia to present the evidence to the ICC, now that we have ratified it. Could the Rome Statute restrain Ilham Aliyev?

**KAREN:** No, not Aliyev personally. The president of Rwanda, the organizer of the genocide, was not ""found"". But this will have an impact on the Azerbaijani ruling class in general. It's difficult to sanction the leader himself, but the lower-ranking officials and army leaders could easily find themselves on wanted lists. Moreover, they understand that Aliyev wouldn't hesitate to throw them under the bus. There have already been criminal cases and purges in the Azeri army for unrelated reasons. 

**REPORTER:** What's going on with the church leadership in Armenia?

**KAREN:** Armenians love symbolism. If you spot an Armenian in an open field and install a door in front of him, he will stand in front of the door forever. Armenians love pointless symbols. Who is this Catholicos if not an idiot and a serial candle merchant? He summoned archbishops and urged them to [join the pro-Russian political forces to help remove Pashinyan]. We know who Catholicos's brother is and how he made his fortune. 

Azeris toppled the giant metal cross in Stepanakert. The internet was engulfed in a big vaynasun and grief. You look at the amount of metal wasted on it and realize how many frontline positions they could have reinforced with it. Was building that cross more important?

Vaay vooy babo dedo sculpture will be destroyed next. ""How can it be, we took photos under it!"" There is too much symbolism and not enough substance in the Armenian mentality. People have to see something in order to value it and identify with it. This is why I was pissed when Vahan Kerobyan decided to help Gagik Tsarukyan build the statue of Christ. Why don't you build a factory instead? Why don't you donate it to the state so they can buy more weapons?

##Russia has a new player in Armenia's internal politics 

The former deputy army commander and MOD Arshak Karapetyan promises to be a serious political force in Armenia.

He dedicated a quarter of his intro speech to praising Russia, another quarter to reminding you how awful Nikol is, another quarter to complain about getting fired by Nikol, and the remaining quarter to praise his army management skills.

He was fired in 2016 by Serj Sargsyan after the army's failures during the 2016 April war. He was re-appointed and then replaced by Nikol in 2021 after the army's failures on the AM-AZ border.

He was also tasked with gathering intel data for the army.

##Pashinyan appoints the first head of Armenia's newly established Foreign Intelligence Service

After the 2020 war, the government decided to create a new foreign intel service amid shortcomings of the traditionally Russian-friendly NSS service and the army's intel wing.

##... who is Kristine Grigoryan, the first head of the agency?

2004-2014: Legal specialist at Parliament, assistant to MPs.

2014-2015: Led a team as part of the USAID-funded program ""Support to the Development of Institutional Capacities of the Parliament""

2016: National human rights expert at the Council of Europe (later as Human Rights Ombudsman under Pashinyan admin.)

2018: Adviser to Ararat Mirzoyan (now FM)

2019: Deputy Justice Minister 

##... about the Foreign Intelligence Service

**REPORTER:** This appointment marks the inception of the FIS. What functions will the service carry out?

**PASHINYAN OFFICE:** The FIS will predict foreign threats and provide political decision-makers with relevant reliable intelligence data. 
The FIS will closely cooperate with actors inside and outside of Armenia to strengthen the independence and sovereignty of Armenia. 

**REPORTER:** Why is it launching now?

**PASHINYAN OFFICE:** It's part of the Government's plan to reform the security sector. The plan was approved in December 2022.

**REPORTER:** Which country's service model was chosen as the foundation of the service?

**PASHINYAN OFFICE:** In our discussions, we were guided exclusively by the principles of assessing the security challenges and foreign intelligence needs of Armenia and developing a modern foreign intelligence service quintessential to a democratic society.

##Q&A with PM Pashinyan in Parliament 

**Pro-Russian opposition MP:** You abandoned Nagorno-Karabakh and allowed it to be attacked. You claim the attack was a result of the internal political changes in Nagorno-Karabakh. You are the puppet of Azerbaijan.

**PASHINYAN:** I'm not going to get lectured by your puppet political party about being someone's puppet. You couldn't even sneeze without permission. 

I wouldn't like to speak about my Nagorno-Karabakh colleagues right now, many of whom have been illegally arrested, but I must mention that your faction put a target on Nagorno-Karabakh's back. We remember how you celebrated the ousting of the Nagorno-Karabakh government. You described the process as the people of Nagorno-Karabakh slamming their fists on the table and finally forming a national government. You congratulated this process and stated that the ""time has come to save Nagorno-Karabakh"". 

Everything went according to your plan. ""Look what's going to happen now,"" you said from this podium. What happened is exactly what you planned, but only partially. Your main plan was to drag Armenia into a major war so [Armenia would lose territories and] the Nagorno-Karabakh refugees couldn't even live in Yerevan, so they'd be forced to move straight to Los Angeles and Paris to fill the thinning ranks of ARF. That is your policy. Do not lecture us now. 

##... about Granada meeting

**Ruling MP:** You are going to meet Aliyev in Granada tomorrow. What are the expectations?

**PASHINYAN:** We had high expectations and hoped to sign an important document. This is the document that the opposition presented as ""treason"". They even wanted to block the airport to prevent me from signing it. 

The opposition's efforts failed, and we maintained our strong will, but sadly Azerbaijan has canceled the meeting. Let's record the following: the puppet opposition won't get their bonus paychecks because it wasn't them who derailed this meeting. 

But we will still be present in Granada. We will present our stance. Hopefully, we will sign a document ASAP. Sadly it won't happen tomorrow.

**MP:** Does this destroy the narrative that the [Western-hosted] negotiations are anti-Armenian? Otherwise, why would Azerbaijan reject it?

**PASHINYAN:** The document is neither anti-Azerbaijan nor anti-Armenian. It must be balanced so both sides can sign it. However the problem is that certain foreign forces see an opportunity to use marginalized puppets to derail these efforts.

##... the peace agreement 

**MP:** Were you hoping/planning to sign any document in Granada?

**PASHINYAN:** We need the following: 1) AM and AZ recognize one another's territorial integrity with a specific km^2 number. 2) Alma-Ata Declaration and the 1975 or some newer maps are used for demarcating borders. 3) Regional trade routes open without violating the host states' sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The aforementioned 3 principles cover 70% of the peace agreement. This 70% is the hardest part. Azerbaijan keeps rejecting those principles. I'm ready to sign that document right at this moment. This is what we were supposed to discuss in Granada.

##... ""lowering the bar"" for Nagorno-Karabakh's status was a joint strategy between Yerevan and Stepanakert: Pashinyan  

**PASHINYAN:** I couldn't answer the question about ""lowering the bar"" earlier for objective reasons. I'll reveal the details now, although I still have doubts whether this is a good idea, but the public deserves to know.

Yes, we lowered the bar, and here is the secret: it was done with the knowledge of our Nagorno-Karabakh colleagues and with a prior agreement. 

But here is what happened instead: we lowered the bar but Nagorno-Karabakh proceeded to increase the bar [nothing less than full de jure independence]. They did so under the pressure of your faction [opposition parties in Armenia].

Had the Nagorno-Karabakh government followed our pre-approved plan, it wouldn't end like this. We were headed towards achieving the consolidation of the international community's support. 

You know very well what happened. [The West] offered Nagorno-Karabakh to meet Azerbaijan. Why did they reject it? Don't we want to know? Because someone PREVENTED Nagorno-Karabakh from accepting the [Western] offer. Who prohibited them? Everyone pretends they don't know [sarcastic smile]. //

##Pashinyan about the Nagorno Karabakh negotiation process and the ""diplomatic disaster"" of 2016:

Throughout the negotiation process, NK has never been viewed as a territory where only Armenians would live. The issue of the Azeri population has been part of the negotiations. 

The referendum was never going to be held according to our liking, but even if it were, NK's Azeri population would also take part. Now the question is, would the Azeris of NK, in their turn, be allowed to [break away from NK via a similar process]. What would happen if that question was raised? These are not abstract questions. It's based on the nuances of what was on the negotiation table, which has never been discussed in public.

Today we hear voices, thoughts, and cherrypicked sentences that, in fact, have nothing to do with the package of negotiations that we had as of 2018.

&nbsp;

3 packages were offered in 2016, and for the first time since 2011, NK's interim status was not part of it. Sure, NK would have a legislature, judiciary, etc. But no one is mentioning that the issue of clarifying NK's interim status, according to that negotiation logic, was transferred to the UN Security Council. What is the problem with that?

Throughout the entire negotiation process, Armenia attempted to keep the final resolution within the OSCE Minsk Group framework. In 2016 the parameters to solve the issue were transferred to the UN Security Council. 

Pay attention to Levon Ter-Petrosyan's 2017 interview to H1. He mentions that the international community will decide NK's status. 

[What decision would the UN Security Council make?] The question is, part of which country will NK remain before its final status is resolved? When it's the UN Security Council handling it, the outcome is very predictable, because in 1993 they adopted a resolution stating that NK is part of Azerbaijan and that they recognize Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. 

This is the 2016 disaster. Under this logic, NK's final resolution must be handled per the Azerbaijani constitution. 

**Reporter:** NK has never been part of independent Azerbaijan. Are you saying the UN Security Council accepts NK as part of Azerbaijan? 

**Pashinyan:** Yes. The documents are open for everyone to read.

**Reporter:** what happened between 2016-2018, and after 2018?

**Pashinyan:** Serj Sargsyan revealed that the negotiation process didn't inspire hope, more specifically it had been suspended, because Azerbaijan's expectations were unrealistic and unacceptable for us. 

**Reporter:** is the issue about UN Security Council still on the table?

**Pashinyan:** there are OSCE meetings to continue the negotiations. After the war, we must develop an agenda. Co-chairs proposed one that is acceptable to us. 

##Pashinyan about 2011-2016 process getting progressively worse for Armenia:

Kazan documents were quite good for us, and they included an interim status for NK. Armenia went to sign it. Azerbaijan refused, and started purchasing lots of weapons instead. 

In 2013 Azerbaijan escalates the conflict. In 2014 the conflict deepens. We start to see the first signs of OSCE pressuring Armenia to reject interim status for NK, but Armenia refuses. Military clashes get worse in 2015. 

**And in January of 2016**, OSCE officially present a new package to Armenia, which officially excludes NK's interim status. This was January. Armenia refuses. The war begins in April. OSCE makes a similar proposal in July. Armenia rejects again. In August the OSCE presents a new and disastrous document about the UN Security Council that I spoke about. 

&nbsp;

Serj could have avoided the 2016 war had he at least responded with a more flexible *""okay I'll think about it""* when pressured about removing NK's interim status in January. They had experienced diplomats. 

After the April 2016 war, an event was held in Sayat Nova (Ararat) dedicated to disabled people. I was invited. Arkadiy Ter-Tadevosyan (General Komandos) was also there. I offered him a ride to Yerevan. During the trip, I asked for his opinion as an army expert about the 2016 war. He believed it wasn't a real war but rather a ""test"" before a big war. 

Serj could have stopped the war in 2016 under the same conditions that I was facing in 2020. 

Serj was offered a better deal, actually. If you compare January 2016 *(no interim)* to August 2016 *(no interim, plus UN Sec Con.)*, he had a better deal in front of him. But it was dragged to the point that Serj declared that the negotiation process was suspended because Azerbaijan's stance was unacceptable for us.

Could I stop the war? Yes, by accepting whatever Serj referred to as ""unacceptable for Armenia"". 

This is a legitimate complaint against me. In hindsight, I should have analyzed the situation and told the public that we needed to make all those concessions. But I wasn't sure at that time that that would be the right decision, because the army at the time was reporting that we would be capable of standing our ground per ""not one inch back"" principle. Had I known, I would have handled it differently. The same about 2016. Serj could have prevented the war. //

##Pashinyan: there won't be any communication route without border checks and customs procedures

**Pashinyan:** under no circumstances will Armenia agree to provide a road to Azerbaijan without customs inspections and customs duty. In Sochi and Brussels, we agreed to build railways. 

Publicly voiced positions are the tip of the iceberg, but there are other reasons and issues behind our positions. Aliyev and I tried to delve deeper into the issue. I saw some opportunities for reaching agreements here as well. But we do not have any agreement on this, I just saw some opportunities after that meeting, we should try to use the opportunities to find a real compromise solution to this issue, which does not cross the red lines I have already mentioned about the [vehicle highway] roads.

The road that Azerbaijan gains to Nakhijevan isn't just for Azerbaijan. We view it as an international cargo route. It has to be appealing to international players so it can bring revenues to Armenia. We need not only North-South but also East-West. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071651.html
https://youtu.be/cSLL1Co4txw


##Pashinyan about the safety of cargo transfers:

If Armenian cargo doesn't travel through Azerbaijan, the Azeri cargo won't travel through Armenia. There won't be transfers without security measures. 

It won't make sense to build a railway and not use it. Why would you make large investments? *[Railway is expected to cost very approximately $1B for Azerbaijan and $200M for Armenia.]*

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071654.html


##Pashinyan about a possible peace agreement with Azerbaijan:

Armenia is interested in signing a peace treaty. OSCE Minsk Group recently proposed a Karabakh negotiation agenda, one of the points of which was the issue of a peaceful and comprehensive settlement. We have never and will never refuse to discuss that.

You cannot open a peaceful era without a peace agreement. We need a comprehensive resolution. The purpose of negotiations is to eventually have a peace agreement.

There is propaganda and constant attempts to create the impression that the Armenian government is against border demarcation and delimitation. Armenia supports a peace agreement and a comprehensive resolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071656.html



##Pashinyan about Azerbaijan's possible membership in EAEU trade bloc:

*[Will Armenia veto?]*

If we see a general normalization of relations, it is a topic that we will take seriously. Our stance will depend on our conversation. If it is a step that will contribute to peaceful era, settlement of Artsakh issue, the possibility of compromises, etc. The EAEU membership topic is in the general context of these issues. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071657.html


##Pashinyan about the results of the first 3+2 platform meeting in Moscow:

It left a positive impression. They discussed technical and organizational issues on how often to meet, what to discuss, etc. The 3+2 corresponds to our position that Armenia wants to participate in regional talks.

If we already hold talks with Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan, and will soon hold talks with Turkey separately, it wouldn't make sense not to talk within 3+2. So far we have an understanding that 3+2 won't be used to discuss topics that are already being discussed as part of other platforms [i.e. OSCE for Karabakh]. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071659.html


##Pashinyan about relations with Turkey & Azerbaijan:

Unreasonable optimism should not be expressed over discussions with Turkey and Azerbaijan, as there is no basis for that optimism, but the parties express a desire to discuss, talk, try to create a basis for optimism. We are ready to pursue that path.

Armenia and Turkey have appointed special envoys. The first meeting has not been scheduled yet, but I hope it will take place soon. There are talks about reopening air and railway communication. Our expectation is the normalization of relations but this is a complex and sensitive problem. The emotions are high in Armenia.

We are ready to normalize relations without preconditions. The recognition of the Armenian Genocide has never been a precondition for normalizing relations and opening borders. Our stance remains the same regarding the issue of international recognition of the Genocide.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071660.html


##Pashinyan about a need to reroute Kirants-Voskepar Tavush road after border demarcation:

*[It's about a section that's similar to the southern Syunik road that was recently replaced with a new road that doesn't cross the border.]* 

We are discussing which maps to use for the border delimitation. We are meticulously examining maps from different years to see where our roads cross the border. We are examining various scenarios.

For example, per the 1975 map, 90% of Berkaber village's arable lands are currently under Azeri control. A very large part of Vazashen village land is under Azeri control since the 1990s. Most of Paravakar's arable lands are also under Azeri control.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071662.html


##Pashinyan believes the Armenia-Azerbaijan enclaves were formed ""illegally""

**Pashinyan:** we have not found a legal basis for the existence of enclaves. In my previous interviews, I spoke about what a ""map"" is. You can draw anything, but it has to have a legal basis. We have already studied all the possible documents in the past year. So far we haven't found a legal basis for them.

*[Pashinyan earlier said they are discussing the possibility of each country keeping the ""enclaves"" that are in its territory.]*

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071663.html


##Pashinyan about returning two Azeri soldiers ""without anything in return"":

Armenia is not ""dealing"" with people. Armenia demonstrated full adherence to international norms by returning two border-crossing Azeris.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071652.html

##Pashinyan and Aliyev will meet on December 28

**Pashinyan:** there will be contact with Aliyev during the December 28 CIS conference in St. Petersbourg. It's not an official two-way meeting, but there will be contact.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071653.html


##Pashinyan about Parliamentary vs Presidential system:

President Armen Sarkissian believes that Armenia should switch to a presidential system, but I believe that Parliamentary is better. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1071666.html


##Pashinyan about the politicization of university leadership:

Events in 2020 proved that we did not ""hijack"" universities with our party members. But it turns out that 90% of universities were secretly already politicized. 

During the most difficult times for our state, the universities threw themselves into the arms of the former regime, thinking that our government will soon collapse and they could return to the 2000s.

Today, when MOD Suren Papikyan is the chairman of the YSU council, he is there to ensure the non-partisanship of universities. Many people were given a chance to change but did not use it. We are entering university councils to ensure the principle of non-partisanship.

Diplomats also stabbed us in the back during the crucial time. They gave me written reports around topics, then publicly claimed they were unaware of those topics while holding the opposition's flag during the June elections.

##anti-corruption: former mayor of Armavir is found guilty of voter bribery to help Serj-Vanetsyan alliance in June 20 elections

**Prosecutors report:** PU alliance ballot's #16 candidate was the former Armavir mayor R. Khlghatyan. He reached an agreement with a resident to distribute bribes to over 147 residents to help the PU alliance.

The ex-mayor went to the accomplice's home and gave him ֏9M to be distributed as a bribe. The house was raided by police during the transaction. *[NSO cough Pegasus cough]*

The ex-mayor and his accomplice plead guilty. We decided to downgrade their arrest to bail. 

The court gave a guilty verdict on Thursday. They were sentenced to 4 years, but it was replaced with 5-year probation.

The ֏9M bribe money was confiscated and deposited to state coffers. //

##Diaspora Office chief Sinanyan details the efforts to repatriate Armenian experts, and programs to make diasporans play a more active role:

**database of volunteer experts**

A database was created as part of a program to map the diaspora's potential. It includes the names of those who can contribute to the development of various sectors in Armenia. For years we've wondered what diaspora's true potential is. This program aims to answer that questions.

**iGorts hires diasporans to help the government**

50 experts arrived to volunteer in 2020. Over half of them have repatriated. 14 got a permanent job in state offices, including in management positions. Examples are the director of the National Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, a deputy Economy Minister, organizers of Expo 2020 Dubai, etc. Another diasporan has moved to Artsakh and founded the ""Hub Artsakh"" organization.

Another 50 experts were invited this year. They are currently working in 26 various departments. This year we allowed them to work in more types of offices. They work in Science Committee, Finance Ministry, Constitutional Court, President's office, Artsakh government, etc.

The average age is 33.

**Step Towards Home program**

It launched in June and invited 400 diasporan teenagers from 24 countries. The goal is education and culture. They were enrolled in language, dance, and culture classes. Trips were organized to historical sites. 

**about complaints from diaspora about lack of cooperation**

**Reporter:** some traditional diaspora representatives complain that the cooperation isn't as good after Diaspora Ministry was [converted as an office under executive branch]. They say they need better guidance from the Office on what to do.

**Sinanyan:** we can talk several hours around this topic, but I'll say this: There are such perceptions but it's not like they have ever received any serious guidance from Armenia in the past. Two things are happening:

1) After the war, some of the old traditional diasporan structures took a hostile stance towards Armenia and its government for political reasons. That is a big mistake and it harms our national interests. Some are playing into the hands of Turkish propaganda that's trying to poison Armenia-diaspora relations.   

2) There is a ""monopoly"" status in regard to traditional diasporan structures. For decades they were the only ones cooperating with the government. We have a more open approach. We are open to cooperating with more diasporan structures. We are willing to work absolutely with everyone, including those that have a very critical stance towards Armenia and the government after 2018. 

But they must accept that there won't be ""monopolies"". That ""monopoly"" status hasn't led to anything good. We should be united around the state. That state is in Armenia, and not diaspora. We need to work together for Armenia. 

**expanding Diaspora Office with the appointment of foreign commissioners**

*[It's about recruiting local activists around the world who know how their system works to help with promoting stuff.]* Our office is very small to cooperate with 7 million diaspora, so we need to expand. 

This program is new so we have not yet made appointments, but there are candidates. We are currently in the process of planning how to geographically divide countries to achieve our goal.  

**make the diasporans' voices heard in Armenia**

One option is to have a two-chamber parliament, with one being a Diaspora Consultative Chamber. The options are yet to be discussed in Armenia. We don't need to reinvent the wheel. There are working models around the world. There are various options.

##the goal is to increase the share of processing industry in GDP to 15% by 2026

**Economy Ministry:** we're developing a strategy for the development of 5 priority industrial sectors. They are diamond & jewelry, light & heavy industries, machinery, and pharma. 

There will be subsidy/leasing support programs for each sector. New technologies will be introduced in the heavy industry to increase automation.

💎 🙌 **diamond industry** 💎 🙌

Armenia has always had potential in the diamond field. Up until 2003 we had growth in diamond processing and export. The numbers began to gradually drop due to unfavorable import conditions. [Last week the government decided to form Hay Almast state company](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/rcqlsz/dec92021_expolice_chief_gasparyan_family_charged/) to aid the diamond industry.  

Hay Almast will sign contracts with Russian ""Alrusa"" and ""Gokhran"" companies to import raw materials for Armenian producers. Individual Armenian firms have difficulty signing long-term contracts with Russian firms. I believe we will see rapid growth in the industry after this.

Our goal is to bring the processing industry's GDP share to at least 15% by 2026.  

As for pharma, this year we began producing the Sputnik Lite vaccine. This is one of the first steps towards developing local pharma and exports. //

##Armenia will choose a ""Best Employer of the Year"" starting next year 

A memorandum was signed today between government agencies and worker's unions to launch a new annual initiative to choose the best employer of the year, starting 2022. Top-10 rating list will be created. 

**Inspection agency:** we travel a lot and penalize companies for breaking rules but we want to encourage the good ones, too.

The criteria will be developed in 1H2022. It'll take into account violations, complaints, physical working conditions, retraining programs, safety rules, and positive measures taken by the employer to protect worker rights.

The labor shortage and competition have contributed to a significant change in the mindset of employers. They don't want to exploit their workers. It's better to keep workers healthy and happy to maintain productivity. //

##Russia wishes peace and patience to Armenia and Azerbaijan

**Russian MFA:** NK conflict is one of the most complex ones. I wish peace and patience to AM and AZ, as well as to all those experts who are working, including from the Russian side. Everything can be solved if all sides make maximum efforts. //

Spokeswoman Zakharova said the Brussels meeting further develops the trilateral agreements of Sochi. There are efforts to unblock communication routes and delimit the borders.

##what's the status of the agricultural insurance industry?

*In 2019 the government decided to give subsidies to farmers to help insure their crops.*

**Economy Ministry:** we're ending 2021 with an increased activity compared to 2020. There were more contracts, more types of crops, more insured lands:

2020: 2,300 hectares | 1,546 contracts

2021: 5,830 hectares | 4,300 contracts

The types of crops that are covered by insurance went from 2 to 11. This year the insurance expanded to cover all provinces.

This year the three insurance firms collected ֏475M from farmers and paid ֏320M in compensation. The [loss ratio] was 67%, which is great because we were expecting to reach that level in 2023.

This is still a pilot program. In the near future we plan to expand the types of crops that are covered. //

The targets are the former energy minister of Malta and the former chief of staff of Malta's premier. The report does not mention Aliyev.

You may remember the Maltan journalist who was assassinated in 2017. She was investigating the two aforementioned individuals, among others. 
Wikileaks and Panama Papers had revealed corruption schemes between Azerbaijan's SOCAR and Maltan officials.

##COVID stats

6.2k tested. 135 infected. 407 healed. 3 deaths.

##Shirak province stats: vaccination rate is still low, but it's rising

27% is fully vaccinated. 39% have taken at least one dose.

95% of government, medical, and school workers.


##dozens of thousands of unused expired vaccines had to be thrown away 

**Ministry:** Some AstraZeneca and Moderna shots had to be purged. Covid vaccines have a shorter lifespan compared to measles and flu vaccines that can last 1-2 years.

Covid vaccine lifespan has improved from 1 to 9 months since its creation. A lot depends on how fast the vaccine is shipped to the country after it's manufactured.

In April-May, we received AstraZeneca vaccines as a gift but the demand wasn't high enough to use all of them within the 1-month expiration date. 27,000 shots had to be purged. You need to gather 10 people for the vaccine. It should be used within 6 hours of opening the vial. The leftover must be purged.

About as many Moderna shots were purged after the November 28 expiration date.

Moderna is kept at -20C in the main storage. Once you transfer it to clinics, it's kept at +2C to +8C, but you cannot bring it down to -20C again. We had to use it or throw it within 30 days. 

EU has extended Moderna's lifespan by 2 months, to 8. Pfizer and Sputnik have also extended lifespans. They are studying how effective the vaccine's protection will be after six months if the expiration date is extended. 

##not so fast, says Healthcare Ministry after Constitutional Court ruling

The top court ruled yesterday that the Ministry has no authority to require unvaccinated workers to pay for PCR tests out of pocket. 

**Ministry official:** the ruling does not require the state or employer to pay for the PCR test. The unvaccinated workers are still expected to submit PCR results. The part about ""worker pays for PCR"" was struck down, but the employer or other individuals can pay for it. //

In other news, the Parliament recently approved a law to allow employers to fire unvaccinated workers who refuse to present PCR results.

##flu is sending people to hospitals 

There are more emergency calls and hospitalizations relating to acute respiratory infections. It's especially active in Yerevan and the northern provinces. 

Doctors are recording a 2x increase from last year. There is an increase in the <4 and 5-14 age groups.

Influenza A (H3) variant is circulating and has resulted in the hospitalization of dozens of pregnant women in the past 4 weeks.

**Healthcare Ministry**: take your seasonal flu vaccine, limit the contact with individuals who have symptoms, stay home if you're sick, don't treat yourself with antibiotics at home, wear warm clothes, etc.

##is it true that the U.S. blocked a resolution during the UN Security Council session?

**Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan:** Thankfully the UNSC session was public so we were able to hear the opinions of the U.S. and other members. I think today the world clearly sees Azerbaijan's attempts to carry out ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh. 

You asked if the U.S. was hindering the passage of a resolution. I don't think the U.S. has any plans or wants to contribute to this ethnic cleansing. It would be hard for me to imagine that. 

I believe and I hope that the U.S. understands the magnitude of the worsening humanitarian crisis, and I hope the U.S. understands that a possible resolution would help resolve this situation and bring the parties back to the negotiation table.

##political infighting in Nagorno-Karabakh 

Nagorno-Karabakh's former State Minister (prime minister) Ruben Vardanyan, a Russian-Armenian billionaire who recently moved to Nagorno-Karabakh, is urging President Arayik Harutyunyan to ""keep his promise"" and resign. The President's allies have threatened to retaliate in case steps are taken to force the President's resignation.

**Analyst Suren Surenyants:** Here is what happened. They drafted a consensus scenario, the first step of which was quite illogical. They appointed the leader of the smallest opposition party [ARF] as the head of parliament.  

Then President Harutyunyan changed his mind midway and refused to give the rest of his powers to the parliament leader. He imitated a resignation. 

President Harutyunyan has been a weak leader. He has been under the influence of two factions from the beginning: 1) Ex-president Bako Sahakyan, 2) Pashinyan's man Masis Mayilyan.

Bako Sahakyan and Masis Mayilyan became ""shareholders"" in Harutyunyan's government. He tried to appease all parties by handing out positions.

The biggest problem with Harutyunyan is his lack of vision for the resolution of the crisis. He isn't making any decisions. Only speeches. 

Only Samvel Babayan has proposed a specific plan. I may not agree with all the points, but at least he has a plan. It's about launching a dialogue with Azerbaijan. 

The other politicians, like Ruben Vardanyan, say the right things but don't have a plan for achieving their goals.

Sergey Lavrov recently proposed a [14-point plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/15t4sml/un_security_council_discusses_azerbaijans/) for the integration of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians into Azerbaijan. It is worse than Lavrov's [March 2023](https://massispost.com/2023/03/sergey-lavrov-proposes-donbas-and-kosovo-serbian-local-self-government-models-for-nagorno-karabakh/) statement about creating a Kosovo Serbian self-government model for Armenians. To those who have already torched Lavrov's document: Do we have a better proposal? We do not. 

Lavrov's document doesn't envisage any status for Nagorno-Karabakh as a subject, and no political autonomy. It's about weak municipal-level rights or proportional rights. The mayor of Stepanakert could be Armenian, but there is no guarantee Baku won't arrest him the next day for any reason.

Russia proposed this plan so it could extend its peacekeeping mandate so at least the physical existence of Armenians could be guaranteed. 

All of this assumes that Azerbaijan would agree to it, which is not guaranteed.

**Reporter:** What do various power circles of Nagorno-Karabakh want? President Harutyunyan avoids decision-making at any cost. Ruben Vardanyan, who speaks on behalf of ex-presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh, does he support Lavrov's plan? 

**Surenyants:** They don't even know what they want. I hear a lot of political jargon. If we are going to replace Harutyunyan, then the replacement must at least have a realistic plan and not simply make statements about ""we must resist"".

There are two realistic options:

(1) We settle with guarantees that Armenians will physically exist (without a status).

(2) We develop norms for coexistence with Azeris.

**Reporter:** Samvel Babayan, the biggest opposition figure, has been sidelined, but he has proposed a plan to hold a dialogue with Azerbaijan to discuss coexistence. If the pressure on Harutyunyan increases, could he eventually make a deal with Samvel Babayan?

**Surenyants:** Yes. That would be the last resort for him, and he is quickly approaching that point, by judging from internal developments. 

But it's also possible that Samvel Babayan, Harutyunyan, and others could unite and form a crisis management group that would operate on the basis of consensus. There was a proposal to form one earlier. 

There are three power circles in Nagorno-Karabakh today:

(1) President Harutyunyan and his team.

(2) Ruben Vardanyan, Bako Sahakyan, Arkadiy Ghukasyan (ex-presidents).

(3) Samvel Babayan.

Ideally, they will form a consensus group and draft a specific plan of action that would describe their vision for NK-AZ relations and what NK believes is necessary to guarantee the coexistence with Azerbaijan and the protection of Armenians in NK.

##interview with ranking Armenian government official Andranik Kocharyan 

**REPORTER:** Ruben Vardanyan has accused the Armenian government of abandoning Nagorno-Karabakh.

**ANDRANIK:** Ruben Vardanyan is confusing Nagorno-Karabakh with Tatarstan. We stand with the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

**REPORTER:** Vardanyan is demanding the resignation of President Harutyunyan. In response, Harutyunyan's ruling party released a statement in support of the President, accusing Vardanyan of lacking statesmanship.

**ANDRANIK:** Do you remember the mysterious appearance of Ruben Vardanyan in Nagorno-Karabakh? Now we see his inexplicable behavior. Who is Ruben Vardanyan, and what is he doing in Nagorno-Karabakh? He revealed a shadowy process that our publics were unaware of. What secret dinner did they have and what was discussed during the dinner?

**REPORTER:** There were 8 people...

**ANDRANIK:** I know the names of those 8 people. He is very good at uploading photos and videos about the Armenian world, homeland Nagorno-Karabakh, but his statements about the past, present, and future are so contradictory that the dog doesn't recognize its owner. 

He then reveals himself in the form of Prince Hamlet and announces that 8 people were attempting to force the president to resign. 

**REPORTER:** Why?

**ANDRANIK:** For the power to be transferred to the current president of the parliament [minority ARF]. ARF has only 3 elected members in parliament. What is the point of transferring the power to them? What will that solve? 

Is it possible that their true intention is to manufacture a political crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh so they can transfer the crisis to Armenia? That won't happen. I'm confident that Harutyunyan won't resign. I welcome the statement by the ruling party aimed at Vardanyan.

Vardanyan should focus on collecting the stones from the church's backyard and dream about the Armenian Homeland. This is not the time for մունդռիկություն: These 8 figures should keep calm and contribute to the resolution of the ongoing crisis instead.

**REPORTER:** Are they attempting to give the presidential powers to ARF so it can better rally the Diaspora?

**ANDRANIK:** Why aren't they doing it today? The lao is still asleep. They can't even form unity around the Yerevan municipality elections. That's because people can see through it.

**REPORTER:** Who took part in the mysterious 8-person dinner?

**ANDRANIK:** Representatives of the former governments of Nagorno-Karabakh and former military apparatus members. It was 7+1, with the ""+1"" being Ruben Vardanyan, whose appearance in Nagorno-Karabakh is still a mystery.

**REPORTER:** What was the dinner about?

**ANDRANIK:** To capture power in Armenia. They couldn't do it from within Armenia, so they are trying to use Nagorno-Karabakh as a backdoor. That's why they push the propaganda that the ""Armenian government has abandoned Nagorno-Karabakh"". They are attacking the peace process, suggesting that ""we don't need it"". We do, in fact, need peace, so Armenia can restore its power. But they don't give a shit about restoring our losses. Their goal is to come to power. Life is not life if they don't have a chair.

Nagorno-Karabakh is the most important thing for Armenia today. It is the castle for our statehood. We've done everything possible to create the conditions to allow Armenians to continue to live in Nagorno-Karabakh. The [gang of 8], on the other hand, is busy with disheartening the population by claiming ""war is coming soon"", ""this is the end"". The best way to prevent war is to prepare for it while promoting peace. The opposition is sabotaging our efforts at every step: don't negotiate, don't open borders [with Turkey], don't try this and that. Their goal is to minimize the surface of diplomatic contact. These people still think we live in 1994. What we need is to end the practice of fearmongering the population and instill confidence instead. 

**REPORTER:** Are certain foreign powers [Russia] controlling the group of 8 in Nagorno-Karabakh?

**ANDRANIK:** Yes. Many superpowers have interests in our region. They want certain logistics and roads. They want loyal politicians who were fed with their promises for years. This is a matter of national security. Do you see how many wartime traitors authorities have uncovered so far? What does that tell us?

**REPORTER:** The government has decided to establish a new foreign intelligence agency focused on external threats due to the insufficient performance of other intelligence agencies before the war. How will its quality be any different if the agents continue to train in Russia?

**ANDRANIK:** They will undergo training in Armenia. In certain situations, when they are forced to train abroad, it will be done in a strictly monitored environment.

**REPORTER:** ... in Russia?

**ANDRANIK:** Not necessarily. We just want our agents to have complete loyalty to the Republic of Armenia.

**REPORTER:** Is it safe to fly jets to Kapan airport considering its proximity to Azerbaijan border?

**ANDRANIK:** My Azeri counterpart has made threats toward the airport. Excuse me, but who is he? Why is he telling us not to fly jets within our country? We will expose Azerbaijan's terroristic behavior. There will be consequences if Azerbaijan shoots down a civilian jet.

**REPORTER:** Before the launch of flights to our Kapan airport, Azerbaijan was complaining about Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians jamming Azeri jets. Were they lying to build a ground for provocation?

**ANDRANIK:** Then let's bring international observers to find out what's going on and who is telling the truth. The U.S. co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group was offering observers before the 2020 war. He wanted to use drones and other tech to monitor the NK-AZ borders. We could proceed with that plan today if Azerbaijan is concerned about ""shots"" fired by Armenians.

##why Armenia and Ukraine need Su-30SM and F-16 jets: interview with military expert Artsrun Hovhannisyan 

**ARTSUN:** We should have acquired them sooner. Let's revisit this topic now that Ukraine is going to receive F-16 jets. Why is F-16 still so important if Ukraine has already received numerous modern weapons?

In modern warfare, unless you want to sit in the same place and take a beating, you must have air superiority. For that, you must have jets. It's amateur talk that you can replace jets with drones or air-defense batteries.

The jet will help you clear and monitor the air, and carry out strikes from the air.

Let's study the Ukraine example. Ukraine has already received winged (cruise) missiles like StormShadow that are launched from a jet. They will soon receive the German Taurus. 

These missiles are long-range, but Ukraine's weakness is its aircraft fleet which cannot take full advantage of them. [Su-24 can carry those cruise missiles](https://www.eurasiantimes.com/its-official-ukrainian-su-24-fencer-fighter-jets-are-launchin/). 

2-4 units of Su-24 can take off simultaneously, receive protection from F-16 or something else, and safely climb high enough and get close enough for their missiles to be maximally successful.  

Instead, Ukraine is currently launching Su-24 jets one by one from secret airfields. They fly close to the ground in order to go undetected by the Russian airforce. Eventually, they climb <500 meters and fire 1-2 cruise missiles. This is only enough for the missiles to travel half of their intended range, around 150 km. If the Su-24 could climb >4 km, the missiles would fly 300 km.

To make this strategy work, before Su-24's main missile strike, Ukraine is attempting to synchronize a pre-strike by launching decoy missiles or drones to smother Russia's air defenses. The U.S. army does this ""preparatory work"" for 6-9 hours before the main strike.

Now, what would happen if Ukraine had F-16s? F-16 would take care of Russian Su-30 and Su-35, which is another topic of discussion. This would give the Su-24 fleet a narrow window of opportunity to climb a few kilometers. Ukraine would still need to fire decoy missiles, like the MALD that they used recently. After firing 40 decoy missiles and overwhelming Russia's air defense, 4-10 units of Su-24 could climb and fire 10-20 StormShadow missiles, which would then travel long enough and would have the maximum effectiveness.

Second example. Ukraine complains about Russia's Ka-52 helicopters. Russia is proud of their performance. Why? It's a similar situation that Armenia faced during the 2020 war, in which our main problem wasn't the Bayraktar drone, but rather Azeri Mi-8 helicopters equipped with Israeli SPIKE NLOS missiles that targeted our air defense batteries, vehicles, artillery, and tanks. Russia is attempting the same with its Ka-52 helicopters. 

The Russian helicopter climbs only 400-1000 meters to evade Ukraine's air defense with a 30-40 km range. They launch missiles with a 10-12 km range. 

Ukrainian battalions and even brigades on the frontline do not possess expensive air defense batteries with a 30 km range because they would be destroyed by Russian artillery. Therefore, Ukraine lacks the means to take down those Russian helicopters. Frontline troops do have smaller and cheaper things like MANPADs, OSA, and Strela-10, but these are not powerful enough to reach the Russian helicopters.

What is the solution? My friends. The king of air superiority is the jet. Your jet can remain deep within your territory and destroy the enemy helicopter even if the latter is only at a 500m altitude. The jet is the only practical solution.

This is why Armenia needed/needs the Su-30 jets. That's how you destroy those Azeri Mi-8 helicopters carrying SPIKE NLOS. There is simply no other solution in this situation. Armenia must have a strong aviation doctrine.

Ukraine's counteroffensive is slow partially due to a lack of [F-16] jets. What could the F-16 do against the revered Russian Su-35S w/Irbis radio, Su-30SM, and MiG-31? When you pit them 1v1, the Su-35S could outperform the likely-outdated version of the F-16 that Ukraine will receive. But the reality is that the Western airforce is applied with a specific doctrine that couples the use of jets with strong intel, radio, and other pieces of information that are passed to Ukraine remotely by its allies.

For example, if the Netherlands ends up sending the older generation of F-16 jets, which are also possessed by Turkey, with only 70-90 km AMRAAM millies, Ukraine's Western allies could still use their own air control system AWACS and other methods of intel to detect targets far away and feed the info to F-16. 

This is something that Russia lacks. Russia doesn't have a developed satellite and AWAC system integrated with its airforce. Besides that, the missiles that give the Russian airforce a long reach, are very very few in number. 

Armenia did receive some missiles for its Su-30SM jets, and we were supposed to import those long-range R-77 and XA-59 missiles from Russia next, but as you can see from the Ukraine war, Russia can't even produce them for its own army in significant quantities.

When Armenia purchased the Su-30SM, these missiles were still undergoing tests in Russia. Russia told us they weren't ready for use. *""We will give them to you when they are ready.""*

Read the Russian defense ministry report and see how many Xa-59 missiles are used weekly. Very few. Armenia was expecting to import those missiles. That's a little background for you.

If Ukraine imports 3-5 squadrons of F-16 connected to NATO's extremely-developed radio/intel apparatus... The U.S. has the world's most developed system. For every 1 combat aircraft, they have 1 piece of equipment or a jet that provides intel and radio warfare support to the combat aircraft. No other country has that ratio. In Russia, every 1,000 combat aircraft has 50 pieces of supportive equipment/jets. NATO can help Ukraine in this department, just as they help HIMARSes to strike their targets.

Up next: We'll discuss the importance of air doctrine for Armenia.

One of the Azeri pilots who died on Sep-27 is Major Qasim Abbas oglu. He was a State Border Security (SBS) officer and not from the Defense Ministry.

Russia's largest govt-run *Channel 1* outlet has a prime-time talk-show called ""Time will tell"", which invited Armenian, Azeri, and Russian experts for debates.

Russian reporter was invited to explain the situation. He mentioned the situation in Stepanakert and how Azeris [failed to take and] damaged the northern highway connecting Armenia to Artsakh, with Turkish Bayraktar drones. 

**Azeri Guest:** how do you know Azeris used Turkish drones?

**Russian Reporter:** these drones are made in Turkey.

**Russian Host:** hold on. Let's assume the drones were of ""unknown origin"". Now let's analyze which drones they were.

**Russian Reporter:** ... the Azeri side doesn't hide it's Turkish...

**Russian Host responds to Azeri Guest:** here is a video [shows a Bayraktar video] published by Azeris showing the destruction of several Armenian vehicles. The footage appears to be recorded from a Turkish drone. Period.

**Russian Reporter continues:** we visited Stepanakert and saw the outcome of the Azeri GRAD missile attack that was used against a completely peaceful civilian house.

**Russian Host:** have you learned any info on who started this war?

**Russian Reporter:** locals say Azerbaijan began bombing at 7:10 am yesterday. I know each side will blame the other, but I'm more concerned about civilians. I spoke with 2 Armenian kids in a bomb shelter. Their house was bombed. It's not even near any military object.

**Azeri guest:** Pashinyan started this. He escalated the situation this year. 

**Russian Guest enters chat:** so you're telling me it's Armenians who started it, while it was Azeris who launched a partial draft ahead of time and brought reinforcements?

**Azeri Guest:** .... because Armenians provoked 

**Russian Guest:** ... ""provoked"" by ""using words"" but they didn't open fire. [host interrupts]

**Russian Host to Azeri Guest:** when you say Pashinyan is the one who verbally provoked, I can assure you that both sides made provocative statements, including the Turkish side.

*[the main theme became the Turkish involvement in the conflict. The Russian host and guests are not pleased. They blasted Erdogan's statements.]*

**Russian Host:** let's use logic about who started the war. Here is a video *[of Azeri soldiers being destroyed during an unsuccessful attempt to capture northern highway through a gorge near Mrav]*. Someone gave those soldiers an order to move forward. Why?

**Armenian Guest:** obviously the order was given by the Azeri govt. It's elementary logic. Armenia has no reason to start a war. Karabakh is already de-facto free. 

**Azeri Guest:** Nope, Armenians started it. It's beneficial for Armenia to provoke a war.

**Armenian Guest:** why would they?

**Azeri Guest:** so Artsakh separatists can launch a process for independence. *(apparently crack pipe is on sale on Amazon. Cyber Crackday. Black Plaqueday. Big if true.)*

**Russian Host sits next to Azeri guest:** are you sure about that? 

**Azeri Guest:** Yes. Why not?

*[theme changes about Syrian mercenaries]*

**Russian Host:** I can't confirm 100%, but here is a video from Azerbaijan showing a column of fighters in pickup trucks with flags and [Allahu Akbar] chants. Do these men chant in Azeri or Arabic?


**Azeri Guest:** they are Azeri because I heard their accent with ""e"" instead of ""a"" while chanting ""akbar"". Syrians don't have ""e"". It's unique to Turkic.

**Armenian Guest:** the pro-Turkish fighters in northern Syria are ethnic Turkmen, not necessarily Arab.

**Russian Guest:** we can send it to professional linguists for analysis.

Human lives are not important for the dictatorial regime in Baku. President Aliev's goal is to save his power. This adventure will cost them dearly...

(Aliyev said he is committed to the  format of the negotiations and blamed Armenia for failing it with ""unacceptable demands"".)

*Karabakh is internationally recognised as Azerbaijani territory but part of it is run by breakaway ethnic Armenian authorities who say the area is their ancestral homeland. It has been at the centre of two wars - the latest in 2020 - since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.*

*Loud and repeated shelling was audible from social media footage filmed in Stepanakert, the capital of Karabakh, called Khankendi by Azerbaijan, on Tuesday.*

*The Karabakh separatist human rights ombudsman, Gegham Stepanyan, said the civilian population had sustained ""multiple casualties"" as a result of strikes by Azerbaijan's military. Reuters could not immediately verify his assertion.*

*In a statement announcing its operation, Azerbaijan's defence ministry spoke of its intention to ""disarm and secure the withdrawal of formations of Armenia’s armed forces from our territories, (and) neutralise their military infrastructure"".*

*It said it was only targeting legitimate military targets using ""high-precision weapons"" and not civilians as part of what it called a drive to ""restore the constitutional order of the Republic of Azerbaijan"".*

*Civilians were free to leave by humanitarian corridors, it added, including one to Armenia.*

*Ethnic Armenian forces in Karabakh said Azerbaijani forces were trying to break through their defences after heavy shelling, but that they were holding the line for now.*

It will hold Azerbaijan solely responsible for the fate of the civilian populations of Nagorno-Karabakh.

France requests the emergency convening of a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. It is working closely with its European and American partners so that a strong response is provided to this unacceptable offensive, commensurate with the risks it poses to the security of the region.

**REPORTER:** The #1 reason why we lost the 2020 war?

**ARTSRUN:** We overestimated our strength and underestimated our opponent. 

**REPORTER:** What mistakes did the government make during the war?

**ARTSRUN:** During a war, the decisions are made by the military-political leadership. If we ignore all the pre-existing problems that had accumulated prior to the war and focus only on the wartime decisions, the War Commission's investigation has revealed the following problems:  

1) Being too lax on deserters and disorderly conduct. The first deserters from the mobilized troops should have been tied to *the Pole of Shame* like they did in Ukraine.

**REPORTER:** In 1994, Vazgen Sargsyan was catching deserters in airports and sending them back to the front.

**ARTSRUN:** That's what was missing in 2020.

**REPORTER:** ... or doing what Gen. Samvel Babayan used to do in Artsakh?

**ARTSRUN:** I don't know, it's a matter of taste. We should have been a lot tougher in 2020.

**REPORTER:** We've criticized the Armenian government but doesn't Artsakh's military-political leadership also share the blame? An absurd myth was developed after the 90s' that Armenia supposedly didn't help Artsakh to win the 1st war; Artsakh's leadership received full credit for the victory. So why are we giving full credit to the Artsakh government for the 1st victory, but not assigning the full blame on them for the defeat in the 2nd?

**ARTSRUN:** I agree. My criticism of lax policies during the war was primarily aimed at Artsakh leadership. 

**REPORTER:** But wasn't Armenia's CoGS managing the war? 

**ARTSRUN:** That's irrelevant. The second legal pyramid was created to give Artsakh's military-political leadership independent powers. When it came to purely the military pyramid, there was a clear subordination system between Armenia's CoGS and Artsakh's Defense Army, but this wasn't the case with other types of forces such as NSS border forces, police forces, etc. Some of them never sent a single report to Armenia's CoGS for years. They were fully independent. 

Here is what the army leadership was doing for 20 years instead of reforms. Instead of promoting young officers who graduated from Greek [NATO] or other schools, they were promoting drivers and cooks from the 1st war who were ""good boys"" and obeyed them well in the 90s'. [Someone's ջահել]

Artsakh had 9 defense districts without counting the separate artillery, tank, and separate military units. I'm challenging the critics to study the 1994-2020 period and tell me the number of people, who joined the army after 1994 and graduated from domestic or international military academies, who were assigned to command a regiment/brigade in Artsakh. 

**REPORTER:** There was no political pressure on the military to reform?

**ARTSRUN:** Exactly. And there was no pressure to modernize armament, either. The sides began to make more or less serious weapon purchases, and not rely primarily on the equipment left from the first war, starting in 2003-2004. Before 2003, Armenia's new stuff was almost solely ""gifts"" from Russia. They were sending old Soviet stuff from storage. Some were broken, and some were half-fine.

Azeris make large-scale purchase contracts starting in 2003. It reaches a peak in 2007-2008 with the largest contracts surpassing $2bn-$3bn. The suppliers were Israel, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, etc. These weapons began to arrive in 2009-2010. By 2011 they were receiving the largest batches (200-300 units) of modern tanks, 100-200 units of new artillery, drones, etc. Starting in 2011, Azerbaijan had higher quality and newer assault-oriented weapons.

The first time Armenia paid attention to this topic was in 2012 when they ""expressed interest"" by inquiring Russia about the available new weapons. Significant negotiations begin only in 2014, and in 2015 we received very few units of certain models. You could count them on my 5 fingers.   

**REPORTER:** They purchased modern air defense but in a small quantity?

**ARTSRUN:** No, the purchased air defense units weren't even modern. Do you remember the massive PR story around the import of 5-6 divisions of S300? They were a ""gift"" from Russia, in a non-operational condition, sent from the Moscow Military District. We spend 5 years on fixing them, .. [unintelligible]

**REPORTER:** ... so we were էշի ականջում քնած all those years?

**ARTSRUN:** Yes, and everyone with military background knew about this at the time but the politically-motivated deceptions continued.

The first pair of SMERCH stations, which in reality played a significant role during the war, were imported in the autumn of 2016. Armenia and Artsakh had a total of 6 units of SMERCH when the war began. Azerbaijan imported the first unit in 2011, and entered the war with 32 units, without counting the other 20 units that had a similar diameter but with a 2x-3x longer reach. This played a decisive role during the war.

Moreover, Armenia's 6 Smerches were firing missiles only 1-3 pieces at a time, like a grandma taking her pills. It didn't have the potential of a 12-unit volley fire effect. We didn't have the missiles. In comparison, Azerbaijan's 50 pieces of 300+ caliber units played a decisive role. It wasn't just their drones.

They had 1,000-1,500 drones with 50+ km reach. They started purchasing them starting 2005, and especially in 2010-2012.

This was the difference between $2bn and $20bn, sleeping for 8 years while the opponent prepared, then responding with 10x fewer purchases.

##Nagorno-Karabakh president about the food shortage, peacekeepers, and ""puppet masters""

In response to criticism from opposition officials who claimed that PM Pashinyan is controlling President Arayik's moves.

**ARAYIK:** Lots of populist statements were made by our opposition colleagues. You've left me no choice but to answer: the only one that's being managed from Yerevan is you. You are taking orders from the Armenian opposition.

**ANGRY OPPOSITION MP:** [interrupts]

**ARAYIK:** Silence... Last time you accused me of surrendering three settlements in the Lachin Corridor to Azerbaijan. Yes, we were forced to hand over 3 villages in Qashatagh (Berdzor) in order to avoid much bigger losses and total extinction. We're doing everything possible to avoid large-scale military clashes. I have shared with you every message exchanged between us, Russian peacekeepers, and Azeris. Russians were *forcing* us to hand over those settlements. So why don't you go and demand action from Russia instead, and ask them why [they aren't been following their promises]. 

You've always claimed it isn't the peacekeepers' fault, and I've always coordinated my actions with peacekeepers. It isn't [Pashinyan] forcing us to do it, it's the peacekeepers.

There were complaints about beer being imported [through a blockade]. You know very well it wasn't imported through official channels. We were using our very limited resources on securing food deliveries for our residents. Why don't we arrest those who imported beer, you may wonder. Well, then we must arrest many people. You know that hundreds of people on both sides, you know who, are engaged in that process.

It was a batch of imports that was outside of the import allowance allocated to Artsakh, you could say. *[Russian peacekeepers allegedly imported party stuff, pissing off the locals. Unverified, but doesn't require a rocket science degree to understand who imported it.]* It wasn't imported through vehicles belonging to us. Were we supposed to ban the entry of those vehicles? Were we supposed to shut down any store that sold non-essential products? We've struggled to import necessities, we've done everything in our power. 

Here is an item missing from shelves: vegetable oil. We will soon have limited quantities of locally produced oil, it won't taste as good, but at least it'll be there. We couldn't import more oil. Do you even understand how difficult it is to feed 120,000 people when your imports are limited, and some of your imports must be construction materials for essential repairs?

Since you've accused me of populism, I'll say this: our opposition cares about Coca-Cola on the shelves and Armenia's internal political life more than the state of our Defense Army. I haven't received a single letter from them asking about the army and how to help it. Sorry [for the fiery speech]. Thanks. Come and ask us to explain what we're doing to strengthen the army. Meet us. We will hear your opinions. 

https://youtu.be/uScnMeeb5UM



##Nagorno-Karabakh president explains the reason why there are no direct negotiations with Azerbaijan

**ARAYIK:** We either endure this hardship and reach our goal of being recognized as an independent state, or we enjoy Coca-Cola and freely travel through Lachin Corridor with our Azerbaijani passports. 

We've seen worse days. You can criticize me for not accumulating enough food reserves in advance, sure, but such reserves would have lasted only months, while our struggle is long-term. We do have some local production, so do not be dishearted and do not give up. Sadly we lost thousands of hectares to poor weather conditions. If not for that, we could have been self-sufficient. We've also lost lands during the invasion.

We will spend this winter without gas and electricity. Azerbaijan has offered to resume the flow if we send an envoy to Baku. Why have we rejected it? Because they only want to discuss  ""integration"", and nothing else. 

I've attempted to negotiate with them for 2 years. If you think I did a poor job, then you should know that I wasn't the negotiator during the last phase. The negotiations yielded no results because Azerbaijan only demands one thing, and they do this during all formats: UN, U.S., etc.

This is what Azerbaijan demands in order for them to even agree to sit down around the same table with us: ""dissolve your army"". And here is what their plan is, chronologically:

1) We visit Baku and declare the dissolution of our Defense Army.

2) We dissolve the governing system.

3) They create a mechanism for community elections.

4) They resume the flow of gas and electricity, and we'll be able to cross the Lachin corridor as Azerbaijani citizens.

We are not against negotiations with Azerbaijan. We were the ones who wanted it the most. So let's understand that we are definitely going to have problems, but it is all surmountable. We must work on our resilience and self-defense.

##where was this Artsakh-Azerbaijan meeting supposed to take place?

Last month the U.S. offered to mediate direct talks between Baku and Stepanakert, somewhere outside of Artsakh, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. 

Artsakh rejected it because of the aforementioned conditions set forth by Azerbaijan, according to the leader of the ruling party of Artsakh. 

**PARTY LEADER:** Even the efforts by Russian peacekeepers were futile. They organized a meeting with Azeris in March. We attempted to discuss humanitarian issues, but after the meeting, Azeris claimed we were discussing topics of ""integration"".

##U.S. ambassador to Armenia about the negotiations

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. reaffirms its stance that the rights and security of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh must be protected. There must be negotiations, the outcome of which should protect these rights. Families must feel safe in their homes and their environment. All sides have an agreement around this. Now there are efforts to find ways to achieve that. 

**REPORTER:** Do you believe it is possible to organize a direct Baku-Stepanakert dialogue?

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** Any negotiation is a step in the right direction. We must ensure that the concerns of both sides are heard, so they can find a road to peace, which will guarantee the rights and security of those who live in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**REPORTER:** Russia has a vital interest in the South Caucasus, so its heavy involvement in the mediation process is understandable. Why is the U.S. so active? Critics accuse the U.S. of attempting to drive Russia out of the region. If this happens, Armenia will be left alone against Turkey and Azerbaijan, say your critics.

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. believes that Armenia, as an independent state, can decide who its partners and allies are, and what its foreign policy direction will be. What the U.S. wants is peace in Europe and South Caucasus. We are ready to work with anyone who's trying to bring a piece in these regions. The U.S. and EU are heavily involved in this process because we both see that peace in this region would be very beneficial for us. 

We have strong interests in Armenia. We share the same democratic values. Armenia is truly a bright spot in this region in terms of democracy. It is advancing its reform agenda, it has freedom of the press and speech, and democracy that's strengthening every day. The U.S. views democratic states as the most stable states, with stable relations with other members of the international community.   

**REPORTER:** Your critics believe you will choose Azerbaijan's oil over Armenia's democracy. Iran is defending Armenia's territorial integrity from Azerbaijan, while authoritarian Azerbaijan is engaged in a ""verbal conflict"" with Iran. The U.S. then blames Iran for being a destabilizing force in the region. Why? 

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** As an independent state, Armenia can choose to have whatever relations it wants with its neighbor Iran. We value the fact that Armenia is maintaining the sanctions on Iran set by the U.S. But past that, Armenia itself must decide what relations to have with Iran.

**REPORTER:** Is the OSCE Minsk Group *dead* dead?

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. is attempting to find ways to move the existing negotiations forward. Sadly, with its aggressive actions in Ukraine, Russia has proven itself as an unreliable partner, so we've been working with our trusted partners in the EU. No, the Minsk Group hasn't been dissolved, so if it's possible to have a constructive work environment in that format, we would certainly consider it.

**REPORTER:** A U.S. firm is building a metallurgy plant on the border with Azerbaijan. Shots were fired by Azerbaijan. 

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. believes that Azeri and Armenian forces should conduct a mirrored pullback of their forces from the border to avoid such incidents. We hope the sides will reach an agreement to do so. 

**REPORTER:** Can you give us some weapons? *[Bruh, might as well keep her hostage in exchange for a Himars]*. That would restore the balance of power and make peace negotiations more effective. Today maximalist Azerbaijan believes it can act with impunity.

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** Azerbaijan is negotiating. They sit around the table and hold talks with Armenia. The U.S. has done everything possible to promote the process. Yes, we do have relations with Armenia in the security field. At the request of Armenia, we are doing things to help Armenia's security. We highly appreciate Armenia's involvement in global peacekeeping. There have been many exercises involving Armenia to promote the potential of its peacekeeping forces. We've also provided assistance in the military-medical field. The mobile medical stations have already saved lives. We also have exchange programs involving military experts; Armenian officers visit the U.S. to study our experience. We are also discussing Armenia's needs in the future. We are always open to such discussions. I'd say we already have serious relations with Armenia in this area. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan wants a corridor via Armenia. They are threatening.

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** Threats = no good. The U.S. is encouraging the sides to discuss improvements in their transportation systems. The USAID has carried out an assessment of the transport field in Armenia and presented various routes. These are roads in general, not just connected to Azerbaijan. We want to encourage both sides to develop their roads. Having better connections in the region would be only beneficial in the case of Armenia. It will help Armenian goods to reach other places and to import goods from other places like Europe. This will reduce Armenia's overreliance on [Russia]. It would also increase Armenia's energy independence. 

**REPORTER:** Will the Turkey-Armenia border open?

**AMBASSADOR KVIEN:** The U.S. is encouraged by the direct talks between AM-TR. The normalization of relations will bring many benefits to Armenia, and it will make the entire region more stable. It was a very kind gesture by Armenia to deliver humanitarian aid to Turkey after the earthquake. My colleagues in Turkey have informed me that Turkey greatly appreciated that move. Turkish residents who received the aid on the ground were very appreciative. These gestures are helping build trust between the people.

##interview with Nagorno-Karabakh opposition politician and former Security Council Gen. Samvel Babayan about building trust between Armenians and Azeris 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan's continuous blockade of the Lachin Corridor has resulted in a food shortage crisis. Artsakh authorities are rejecting any dialogue with Azerbaijan outside of international platforms, while Azerbaijan rejects any negotiations with a mediator because they consider this as an internal matter. Should Artsakh authorities agree to direct talks, or continue their ""boycott""?

**BABAYAN:** First of all, Azerbaijan is not against any negotiation with a mediator. There was supposed to be a meeting at the suggestion of the U.S. but Artsakh authorities rejected it. I believe there must be direct talks aimed at building trust, completely unrelated to ""status"" talks. The two nations first need to learn to live peacefully together. Everything else can be discussed later. Without this, you can negotiate another 30 years without a result. 

If Azerbaijan doesn't agree to build trust with Armenians, then Azerbaijan won't achieve its main goal of expelling Russians from here.

**REPORTER:** Do you agree that Azerbaijan doesn't mind if Russian peacekeepers assume the role of the 3rd party mediator?

**BABAYAN:** No. It's the exact opposite. Azerbaijan wants direct Stepanakert-Baku talks. As the leader of the second political force in Artsakh, I'm not against that idea, but Artsakh must first develop a negotiation document aimed at building trust.

**REPORTER:** I didn't mean using Russia as a state as the 3rd party mediator. I meant the commander of Russian peacekeepers on the ground. Could he just sit around the table as a mediator? 

**BABAYAN:** No. Azerbaijan wants one on one meetings. It's not just Artsakh residents who are under blockade, it's also the peacekeepers. They are trying to force Russians to use Azerbaijani-controlled Aghdam road to deliver supplies, instead of the Lachin Corridor.

**REPORTER:** Regardless of the format, Azerbaijan will demand the following: dissolve the Defense Army, accept Azerbaijani citizenship, and dissolve the government structure. This will leave the future of many Artsakh residents with Armenian ties and citizenship in limbo. What solutions do you see?

**BABAYAN:** You and I look at this issue from different angles. I'm not sure what Azerbaijan's end goal is, but my proposal is to discuss a package that contains points of common interests, to gain trust towards each other. Azerbaijan should pull back its troops, create a Green Zone, etc. Many things can be done to build trust. 

Artsakh must present this document to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan will reply with its version. None of this will contain any talks about a 'status'. It's about building trust for now. If we try this and it doesn't work, then we go back to ""digging trenches"". Don't ""think"" on behalf of Azerbaijan, give them an opportunity to reply in written form. 

If Azerbaijan rejects it, only then you can tell the superpowers that you've tried everything but Azerbaijan rejected all diplomacy. Right now we are just complaining about something that Azerbaijan hasn't even presented in written form. 

**REPORTER:** You have a different stance than the Artsakh authorities. You disagree that negotiations *must* be held with an international mediator. You believe a direct dialogue is necessary to start building something large with small steps. What political leverage do you have to convince the Artsakh government to adopt your approach? Would you agree to be the negotiator?

**BABAYAN:** Artsakh government and opposition parties both have the same demand: negotiations with the presence of an international mediator, and Artsakh participating as an ""equal"" party. I disagree with both [government and opposition parties]. Similarly, Azerbaijan's demands that Artsakh must become a small community managed by Baku is also too extreme. My proposal is to take small steps towards trust, so the two people won't feel a heavy burden anymore. With that done, during the second phase, when deeper issues are discussed, we can invite international structures to take part in those talks, or we can invite them at the very end. 

The Artsakh government and opposition parties are trying to avoid any responsibility. They say ""it won't work"" but they forget that they are responsible for the lives of 120,000 people and they must resolve these issues. President Arayik's 35,000 voters must take to the streets and demand action. If you demand, I will serve you.

**REPORTER:** To serve as a president or as a negotiator? Are you calling for a 2018-style revolution in Artsakh?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. If the president is against the negotiation plan that I just explained, then how can he assign me as an envoy to negotiate that plan on behalf of the state? Someone has to assume full responsibility and enter into negotiations. Since Artsakh has already held a referendum and declared its independence, if a time comes and there is a need to discuss our status with Azerbaijan, we will first need to hold a vote in Artsakh to authorize the negotiator to negotiate it. But this isn't the topic of discussion at this phase. We must first build human relations and trust.

**REPORTER:** Have you spoken with President Arayik about your plan? Did you offer him your help?

**BABAYAN:** On numerous occasions. I send him the list of points that need to be negotiated with Azerbaijan at this stage. The government and opposition must gather together and draft one document and assume some responsibility. The public is currently waiting to see what will happen. Nothing good will happen, they are going to drive you off the cliff if no action is taken.

**REPORTER:** Russian peacekeepers won't stop Azeri soldiers if they decide to invade Artsakh now. How would the events unfold in such a scenario?

**BABAYAN:** Develop a document and go negotiate if you don't want that scenario. But I think Azerbaijan understands me very well. They understand that if they push too hard, a third party [Russia] will enter the game and it will be even less beneficial for Azerbaijan. It's in Azerbaijan's best interest not to do this. The big players will play, while both our countries will suffer. Let's give these negotiations a try. If it doesn't work, we will have another war, but at least we've tried.

**REPORTER:** Would Armenia send military support to Artsakh in the event of an attack? Artsakh Defense Army isn't in a position to defend Stepanakert today.

**BABAYAN:** No, but a bloody move would result in a serious international backlash, including by Russia. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of peacekeepers firing back because many cards are in play there for Russia. I also wouldn't rule out action by Iran. This is why I think it's possible to sit down and hold talks with Azerbaijan. I'm confident in my negotiation proposal, I know why it could work.

**REPORTER:** Artsakh sent you as the negotiator after the 1st war. You sat with Russian and Azeri envoys. Azeris know you very well, and your contribution to the 90s' victory. What makes you think Azeris will want to speak with you considering your participation in the war? 

**BABAYAN:** There is not a single person who grew up in Artsakh who hasn't fought a war. But it doesn't matter if they will speak with me or someone else who represents my ideas.

**REPORTER:** In your 5-point plan to develop Artsakh, you mention the need to create a professional army. How can you do this under a blockade, when the imports are restricted? Was this plan drafted when Lachin was still open?

**BABAYAN:** Perhaps we won't even need it if Azerbaijan agrees to hold talks around building trust, Green Zone, etc. Maybe we will create a [unintelligable] Guard. The goal is to achieve peace and for us to remain in our homeland and live our lives.    

**REPORTER:** A strong Armenian army could also benefit Artsakh's security. Tell us about the army issues exposed during the 2020 war, and whether steps are being taken to address them. 

**BABAYAN:** I've been isolated from Armenia for 4 months now, so I don't know. Artsakh must secure its own defense, and we will do it. Azerbaijan must understand that our door isn't open, they can't just walk in. But how this is done or whether it's even *necessary* will depend on the level of trust between us.

**REPORTER:** EU wants to further expand the number of observers on the AM-AZ border. They often visit the border with Artsakh. Do you believe they are a stabilizing force, including for Artsakh?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. Azerbaijan is being pressured primarily by the U.S. and EU today because Russia is busy in Ukraine. This pressure from the West is why Azerbaijan is more ""humble"" today. Yes, I believe observers have a significant contribution to stabilizing the region. We must use this opportunity to regain strength.

**REPORTER:** Armenian government is trying to send international observers to Artsakh as well. Pashinyan and Mirzoyan have been discussing this with their EU colleagues.

**BABAYAN:** I support that. We need a UN presence, an international body that can gather the facts on the ground. As for military presence, for now, only Russian peacekeepers can be here, but we can't predict what will happen in a couple of years.

**REPORTER:** What was your takeaway from Pashinyan's statement and Q&A at the War Commission? He spoke about the problems in the military.

**BABAYAN:** He repeated what I had been saying for years. The military leadership was unorganized, weak, and had low standards. How can an officer refuse an order from a general? The Army Commander issues an order to attack but a Lt. Colonel disobeys the order. This mess is what led us to defeat. We don't need the prime minister to give a speech about these incidents being under investigation. These officers must have been arrested and punished long ago. I am aware of criminal investigations, some of which have already reached the court.

**REPORTER:** You were Artsakh's Security Council chief during the war and you took part in the preparation of one of the counteroffensives. Your plan was approved by Artsakh Defense Army commander and Armenia's army command CoGS. The operation failed because the commander of one of the tank battalions refused to fight. There is a criminal investigation against that commander today. Tell us about that operation.

**BABAYAN:** I made a proposal but did not take part in the process to draft that plan because I didn't have details about the personnel and other nuances, so the plan had to be created by the army command. In 1993 we liberated the same areas with a similar plan. They created a plan, investigated the area, and launched the attack. 

Azeris did not put up a resistance because they thought the approaching soldiers were friendlies. Our forces succeeded there. But then the second unit disobeyed the order and refused to move forward. Besides this, none of the two brigades showed up in time at 7 am that morning. [When they did, not everyone delivered all the necessary equipment.]
They were supposed to deliver 44 tanks and 30-40 armored vehicles. They instead brought 12 tanks and a few armored vehicles. 

The commander should have delayed the offensive by 2 days to sort out the problems. Instead, they engaged with the opponent. But even after these mistakes, our troops forced Azeris to route in confusion. There were no Azeris in sight for 3 whole hours. But our forces did not advance, they remained in place, refused to carry out orders, then the following day they were unable to reorganize. It was a result of unprofessionalism. We could have won this war if they weren't *that* unorganized.

Why do you think the commanding officer of the tank battalion refused to engage? [The commander allegedly learned that the plan belonged to Babayan and refused to follow it for political reasons, according to Babayan.] 

**REPORTER:** Why did that brigade commander refuse? Intentional or irresponsible?

**BABAYAN:** 20 tanks mysteriously broke down on their way from Stepanakert to Fizuli [battlefield]. Did the commander sabotage the operation intentionally? I don't know. There needs to be an investigation. 80% of the ranking officers weren't in their place. Do you understand what that means? There was no order whatsoever. These officers didn't join the army to fight, they just wanted to be security guards.

**REPORTER:** The War Commission revealed that Armenians had 117,000 soldiers but they couldn't bring 5,000 to defend Shushi.

**BABAYAN:** That is the wrong number. We actually had *more* than that, but the number isn't what's important. The problem with Shushi was in their defense tactic and the fact that the commanders weren't ""present"", from top to bottom. This wasn't an issue with the army having an insufficient number of soldiers to defend Shushi. They could have easily moved troops around had it been necessary. But they didn't do the necessary maneuvers. Someone said, *""No, we are waiting for the main assault from this direction, don't carry out any operations there""*. I can't speak about this publicly but you should know that there were multiple strategies to defend Shushi. It's just that there was no one to properly command it.

##exodus begins 

Russian peacekeepers escorted over 1,500 Armenians out of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday. Another 10,000 have become homeless and could soon join them. The rest of the population will be allowed to move as well, said the government of Nagorno-Karabakh.

**DAVID BABAYAN, adviser to NK president:** The fate of our poor people will go down in history as a disgrace and a shame for the civilized world. Those responsible for our fate will one day have to answer before God for their sins. 

**REFUGEE FROM STEPANAKERT:** I can't describe how terrible the situation was. Stores have been empty. We've been hungry for a year. Long lines. The last few days have been horrible. So many deaths and bombings. I don't want to see Azeri faces ever again. I had to leave my sons behind. One of them [possibly a soldier] went to the forests. He came down yesterday but had to stay behind to bury his friend. My younger son is still in Stepanakert with his children. I don't have any relatives in Armenia, no place to stay, but I've heard the government plans to distribute housing and aid.

The electricity was cut off a while ago. It was connected to the Azerbaijani grid on Sunday. The residents of some districts reported receiving electricity. The Azerbaijani regime disconnected the supply of vital energy sources 10 months ago in an attempt to subjugate the local population. The gas flow is still blocked. No electricity in the vast majority of the republic.

##Pashinyan's Sunday speech: Azerbaijan AND Russia will be responsible for ethnic cleansings if no conditions are created for Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians to continue to live in their homes

**PASHINYAN:** The attacks by Azerbaijan against Armenia over the past few years have made it *obvious* that [our defense partnership with Russia] is ineffective. This was visible in 2020, May and November of 2021, September 2022, and the list goes on.

The December 2020 invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh villages Khtsaberd and Hin Tagher and the capturing of over 60 Armenian soldiers, the Parukh incidents, the numerous examples of terror against Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, the illegal blockade of the Lachin corridor, Azerbaijan's September 19 attack on Nagorno-Karabakh, are all raising serious questions about the purpose and motives of deploying Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. 

Despite the Nov. 9 tripartite statement, Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh are still facing ethnic cleansings. The entry of a small amount of humanitarian aid in recent days does not change the situation. If no real conditions are created for Armenians to continue to live in their homes, they will have no option but to leave their homeland. The full responsibility will be on Azerbaijan and the Russian peacekeepers. 

Armenia is working with international partners to form an international mechanism for the protection of the rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. But if this effort fails, Armenia is ready to host the refugees.

Armenia has always followed its allied responsibilities and has never betrayed [Russia]. But the analysis of events shows that [Russia is trying to prove that Armenia cannot be an independent state]. And this has absolutely nothing to do with the 2018 revolution in Armenia and its outcome. We have seen [steps by Russia to prove Armenia cannot be independent] over the past few decades. The 2016 war and several other events took place in this context.

We have never agreed with the formulations questioning the independence of Armenia. But it's concerning that instead of accepting our will to be free and democratic, [Russia] has instead chosen to make Armenia more vulnerable, and now also by endangering our internal security. They have violated diplomatic and interstate ethics in addition to ignoring contractual obligations. 

In response to these actions, we urge [Russia] to respect Armenia's statehood and sovereignty, and we express our resolute will to strengthen our sovereignty, democracy, and internal and external security. 

We urge the international community to support Armenia's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and democracy. We will take any step to defend our independence. For this, it is necessary to change, supplement, and enrich Armenia's internal and external security mechanisms, by cooperating with all partners who wish to support us. 

We made the decision to ratify the Rome Statue in December 2022 after it became clear to everyone that the CSTO and our defense agreement with Russia are insufficient for defending Armenia. The ratification of the Rome Statute should not be viewed as a step against Russia. It is necessary for strengthening our defense. It is our sovereign right. 

Armenia must be a peaceful, developed, happy, and democratic state. To get there, we must first reaffirm our will to have an independent and sovereign state, and that is the path we have chosen while respecting [Russia] and while expecting [Russia] to respect our choice as well.  

Will Armenia will be a free and democratic state, or will it become a [remote region of Russia]? Every Armenian citizen must decide now. This is what's at stake [on the streets of Yerevan] today. 

As the prime minister of Armenia, I lead the movement for independence. If I weren't the prime minister, I would have done so as a regular citizen. Armenia's future depends on you and me. //

##interview with Armenia's Parliament President Alen Simonyan || The ceasefire document || Threats from Russia

**REPORTER:** Are you in touch with the Nagorno-Karabakh government?

**ALEN:** Frequently. Although they have long been independent of us.  

**REPORTER:** Your colleague from Nagorno-Karabakh says Pashinyan was informed beforehand about the [September 9] presidential election in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**ALEN:** Obviously information was transferred but Stepanakert didn't even ask for advice. It was for informational purposes only. We all understood that the process organized in Stepanakert would be viewed as a provocation by Baku, but the former regime decided to proceed anyway.

**REPORTER:** The Nagorno-Karabakh government also claims Pashinyan was informed about the NK-AZ ceasefire agreement in advance.

**ALEN:** They showed us the document but we didn't have any input. Over the phone, Pashinyan had expressed his concern and called it unacceptable that a paragraph was included about the supposed presence of soldiers from Armenia. The Nagorno-Karabakh government responded by saying that they don't plan on signing it - it will be a statement only. 

**REPORTER:** Did Pashinyan warn Stepanakert not to change the president because that would destabilize the situation?

**ALEN:** We did not make any demands that could be perceived as a forceful intervention. Nagorno-Karabakh was already aware of the situation very well. It was actually them who informed us about Azerbaijani threats. Nagorno-Karabakh had a more frequent and direct contact with Azerbaijan with the help of peacekeepers. 

**REPORTER:** People who organized the resignation of the Nagorno-Karabakh president are currently protesting on the streets of Yerevan, calling for Pashinyan's resignation.

**ALEN:** The organizers of these protests are foreign forces. But our compatriots have already rejected them. That's why the protests attract only 5,000 participants. I respect the participants but I'd like to urge them not to become a tool in the hands of a 3rd country [Russia] who doesn't have Armenia's interests in mind. Russia needs Turkey and its economic routes.

**REPORTER:** What happened near Nagorno-Karabakh's Khtsaberd village shortly after the 2020 ceasefire?

**ALEN:** In line with the Nov. 9 statement, Armenian forces remained in their positions in a strip near Khtsaberd. A few days later, Russian peacekeepers approached and told them to leave the area. These are our soldiers who later became captives. We called the peacekeepers to understand what was happening. They made some confusing statements and claimed the order to leave was given by Armenians. We requested the names. They didn't provide any. Many of these soldiers are still held captive in Azerbaijan.

That was just one incident in which Russia didn't help Armenia despite there not being any Prague or Brussels meetings yet. It's just an excuse not to help. The Russian media is peddling a misleading narrative to blame Armenia for everything.

It is our government's fault for putting up with their repeated excuses for 3 years, begging them for 3 years, and losing lands and soldiers for 3 years while attempting to sort things out with them. You can't blame us now for taking alternative measures to defend our country.

Russia is attempting to legitimize Azerbaijan's aggression against Armenia proper. When Azerbaijan attacked Nagorno-Karabakh on September 19th, Russia released a statement calling for Azerbaijan and Armenia to exercise restraint. Do you understand what they are trying to do? They are attempting to frame Armenia as a party in that war so they can legitimize Azerbaijan's future attack on Armenia. What SIDES are they talking about? Your peacekeepers are stationed there, witnessing how people are being murdered in 15 directions. Azerbaijan launched the aggression with artillery strikes in 15 directions. 

**REPORTER:** What is the current situation on the AM-AZ border? There were reports of large Azerbaijani accumulations earlier this month.

**ALEN:** Part of their soldiers have been pulling back. The situation is de-escalating.

**REPORTER:** [about EU border observers]

**ALEN:** We invited EU observers on the AM-AZ border after Azerbaijan's aggression [and Russia's refusal to help]. The observers helped to sharply de-escalate the situation. I'd like to thank the countries that sent the observers.

My Russian colleague, the Speaker of the Russian Duma, later met the Azeri counterpart and openly announced that countries that invite European observers cease to exist. It was an open threat by a ranking Russian official against Armenia. //

A truck carrying small quantities of food and blankets entered via Agdam on Tuesday and reached the capital Stepanakert with the permission of the newly elected Nagorno-Karabakh government and Azerbaijani government. Russia hopes that the Lachin corridor will also open soon and work parallel to Agdam.

The Lachin corridor, the lifeline connecting to Armenia, remains closed to Armenian and French aid and the unobstructed passage of civilians despite the orders by the World Court for Azerbaijan to open it.

The Azerbaijani government has stated that, after holding talks with the U.S. and others, they will support the idea of opening the Lachin and Agdam roads simultaneously for Armenian and Azerbaijani Red Cross aid. The approval of the Russian Red Cross to send a truck today is unrelated to the main issue, which is the entry of Armenian and Azerbaijani Red Cross trucks via Lachin and Agdam.

It is unclear whether Azerbaijan will also allow the unobstructed movement of civilians, a demand made by the World Court and Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, many of whom have relatives trapped on the other side of the border, school and business ties in Armenia, all of which have become inaccessible due to Azerbaijan's illegal blockade of the corridor.

Azerbaijan has also shut down the gas and electricity in Nagorno-Karabakh for several months, forcing ethnic Armenians to use wood to survive the winter. There is not enough fuel to deliver essential goods to residents in the regions. 

Kindergartens are shutting down. Water is delivered in buckets. The garbage is not being collected. Food is strictly rationed by the government and involves lengthy queues.

##U.S. reiterates: Lachin and Agdam must open simultaneously

##Vladimir Putin downplays the crisis in Armenia-Russia relations: We have great relations with Armenia and PM Pashinyan 

Putin said that for 10-15 years they've tried to convince the Armenian governments to hand over 5 of the 7 surrounding regions to Azerbaijan but the Armenian side chose to ""fight"".

This contradicts other Russian officials' claims and the history of the negotiations because Azerbaijan was the one that rejected the surrender of 5 regions in exchange for an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh.

Putin also stated that the status of Nagorno-Karabakh has already been settled because Armenia recognizes Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, and that the remaining issues are around the humanitarian situation and the mandate of peacekeeping forces. 

Putin said there is also the issue of not allowing ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh. He ""hopes"" that the Azerbaijani government will ""keep its word"" and prevent ethnic cleansings. *[just like the Nov. 9 promises?]*

Putin blamed Armenia for the Lachin blockade: *""Armenia has recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan.""* Read Armenia's response to this accusation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/166ppv0/armenia_accuses_russia_of_ignoring_commitments/). Armenia says Russia is simply looking for excuses to deflect the blame because it ignores its own Nov. 9 obligations around Lachin.

##Kremlin propagandist threatens to invade Armenia and Georgia to open a corridor to Iran

Context: Armenia and the U.S. are holding joint military exercises for peacekeepers.

**SOLOVYOV VLADIMIR:** Iran will not tolerate the presence of U.S. forces in Armenia. I won't be surprised if Iran surprises Pashinyan with a harsh response. //

Related: After Armenia invited Western observers to monitor the AM-AZ border due to Russia's refusal to follow its contractual obligations, Iran explicitly stated that it doesn't mind the presence of these NATO-state observers in Armenia. 

Solovyov also expressed hope that Georgia and Armenia would burst into flames and fall, giving Russia a land corridor to Iran. 

**SOLOVYOV:** We won't stop in Tbilisi [Georgia] this time. If they [take away the South Caucasus from us], we won't have another option, we will have to go until the end, it will be military action like you've never seen before.

##15 French cities have officially recognized the Artsakh Republic
 
15 mayors released a joint statement of their recognition of Artsakh and urged the French government to follow suit.
 
**The message:** Azerbaijan involved Syrian jihadists and caused a humanitarian crisis in Artsakh, in violation of international conventions. The capital and other settlements were bombarded. Civilians were killed. Thousands had to flee.
 
Although the November 10th agreement isn't favorable, it put an end to the bloodshed. Artsakh's land losses can lead to critically bad conditions for Artsakh's historical-cultural monuments from the 4th, 8th, and 10th centuries.
 
France cannot hide behind a neutral stance anymore. That would mean supporting the Azeri aggression. We need to reaffirm our full support to the friendly people and support their return to their ancestral lands.
 
Artsakh held elections in 1991 and chose independence and has ever since been able to provide internal stability with institutes and democratic processes. Having completed all the components of a state recognized by international law, Artsakh must be recognized as a sovereign state that belongs to the Artsakh people.

##UN about the terrorists hired by Azerbaijan
 
""UN Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries"" released a statement. They are concerned about the mercenaries hired by Azerbaijan and called for their removal. Armenian HR Ombudsman's office has been in touch with the UN office since October 3rd to provide evidence about mercenaries.
 
The UN office is also concerned about Turkey's role in recruiting the mercenaries from Syria, noting that these mercenaries are likely linked to groups with a record of human rights abuses in Syria.
 
The UN office sent a letter to Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Syria.
 
Armenia's HR Ombudsman's office believes it's important to have international bodies acknowledge the fact of the hired mercenaries' presence and the crimes committed by them.

##European Parliament MP calls for international tribunal over AZ-TR aggression
 
**European Parliament MP Ivan David:** a genocide was committed in Karabakh. I've seen a video recorded by Azeris themselves on how they killed civilians and POWs. They also destroyed civilian infrastructure, which is a war crime.
 
Europe looked and did nothing. Some European states supplied weapons to the barbarian wing to secure its victory, all in the name of petrodollars. Europe kneeled before Azeri oil.
 
The youth will eventually wonder why they should answer for the dirty actions of today's administration. They will decide what Europe's mission is in this world.
 
Thankfully, there are many in Europe who realize the situation. They understand that Turkey's ultimate goal is to conquer Europe.
 
There should be an international tribunal to investigate Karabakh events. Let's see how the European Parliament responds to it. Our Identity & Democracy party members also support it. If none of the major three parties vetoes it, it will be discussed in the European Parliament.

##Dutch Parliament resolution
 
The Dutch Parliament approved a resolution to suggest the Dutch government to impose 5 sanctions against the leaders of Turkey and Azerbaijan, against AZ-TR war crime perpetrators, and a suspension of weapon sales to Turkey.

##the army general gives context and details before and during the war
 
**Armenian Army's General Chief of Staff Onik Gasparyan released a statement [he, along with Artsakh's army commanders, were in charge]:** the soldiers fought selflessly from the very beginning. Certain public figures claim that the army command mislead the government with wrong analysis by under-estimating the opponent's capabilities. This is false.
 
I took the office on June 8th and presented the Security Council and the PM my analysis of the regional military-political situation. I suggested improving the army. This was my analysis:
 
1) Azerbaijan is no longer our only opponent. Turkey is involved. We cannot resist their combined aggression. We need political steps to prevent a war.
 
2) The government accepted my advice and asked ""If we cannot avoid a war politically, what can be done?"". My answer was ""we'd need to deal a heavy blow on the enemy troops as quickly as possible and force them to end their hostifilites"". I noted that Armenia needs to avoid lengthy wars due to a lack of resources. We discussed many ways to improve our army; the suggestions were accepted.
 
3) We also discussed the plans to create the new Volunteer Army consisted of 100,000 people.
 
We were unable to avoid the war which led to a much larger enemy's aggression on September 27th. We were dealing heavy blows and repelling the opponent, but we were also sustaining heavy casualties.
 
On the 4th day, I presented our losses and suggested ending the was within 3 days, otherwise, if the intensity of the battles remained the same, our resources would expire quickly and we'd have worse negotiation terms.
 
Our attempts to stop the war were rejected by Turkey and Azerbaijan. and we were forced to continue the war. We attempted to cause heavy damage to the enemy to convince them to stop and to return to the negotiation table.
 
The unfavorable Document was signed after a comprehensive assessment of the situation. We had to choose between ""very bad"" and ""tragedy"". We chose the lesser of the evil.
 
We shouldn't be depressed now, knowing that we saved part of Artsakh and the army's main potential. We need to regroup and prepare to continue the struggle.
 
As the general commander, I carry responsibility for all successes and failures of our army. We were forced into a brutal war but our soldiers fought until the end despite the unequal forces. The nation should be proud of its soldier.
  
&nbsp
 
**OP David's personal analysis:** back in June, even before the July battles, [Azerbaijan was already boasting](https://www.trtworld.com/turkey/azerbaijan-to-purchase-combat-drones-from-turkey-37493) about importing Turkish Bayraktar drones. The Armenian army knew that Turkey was plotting something. Onik Gasparyan predicted Turkey's possible involvement even before the drone news reached the media.
 
When the war began, the army told Pashinyan that they’ll try to force Azeris to stop by inflicting heavy casualties. Pashinyan made multiple public speeches reflecting the army's strategy, saying ""we must stop this war by forcing Azeris to return to negotiating table"".
 
The army was concerned about the severity of the war in the first week, and wanted to stop within 3 days, but possibly revised the decision when the intensity subsided down afterward. The army has stated many times that the battles weren't as heavy anymore. The army decided to keep fighting to force Azeris to stop and return to the negotiation table.
 
At this time, Armenians could have accepted a defeat and give 7 regions to Azerbaijan, but they thought they could force Azeris to be the ones to stop first, so Armenia would have a better negotiating power.

When Armenians realized they can't succeed, they decided to give the regions, but by then, Azerbaijan also demanded Shushi, so Armenians said ""if we're gonna lose it all then we might as well fight and try to keep Shushi"". Fast forward to Shushi. Armenians lost the city and were forced to sign the ceasefire to prevent further loss.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1035102.html
 
 
 
##Vladimir Putin gives more details about Shushi / negotiations / Pashinyan
 
While the war was happening in the south, Russia asked Pashinyan if it's OK to [essentially repopulate] Shushi by bringing the Azeri refugees who used to live there [Shushi area was heavily populated by Azeris during USSR]. Shushi would de-jure remain under Artsakh control but Azeri civilians would be settled there. Pashinyan rejected the offer on security grounds. Putin and Aliyev were in favor of that deal.
 
""Pashinyan told me that he sees a direct threat to Artsakh interests [with Azeri population in Shushi] although I don't understand what the threat would be,"" said Putin. 

&nbsp;

""The agreement was drafted and signed within a day. Every word and every comma was being debated."" *[there goes all the conspiracy theories that Nikol knew ahead of time, Nikol already brought peacekeepers x days ago, yadda yadda]*
 
&nbsp;
 
Putin denied the claim that he has bad relations with Pashinyan and that it lead to this situation. ""I haven't noticed any problems with relations with Armenia in recent times, including in the period when Pashinyan became the Prime Minister.""
 
&nbsp;
 
""If Armenia walked back the signed document, that would be a suicide.""

""Allegations of treason by Pashinyan are baseless,"" he added.
 
&nbsp;
 
""The status of Nagorno Karabakh hasn't been clarified. Moscow preserves the status quo. If good relations are established between Armenia and Azerbaijan, it will be possible to solve the Status issue.""
 
""When the Georgian government attacked our peacekeepers, Russia recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. We also recognized the fair aspiration of the Crimean population to join Russia, so we recognized it, we supported them openly. We did that for the best interest of the Crimean residents and Russia. In the case of Karabakh, this did not happen, which certainly had a significant impact on what has happened,"" said Putin. [does Vlad want Karabakh?]

##November 17 / political turmoil continues
 
**10:48:** oppo BHK party wants today's Parliamentary session to be only about Pashinyan's resignation and the suspension of the ongoing Martial Law. Oppo LHK wants to hold a new session specifically for lifting the Martial Law.
 
There were very few ruling QP MPs, too, so no voting was held despite some Q&As. The Finance Minister spoke about dedicating funds for Artsakh refugees.
 
&nbsp;
 
During the session, ruling QP MP Andranik Kocharyan called for Defense Minister Tonoyan's resignation, criticizing him and another defense official who has already been fired. The MP listed several ""mistakes by the military between 2016-2020"".
 
The MP has been heavily criticizing certain army officials since yesterday. He was asked to clarify if he recently ""terrorized"" a Colonel during a meeting. The MP responded:

""Terrorize who? That so-called Colonel Koryun Yeghiazaryan, whom I refer to as Serj's Koryun, who used to be Vazgen Manukyan's chauffeur and used to terrorize the public? President Serj Sargsyan liked them so much that made them part of his administration.
 
These and several militarymen were ruling the country. We've seen videos of HHK MP Shmays, along with the said Colonel, choking demonstrators. They have no quality. They weren't sent to retirement because of 'connections'.
 
Yesterday I met the Colonel. He was asked about the weapons under his possession. I asked him which positions he commanded during the war.""

**The SIS responded:** Gegham Manukyan told his supporters during a rally that our agents allegedly kept them in a station just for the sake of not allowing them to participate in a rally. This is false. He and several others were invited for questioning. They were asked questions about their ongoing case. 
 
We urge media outlets not to spread misinformation. For example, hayeli.am [Roboserj] uploaded photos and claimed 13 investigators resigned. In reality, the agents continue to do their duties.

##telecom and airways reform in Armenia / TV outlets competing for slots
 
Earlier this year, the government approved a law to regulate hateful/gore content on public TV, to require news outlets to present both sides of the story, etc. It also prioritizes Armenian-language content broadcasted over the free public airways.
 
In order for foreign outlets to continue to broadcast foreign-language content for free, they have to negotiate on certain terms. Today the TV regulator negotiated with Russia and signed an agreement to allocate 1-2 public airway slots for Russian channels.
 
Foreign TV channels do not have to compete. They receive a fixed slot per interstate agreement.
 
Overall, Armenian TV outlets are competing for 25 airway frequency slots: 12 outlets are competing for 6 countrywide slots, 4 are competing for 9 slots in Yerevan, 13 competing for 10 slots in provinces.
 
The winners will be known in January. ""The process is apolitical and those who provide the best programming will win the slots,"" said TV Regulator Tigran Hakobyan. 

Today six outlets will present their programming: TV5, ArmNews, H2, Kentron, Armenia, ATV. *[Most, if not all, are either fully or partly owned by the former regime's oligarchs].*

3/28/2023,Analysis: Armenia violates the agreements it signed after the 2nd Karabakh War,"Armenia has been carrying out military shipments to Karabakh for a while, violating the tripartite agreements signed after the 2nd Karabakh War.

According to the tripartite agreements signed by the leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia after the 2nd Karabakh War, there should be no armed units belonging to Armenia in Karabakh, but by continuing its military shipments to Karabakh, Armenia is behaving in violation of the agreements.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b69zciyp4bqa1.jpg?width=864&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9339e8699f80e624c1e198b9c15727106f7cec2b

&#x200B;

The increase in the transportation of manpower, ammunition, mines and military equipment from Armenia to the illegal Armenian armed groups in the territory of Azerbaijan, where the Russian forces are temporarily deployed, caused reactions in Azerbaijan.

&#x200B;

The Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan, by explaining the violations committed by the Armenians in Karabakh, day by day, showed its reaction and gave warnings.

&#x200B;

Since the only route known as the Lachin Corridor, which is the only route used by the Armenian population in Azerbaijan on their way to and from Armenia, is only open to civilian passages due to the protests of Azerbaijani environmentalists, Armenian forces are trying to make military shipments through mountain roads and to build new roads in mountainous areas.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvg25bts4bqa1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d84f80652ac11616cfe1ce2ae01e730da2ddcb6e

&#x200B;

As violations increased in March, clashes and loss of life occurred between the parties.

&#x200B;

On March 5, upon the information that military equipment, ammunition and personnel were transported from Armenia to the territories of Azerbaijan, where the Armenian population lives, using the Hankendi-Halfeli-Turşsu road, Azerbaijani soldiers took action.

&#x200B;

Clashes broke out after those in the vehicle opened fire on the Azerbaijani soldiers who wanted to stop the illegal military transport vehicle for control. In the conflict, 2 soldiers of the Azerbaijani army were martyred. The Armenian side announced that 3 police officers were killed in the clash.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w4d27vwx4bqa1.jpg?width=1562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=379f70e7642e9c9e0ada0ef5e2f4620a7cbf7ed1

&#x200B;

On March 7, military vehicles belonging to the Armenian armed forces and illegal Armenian armed groups, accompanied by Russian forces, made a shipment through Khankendi-Halfeli-Turşsu.

&#x200B;

On the same route, on March 11, Armenian forces accompanied the Russian forces. The shipment was recorded by the unmanned aerial vehicles of the Azerbaijani army.

&#x200B;

On March 21, the Ministry announced that Armenian forces carried out military shipments via Khankendi-Halfeli-Turşsu and announced that the responsibility for the tensions to be experienced in this situation lies with the Yerevan administration.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On March 24, it was determined that Armenian forces made a new road in the direction of Khankendi-Kosalar-Mirzeler-Turşsu to the north of the Khankendi-Halfeli-Turşsu road, and Azerbaijan also warned in this regard. In the warning, it was noted that the Russian troops in the region did not fulfill their obligations.

&#x200B;

When the warnings were not taken into account, Azerbaijan took some measures to prevent illegal armed forces in Karabakh from transporting manpower and weapons by using some dirt roads. Azerbaijani soldiers set up checkpoints on dirt roads where illegal shipments were made.

&#x200B;

In the statements made by Azerbaijan, Armenia was demanded to end its illegal activities in Karabakh, and the Russian forces were also asked to fulfill their obligations.

https://preview.redd.it/sx2srw835bqa1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddacbbeaa7b3f93636c0106a1e719819c445e281

&#x200B;

Azerbaijan wants a checkpoint to be established on the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia, at the last point of the Lachin road, in order to prevent illegal activities in its territory.

##opposition accuses Defense Ministry of shady arms deal / Latter denies & provides details 
 
The opposition activists shared a document on the internet and claimed Minister of Defense Tonoyan supplied weapons to Turkey and the Syrian terrorists, among other shady contracts.
 
**MoD responded:** yesterday, certain media outlets circulated a coordinated lie to discredit the Ministry.
 
1) The document claims the MoD used a middleman to sell weapons to Turkey which was then used by terrorists hired from Syria. This is a complete lie. The document is being presented in a way to manipulate and build a narrative.
 
2) It claims MoD gave $3.5m to a middleman with friendly ties with Minister Davit Tonoyan. This is a lie. The money was given to a foreign arms company, through the middleman, with the purpose of ensuring that Armenia continues to receive weapons. 

Moreover, the foreign arms supplier had already supplied some of the weapons, the value of which was above what we had paid. The $3.5m mentioned in the document is a fraction of the total arms deal.
 
It's strange that this document was leaked now. We gave it to another government agency for examination in 2018. *[they are possibly hinting that former NSS chief Arthur Vanetsyan obtained this document in 2018 and circulated it today as retaliation for his arrest]*
 
3) The rumor claims that certain individuals offered MoD to buy bulletproof vests from Russia for $300 but the MoD rejected it and used another seller to buy it for $1,000 apiece.
 
This is an obvious and impudent lie. The MoD purchases weapons from Russia at the below-market value, per AM-RU agreement. We did not buy the same Russian vests at a higher price.
 
In this particular case, the vests that we purchased, which came with helmets, were in very limited quantities, were purchased from the official Russian government seller, exclusively for special forces troops for complex combat activities. These vests are of higher quality and cost significantly more than what regular troops wear.
 
The MoD condemns the coordinated campaign to manipulate the public with actions that are harmful to national security and demands retraction by media outlets. We expect law enforcement to deal with document leakers.

&nbsp;
 
The Defense Ministry also accused the opposition of twisting MoD Tonoyan's words about drones.
 
**MoD:** after the 2016 April battles, [now-minister] Tonoyan gave an interview during which he spoke about the effectiveness of Israeli-made Harop drones. Yesterday a video was circulated showing strikes made by much more advanced Bayraktar drones. Tonoyan's words were twisted to claim he downplayed Bayraktar's effectiveness.
 
In reality, Tonoyan was talking about Harop drones which are easier to detect or evade due to loud engine noise, etc. Bayraktars fly at a higher altitude and are harder to detect.
 
Moreover, the Israeli Harop drones, just as in 2016 battles, were easily detected and downed during the 2020 war. The army shot ~200 such drones during this war.

##arrests & trials over ""coup & assassination plot""
 
Several arrests were made yesterday over an alleged coup and assassination attempt against PM Pashinyan. A phone call that was made between the suspects was leaked yesterday.
 
A suspect and militaryman Ashot Minasyan, who is accused of smuggling weapons from Artsakh, will remain in jail for 2 months pre-trial, after the court found his arrest justified. He was a participant in the leaked call. He denies wrongdoing.
 
Another suspect is ex-NSS chief Arthur Vanetsyan. He was also arrested and charged yesterday. The court found his pre-trial arrest unjustified and released him. He was not a participant of the leaked call, but his name was mentioned by other participants. He denies wrongdoing.
 
Another suspect ex-HHK MP Vahram Baghdasaryan was also charged. Prosecutors asked the court for pre-trial arrest. He is a party in the phone call.

##the political turmoil continues / opposition vs government
 
A Russian-Armenian public figure allied with Armenian opposition claimed that First Lady Anna Hakobyan unnecessarily interfered with the military's work in Artsakh, which resulted in disputes and the ""firing"" of a general.
 
Artsakh president's spokesman Poghosyan wrote then removed a post in which he denied the ""myths"" about Anna Hakobyan participating in Artsakh's Military Council meetings. The general [Movses Hakobyan] who was allegedly ""fired"" after the ""confrontation"" with Anna Hakobyan, had actually traveled to Armenia for COVID treatment, reads Artsakh president spokesman's post.
 
https://factor.am/309887.html
 
Aram A Catholicos has urged unity among Armenians. He urged rejection of the signed document. Praised the army that fought against ""enemies with state-of-the-art weapons"".
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034926.html
 
Pro-Kocharyan opposition activist Artur Danielyan (Adekvad gang/party) was released from jail. His office was searched and computers were confiscated. He believes it's over a Livestream he made earlier.
 
https://news.am/arm/news/613562.html
 
Opposition figures said they have information about a threat against their lives by ""armed groups allied with the government"". The police asked for more information to launch an investigation.
 
https://news.am/arm/news/613561.html
 
Opposition ARF and several of its international branches have called for the government's resignation.
 
https://news.am/arm/news/613492.html , https://news.am/arm/news/613493.html
 
The names of 51 more deceased soldiers were published, bringing the total identified to 1434. The army has the bodies of 2317 soldiers, some of whom are yet to be identified. Simultaneously, the process of exchanging bodies with Azerbaijan continues and the number is likely to rise.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034912.html , https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034918.html
 
 
Armenian withdrawal from the north-western Qarvachar region has been postponed from November 15th to November 25th. The withdrawal process has slowed down in other regions as well due to weather and de-mining activities.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034923.html , https://news.am/arm/news/613518.html
 
Healthcare Minister Torosyan met and thanked the Armenian and foreign doctors who have been helping the wounded soldiers throughout the war.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034937.html
 
The Supreme Court president has urged all the judges to remain neutral, free from government or opposition influence, and to do their duties.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1034942.html
 
The opposition held a rally earlier and brought a group of soldiers, presenting them as their allies, and as being ""real fighters unlike Pashinyan's puppets who wear uniforms and make videos claiming to support Pashinyan"".
 
One of the soldiers, brought by the opposition, later came forward, saying he was duped by BHK Naira Zohrabyan. ""Our unit was told we were being taken to outposts but they brought us to [opposition rally] and presented us as frontline defenders. I didn't know what was happening. We aren't frontline soldiers. I apologize to my fellow soldiers in front lines.""
 
https://youtu.be/3ku3pVkk8g4?t=26
 
 
##Flashback October 8th / commander tells soldiers to ""leave positions, this war is a conspiracy pre-planned by the govt""
 
**Pashinyan wrote on October 8th**: A few days ago I was alerted that someone in the front lines goes around and tells soldiers that ""go, leave your positions, Pashinyan has already sold the lands, this was a conspired war. There is no point in guarding the positions. You're here to be used as cannon fodder to cover up the pre-planned conspiracy.
 
According to sources, the soldiers were even ordered to leave their positions. I ordered the NSS to investigate. One of the suspects, a Stepanakert resident, was arrested in Yerevan. Not all details are clear. There is a possibility it's a political campaign.
 
I urge all Armenians who have similar info to come forward. The traitors have no place in the ranks of our heroic generals and volunteers.
 
**NSS released details that evening:** the suspect N.M., being the deputy-commander of the communication platoon in [classified] unit, while being in front lines during his duties, decided to collude with the captain to go around and spread false information among the soldiers.
 
They told soldiers that the government - in reality- had pre-planned to give away these lands, so it doesn't make sense to continue to fight. This caused significant damage to their morale and some of them left the positions.
 
**Media writes the same day:** the arrested suspect is [Robert Kocharyan's friend] Vitaly Balasanyan's friend. He had earlier met Kocharyan, Serj Sargsyan, and Arthur Vanetsyan while in Artsakh. We don't know the content of their discussions.

##Artsakh Defense Army chief Arzumanyan speech:
 
Dear compatriots, from Sep-27 to Nov-9 we had to resist the joint aggression by Azerbaijan, Turkey, and their hired terrorists. After 44 days of heavy battles, the Armenian fighters showed acts of heroism, but unfortunately, that wasn't enough to win. The outcome has objective and subjective reasons, which will be analyzed and honest investigation will be carried out.
 
But today we have what we have. Our starting point should be not the dreams we have but the established reality, so we can achieve our dream later. For that, we need unity and a sense of personal responsibility. We need to put an end to the rumors and lies.
 
The truth is, Artsakh exists and will continue to exist. Our army exited the war with heavy wounds but will continue to do its duties more united and disciplined than ever. The army maintained its structure, and the future changes will be done not to dismantle it but to reform it to achieve unprecedented combat effectiveness.
 
Unfounded rumors are unfair to the soldiers who are, first and foremost, still serving to protect the front lines. Their duty is to protect our borders and people's right to live there. Many have sacrificed their lives to achieve this. I am confident we will be worthy of their sacrifice.

##University Network for Human Rights sends its analysis to UN's Genocide Prevention office about the ""risk of ethnic cleansings and possible genocide"" in Nagorno-Karabakh

>The ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, known as Artsakh by Armenians, is under the very real threat of ethnic cleansing and potential genocide. The risk may extend to the southern portion of Armenia as well

...

>Indicator 10.3. Widespread or systematic discriminatory or targeted practices or violence against the lives, freedom or physical and moral integrity of a protected group, even if not yet reaching the
level of elimination.

>Azerbaijan has deployed a series of mutually reinforcing measures that have made life in Nagorno-Karabakh impossible for its 120,000 inhabitants. This situation will result in the mass exodus of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh (assuming Azerbaijan lifts the blockade of the Lachin Corridor and ceases to threaten those who leave with arbitrary detention), the coerced surrender of the self-declared independent republic to subjugation under Azerbaijan, or the slaughter of the Armenians still living in Nagorno-Karabakh

...

>investigations also strongly suggest that Azerbaijani officials have condoned, facilitated, and directly perpetrated enforced disappearances tied to arbitrary detentions and the use of secret detention

...

>Resort to methods or practices of violence that dehumanize a protected group, that reveal an intention to cause humiliation, fear or terror to fragment the group, or that reveal an intention to change its identity: Azerbaijani forces filmed and/or photographed the bodies of civilians and combatants who had been extrajudicially killed or killed in action, including bodies that had been mutilated. Practices include
chopping off limbs, carving messages across torsos, exposing victims’ genitals and breasts

>Families of prisoners of war have described receiving video messages of their loved ones being forced to dance naked while in captivity.

>Azerbaijan opened a Military Trophy Park after its victory in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War featuring grotesque and degrading statues of defeated Armenians.

>Azerbaijan began producing a commemorative stamp showing a split-screen image of an Azerbaijani soldier and a man in a chemical biohazard suit standing over a map of Azerbaijan and fumigating the area of Nagorno-Karabakh.

...

>our concern that a trigger could escalate the crisis at any moment has compelled us to present this submission to you sooner rather than later. It is our hope that your expertise can enrich and inform our risk analysis, identify opportunities to mitigate key risk factors, and help alert the international community to the gravity of the threat facing Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians.

##EU releases a statement on the blockade of the Lachin corridor after a meeting of the EU Committee of Ministers:

(1) The continued movement restrictions and the humanitarian and security consequences affecting the Karabakh Armenians concern us.

(2) Partial blockade since December. No movement of food or medicine starting June. People don't have essential goods.

(3) We call for the full resumption of Red Cross activities. Its activities have been heavily hampered.

(4) Respect the Nov. 9 Trilateral Statement, the ECHR interim measures, and the World Court order. Ensure the free and secure movement along the Lachin corridor.

(5) We have taken note of Azerbaijan's readiness to supply goods via Agdam. We strongly believe the Lachin corridor must be unblocked, in line with past agreements and the World Court Order.

(6,7) We're watching the AM-AZ border. 

(8,10) Hold negotiations between AM-AZ and NK-AZ as soon as possible.

(9) We have a guy who's ready to help resolve the humanitarian issues. 

(11) AM and AZ have reaffirmed their full respect for each other's territorial integrity. Now delimit the borders. 

(12) Don't spew hatred. Commit to dialogue in good faith. Resolve humanitarian issues to trust.

(13) EU is really good, admit it.

##U.S. State Department: Let food enter Nagorno-Karabakh, open the Lachin corridor 

**Spokesman:** We are going to remain deeply engaged in this process. We are deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh resulting from the continued blockage of food, medicine, and other essential goods. 

The U.S. has worked continuously with the sides over the past several weeks to allow humanitarian assistance to reach the population of Nagorno-Karabakh, and we reiterate our call to immediately reopen the Lachin corridor to humanitarian, commercial, and passenger traffic as well.

Russia had earlier warned Armenia against ratifying the Rome Statute. The Armenian government delayed the ratification but eventually decided to proceed with it. 

**KHANDANYAN, ruling party MP:** It is Armenia's sovereign decision to ratify the Rome Statute. Armenia does not owe an explanation to any party on why it joins this international mechanism. The Rome Statute is an important document. Armenia's recognition of ICC will serve as an additional security mechanism.

**REPORTER:** Is there a chance it might not pass in parliament?

**KHANDANYAN**: It needs to be discussed and voted on in parliament. It hasn't even gone through the preliminary committee process yet.

There are multiple reports that Armenia will also deliver humanitarian aid to Ukraine this month. The news was picked up by multiple popular Russian opposition outlets which accused Putin of bringing NATO closer to Russia (Scandinavia) and losing the remaining allies. 

They noted that Armenia refused to host CSTO military training earlier this year but will hold one with the U.S. next week.

##Armenia will acquire a 5-storey building in downtown London to upgrade its tiny embassy 

The Armenian embassy in the UK, which occupies an area size of a 2br apartment, is being evicted by the landlord. *It's complicated.* 

The government has decided to upgrade its presence by acquiring a 5-storey building worth $22 million. They want you to know that they were able to bazaar their way into an $800,000 discount.

The old area has always significantly limited the possibilities of the embassy, said the government. The new embassy will be located near the embassies of other countries, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, UK's foreign ministry building, etc.

##Maybe Kremlin enjoys being humiliated? || How Serj swindled EU || Armenia's relations with Russia & CSTO

Interview with analyst Hovsep Khurshudyan.

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan complained about Russia's inaction. Russia's foreign ministry responded sharply. 

**KHURSHUDYAN:** You know what's strange? Azerbaijan has been constantly humiliating Russia with impunity. It sent aid to Ukraine, its former ambassador called ethnic Russians ""pigs"", its new ambassador to Ukraine praised the Ukrainian army and how they are destroying Russian forces, etc. Have you heard a single complaint from Russia? It's as if they are enjoying the humiliation. 

But when Armenia takes minor steps to strengthen its sovereignty and simply brings up the fact that Russia isn't following the agreements, and when Armenia finally decides to send humanitarian aid to Ukraine, suddenly that's a major scandal for the Kremlin.

Earlier this week a guy from a private organization [unrelated to NATO] urged Armenia to join NATO. Russia's state media picked up on that and spread false claims about Armenia receiving an invitation to join NATO. The entire Russian state press has turned yellow. *""Don't you dare to join NATO.""*

This is pathological. Armenia is a tiny slave for them. A slave who must forever whine under their feet and not have any sovereignty. This is necessary so they can continue to sell parts of Armenia while simultaneously gaslighting Armenians to come and beg them for help.  

I'm happy that we've finally decided to send aid to Ukraine, to acknowledge that Russia isn't our ally anymore, and to ratify the Rome Statute. The latter isn't a step against Russia. Its purpose is to turn the war criminal Ilham Aliyev into a Milosevich.

Things Russia can't/won't do: Supply weapons, follow the AM-RU defense agreements, and be an ally.

Things Russia can do: Raise the energy prices, suppress AM-RU trade, and activate its 5th column within Armenia. 

What will happen if Armenia leaves the Russian sphere for good?

(1) The 5th column knows they'll be dealing with authorities if they try anything illegal. 

(2) The gas price could increase but at least we would have wider access to Western military tech. Armenia would become more interesting for foreign investors.

(3) Trade. Only ~30% of our actual trade is with Russia. We have the ability to increase trade with Europe. Armenia is ahead of the Association states Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine with its parameters and is actually closer to the EU than them. This is the second time Germany is urging Armenia to apply for the EU. We could replace Russia with the EU and Iran.

And it's a big ""if"" whether Russia would actually shut down trade with Armenia. They need Armenia's trade more than ever. Certain types of products are being imported to Russia via Armenia today. Armenia must use this as leverage to strengthen its sovereignty. 

**REPORTER:** Why did Pashinyan snap at Kremlin *now*?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Not now, but in September 2022, when Russia officially betrayed Armenia by ignoring its defense obligations. The topic of leaving CSTO and inviting EU monitors was placed on the agenda in 2022. Russia didn't like the presence of the EU.

Did I miss CSTO's condemnation of Azerbaijan's border attack last week? Did they even make a statement? This time Armenia didn't even bother to apply to CSTO. That's good. It's a pointless butaforie structure. But CSTO should have responded with a statement even without Armenia's application. 

Russia and Armenia must gradually learn to live apart. Russia must realize that Armenia is a sovereign state and not a puppet.  

**REPORTER:** How will the ratification of the Rome Statute affect Armenia's relations with Putin?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** Forget about Putin. We need to ratify it for our own people. Putin's MOD Sergey Shoygu accidentally let it slip that the 2020 war was a ""brilliant operation with our Turkish partners"".  

Our previous leaders allowed this to happen by launching the Tatarstanization of Armenia. What was the Serj administration's response when Russia began selling $4 billion worth of weapons to Azerbaijan? What was the Kocharyan administration's response to Russia's $300 million sale of S-300 to Azerbaijan? 

Russia spat on our faces, while our leaders claimed ""It's raining"". That was our foreign policy then. Their argument was that it's actually good that Russia is selling weapons to Azerbaijan because it's better Russia than someone else, ""it's just business"". They were justifying Russia's decision to arm our enemy. A new level of self-deception was fed to the public. 

The next step was taking us to the EAEU, and signing protocols in CSTO in 2010 to prevent the deployment of third-party troops in Armenia. Armenia did not demand anything in exchange for that paragraph. Our government ignored our plea to demand the addition of the second paragraph to prohibit Russia from selling weapons to CSTO member Armenia's enemy Azerbaijan. They didn't even have the courage to demand that. 

**REPORTER:** Serj rejected the EU document and took us to Russia's EAEU bloc instead. His reasoning was that it would guarantee the security of Nagorno-Karabakh. Did it work?

**KHURSHUDYAN:** It was an attempt to fool the public. Armenia already had all sorts of defense agreements with Russia. If Russia was an ally, that should have been enough. Did our EAEU membership prevent the sale of Russian weapons to Azerbaijan? Of course not. The only thing we got was Europe recognizing Armenia as an ""occupant"". 

Europe fell for Serj's scheme and was betrayed at the last moment when he decided to join the Russian bloc instead. Prior to that, Europe was intentionally ignoring Serj's anti-democratic conduct and falsifications. They allowed Serj's dictatorship to flourish as long as they thought Serj was going to be their ally. It was dishonorable. Serj swindled them. 

This was followed by the European Parliament adopting a resolution recognizing Armenia as an occupant. So were you surprised by EU's indifference during the 2020 war? 

Thank goodness the government is attempting to correct those mistakes today by moving us away from the Russian bloc. The Russian military base on the AM-TR border should be shut down as well. We do have the ability to guard the border with Turkey. In case you didn't know, half of the Russian base soldiers are local ethnic Armenians. Possibly the majority of the AM-TR border is guarded by Armenians today.

##update: French embassy denies rumors about Macron's visit to Armenia 

Rumors were circulated by Armenian and Azerbaijani outlets claiming that Macron might visit Yerevan and Baku this weekend. He will not.

Armenian analysts (on Chibukhchyan Live) suspected that it might be an information operation by Azeri agents to spread disinformation, hype something up, and then leave Armenians disappointed. The suspicions are possibly true, except the source of the disinformation was allegedly Kremlin-backed media figures and not Azeris. 

**Ukrainian researcher:** The source of this information was the ""Aphla News"" outlet operated by Kremlin propagandists with the aim of targeting the Armenian diaspora living in the West. //

It should be noted that there is no conclusive evidence of this yet.

##Azerbaijan threatens Armenia: if you do not give me a Zangezur corridor right now, I'll take my business elsewhere and get a road via Iran instead

Context: Armenia and Azerbaijan signed an agreement on Nov. 9, 2020, to open regional communications passing through Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia would gain railway and road access to Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, while Azerbaijan would gain railway and road access to Nekhijevan and Turkey via Armenia. 

Armenia agreed to implement the project and proposed a plan to install customs to regulate the trade. Azerbaijan intentionally misinterpreted the agreement and demanded the road to be essentially a sovereign corridor instead. This was against the agreement so Armenia refused despite pressure and Azerbaijan's military attacks.

**Azerbaijani government today:** That corridor is one of the elements of the East-West transport route and could increase traffic by 5-8 million tons. It would benefit Armenia, Azerbaijan, and others. 

We have Plan B. We can build this corridor without Armenia's participation. It will be Armenia's loss. //

Azerbaijan and Iran have been discussing the construction of a new route that bypasses Armenia. It will be 5 km south of Armenia. The agreement to build the road was signed last year.

##anti-corruption: former deputy mayor of Yerevan is charged with corruption and causing $7.7 million in damages to the city in a case involving the infamous garbage collector ""Sanitek""

They let the shit pile up so much it finally hit the fan.

**Anti-Corruption Committee:** Ex-deputy mayor Vahe Nikoyan and other municipality employees acted as a group to carry out the scheme. A company had applied to become the trash collector in some districts. They didn't do their duties yet the defendants ignored it and made payments, and then extra payments, to the company. There were also violations during the tender process to choose the company. The garbage company gave a bribe to the deputy mayor's family through a property rental scheme. The events took place in 2015-2016. //

(5) He allowed the illegal construction of his family's 2-storey hotel and fountain. Moreover, he sold the land for a cheap price to the company ""Hin Parvana"" belonging to his family.

(6) Together with other municipal employees, he committed money laundering and sold industrial land to his own company for a cheap price.

(7) He sold a piece of land to himself. It was meant to be a public road and a sidewalk.

##the question of Shushi repopulation during past negotiations
 
**CivilNet's Tatul:** yesterday Putin spoke about an offer made on October 19-20 that would have stopped the war. Aliyev and Putin had agreed to stop the war if Azerbaijan settled its population in Shushi. Pashinyan was against it.
 
Army chief Onik Gasparyan said yesterday, ""On the 4th day I presented our losses and suggested to end the war within 3 days, otherwise, if the intensity of battles remained the same, we would expire our resources quickly and have more unfavorable negotiating leverage.""
 
The question is, why did Pashinyan reject Putin's offer [Azeris in Shushi] if the army gave that analysis?
 
First possibility. Most likely, Pashinyan hoped that it would be possible to defend Shushi militarily, considering its fortress nature and conviction among Armenians that it's hard to capture. Pashinyan was convinced that not only the army could defend Shushi, but also turn the tide on the Shushi outskirts [gyorbagyor gorge].
 
Second possibility. Pashinyan preferred to fight, even at the cost of casualties, rather than agree to let Azeris return to Shushi.
 
There may be other reasons. Only Pashinyan can clarify this. The topic of Azeris returning to Shushi has been an important part of past negotiations. Baku has wanted Shushi resettlement since May-1994.
 
On Dec-1997 the OSCE proposed a phased resolution which was mostly accepted by Armenia's first president Levon Ter-Petrosyan. The document said the following about Shushi: ""the negotiations should clarify the status of Karabakh, and the questions around Lachin, Shushi, and Shahumyan"". Although it doesn't directly mention the return of Azeris to Shushi, it's obvious that the ""question around Shushi"" referred to the Azeri population's return to Shushi.
 
There was also a suggestion for both sides to remove their troops from Shushi and Shahumyan. Civilians would enjoy all civil rights and connection to Azerbaijan and Karabakh.
 
On Nov-1998 a document was proposed specifically about Shushi and Shahumyan: all Azeri refugees would return to Shushi, and the Karabakh govt would ensure their full rights. The same about Armenians returning to Shahumyan.
 
In 2001 in Key West, Armenia agreed for Azeris to return to Shushi. They even discussed a new road connecting southern Fizuli to Shushi.
 
Later, in the Madrid and Kazan documents, the topic of Shushi and Shahumyan wasn't mentioned because these two documents weren't comprehensive resolution packages, but rather ""principles"" for resolution. Shushi and Shahumyan were supposed to be discussed during negotiations, based on those principles.
 
If Armenia was smart since 1997, we would have peace for decades and wouldn't lose Shushi and Hadrut today.

##former MoD official Movses Hakobyan makes accusations / Ministry of Defense response 
 
A fired/resigned general Movses Hakobyan accused PM Pashinyan of not contacting Vladimir Putin and not asking Russia for help before September 30th (war began on 27th).
 
PM's office denied the claim and published media transcripts about conversations held between Pashinyan and Putin on September 27th and 29th.
 
Hakobyan also accused the army and administration of making wrong decisions, unprofessionalism, and being unprepared.
 
""The rest of the accusations made by Hakobyan against Pashinyan during Hakobyan's press conference were just as inaccurate. We view it under the context of a deliberate false report against the PM. The latter will address it when necessary,"" said PM's office
 
&nbsp;
 
Hakobyan made several other claims:  
 
He didn't like that Pashinyan fired him as the head of General Staff. He considers the new head Artsak Davtyan to be incompetent; Hakobyan had offered another replacement instead of Davtyan. He views the day when Davtyan was appointed as the ""beginning of the crumbling of the army"".
 
He claims there was little or no retreat in locations where the regular army defended the borders.
 
Claims there were big problems during war preparations.
 
Claims the government stopped the army replenishment on the 3rd day and instructed volunteers to go to front lines without proper equipment. ""This led to 1,500 troops routing by the 5th day of the war.""
 
Claims Iskander weapon was used but won't say when.
 
Claims Polye-21 weapon was imported which jammed Bayraktars for 4 days but Turkey found a workaround by tweaking control.
 
Claims Artsakh president Arayik Harutyunyan is correct about NSS forces refusing to help to protect north-eastern borders, but agrees with the soldiers' decision not to help, saying they weren't prepared for trench warfare.

 
&nbsp;
 
Hakobyan refused to take questions from the Azatutyun media outlet, calling them bad for Armenia.
 
Hakobyan's nephew is Armen Grigoryan, who is Pashinyan's Security Council secretary. ""In the past, when I was a public official, Armen was leading a campaign of an opposition [anti-Serj, presumably] politician. I couldn't change his mind at the time. He is an adult, I don't want to interfere with his decisions,"" said Hakobyan.

&nbsp;
 
The Ministry of Defense released a statement accusing Hakobyan of making statements some of which are false, while others containing top-secret information including about Armenia's international arms contracts, ""revelation of which puts national security at risk"".
 

**MoD statement:** // Hakobyan, who served as MoD's head of Logistics Department for a brief period, who had placed his signature under international weapon contracts that were formed as a result of agreements between governments of Armenia and other states, is now attempting to create the impression that the weapons which were effective during this war were purchased only while he was in charge.
 
That is false. Even if his signature is under some documents, that doesn't mean the negotiations to obtain those weapons started under his command. Moreover, some of the weapons mentioned by Hakobyan are being purchased regularly and aren't one-time contracts.
 
Hakobyan is making extremely dangerous statements by revealing the armed forces' structure and peculiarities of military units. This is top secret information, the revelation of which is a felony per Code 23.
 
Hakobyan criticized the decision to purchase Su-30 jets, calling it an ineffective decision. When making such claims, one should always keep in mind that the Defense Ministry of Armenia makes purchases not only for Artsakh security but also the security of the Republic of Armenia, against possible enemies who possess many modern fighter jets. Hakobyan had the opportunity to ask MoD whether the jets were used during this war, but he didn't. 
 
Hakobyan lied about Su-30sm jets not being equipped with missiles. The process was carried out before the war and concluded during the war. *[the jets were purchased very recently and the army earlier said they needed some time to train pilots and bring them to fighting state]*
 
Hakobyan claims that OSA air defense units purchased by Armenia weren't used and they were ineffective, and that had we purchased TOR units instead, we could resist the Turkish drones better. 

This claim is also further from the truth. First, we had TOR and OSA units but they were both destroyed by enemy drones, regardless of how modern they were. The problem is, the Bayraktar drones used against us were manufactured in recent months so the tools against these drones were still in the process of making.
 
Hakobyan incorrectly claims OSA air defense units weren't used. In reality, OSAs shot 62 enemy drones [Israeli-made ones, presumably]. Hakobyan should have remembered that it was this OSA weapon that shot Israeli-made Hermes-900 in July. Hakobyan focuses exclusively on OSAs yet we have other air defense tools, too, that are being continuously resupplied.
 
Hakobyan lied about the army mobilization process stopping on the 3rd day of the war. This is a complete lie and doesn't bring honor to a military man. Thousands of citizens can confirm that they were drafted later, appeared in local military offices, underwent training, and went to the front lines.
 
Moreover, in parallel with the proper replenishment of the troops, completely new military units were formed consisted of reservists. This was also recorded and presented by the media.
 
It's unacceptable for Hakobyan to claim that ""100% of what MoD said during the war were false"". Being a high ranking military official during the war, he never complained during the war. The MoD gave information in a way not to harm the ongoing military actions.
 
Hakobyan tries to deny catching COVID during the war, yet there are documents proving that he did. *[it was reported that Hakobyan had an issue with the first lady so he left Artsakh. Artsakh official later claimed he left Artsakh due to COVID.]*
 
Lastly, during his press conference, Hakobyan made statements about our international military cooperation agreements that are completely unacceptable and false, and there are documents that prove his claims are false. Hakobyan's motives to deny obvious facts are unclear.
 
The fact that Hakobyan no longer works in the system doesn't mean he should create new problems for the MoD that's already busy working 24/7.
 
MoD acknowledges that there were issues during the war, and is analyzing them in detail. Former GCS Movses Hakobyan bears some of the responsibility for these issues. //
 
&nbsp;
 
The SIS is investigating the claims made by Hakobyan. He was questioned for 40 minutes.
 
LHK party suggests the creation of a fact-finding Parliamentary group, led by the ruling party, to examine how the war was handled.

##November 19 timeline
 
**COVID stats:** +3,796 tested. +1,520 infected. +8,319 healed. +31 deaths. 31,243 active. 475,956 tested.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1035327.html
 
**9:00 Healthcare Minister Torosyan about COVID and soldiers:** the healthcare system remains overloaded due to COVID. However, we've been able to provide sufficient care to almost everyone. The death rate has been 1.5%; it's significantly lower than in some countries with 4-10%.
 
Many international doctors visited Armenia for COVID and soldier treatment. Some are still here. We agreed with the WHO to send a new COVID team. 

There are talks about the 3rd virus wave. Our doctors have been struggling for 8 months.

Some residents believe rumors and rush to purchase unnecessary antibiotics and ""COVID medicine"". This could lead to a shortage for those who actually need it. Fortunately, we have no issues with importing or locally producing more supplies.
 
36 medical centers have been able to provide aid to 100% of the wounded soldiers. Ambulance vehicles and helicopters worked around the clock during the war to transport the wounded to Armenia. 15% are in serious/critical condition. Around 1% of wounded soldiers died in hospitals. All hospitals are controlled by the govt under the military emergency law.
 
We're entering the rehabilitation phase. A new center with 250 beds will be built. Other centers will maximize their utilization. It'll be funded by the govt and diasporan aid. The govt will dedicate $5.2m every year for continuous care.  
 
We're currently building a new prosthesis center for soldiers who lost limbs. We'll build prosthesis in Armenia and make it available quickly.
 
We received large quantities of medical aid during the war, thank you. Nowadays the best help would be for diasporan experts to visit Armenia and help with their experience.
 
The increase in the Healthcare budget for 2021 will be small due to COVID economics, but it's still larger than a few years ago.

**12:19:** All Armenia Fund will hold the annual charity telethon in the US on November 26th. A phone-thon will be held in Europe on Nov 19-22.
 
Himnadram director Haykak Arshamyan dismissed rumors by former regime allied about wasting charity funds on salary bonuses. ""It's simple manipulation. The Fund money isn't used on salaries or bonuses. There is a contract that clearly defines how the money should be spent. Finance Ministry will soon publish the report and we'll place it on our website.""
 
""We cannot purchase weapons. Our funds are spent on healthcare, social welfare, so the govt can save money on those programs and [use its resources to buy weapons instead].""
 
Himnadram is cooperating with Artsakh and its regional branches to identify the top priorities. The first package is for Artsakh residents who need humanitarian aid, and the restoration of Artsakh infrastructure. The second package is for soldiers who need medical aid, therapy, mental health support.

Global freedom faces a dire threat. Around the world, the enemies of liberal democracy—a form of self-government in which human rights are recognized and every individual is entitled to equal treatment under law—are accelerating their attacks. Authoritarian regimes have become more effective at co-opting or circumventing the norms and institutions meant to support basic liberties, and at providing aid to others who wish to do the same. In countries with long-established democracies, internal forces have exploited the shortcomings in their systems, distorting national politics to promote hatred, violence, and unbridled power. Those countries that have struggled in the space between democracy and authoritarianism, meanwhile, are increasingly tilting toward the latter. The global order is nearing a tipping point, and if democracy’s defenders do not work together to help guarantee freedom for all people, the authoritarian model will prevail.

Freedom scores (higher=better):

Armenia: 54/100

Nagorno-Karabakh: 37/100

Turkey: 32/100

Russia: 12/100

Azerbaijan: 9/100

##November 18 timeline

Nevada's Clarke County (Las Vegas) has officially recognized the Artsakh Republic.

https://twitter.com/ANCA_WR/status/1328753472565493761


**9:37:** 1700 Artsakh refugees have returned home so far. The population was around 145,000 before the war. Some 10-20% never left. 

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1035190.html

**10:09 PM Pashinyan presented the roadmap:** It is time to talk about methods to overcome the current situation. I have already stated that I consider myself the number-one responsible for the situation. I am also responsible for overcoming the situation and establishing stability and security in the country.  

1) Negotiations must resume in OSCE format, with the emphasis on Artsakh status and the return of Artsakh residents to their homeland. 

2) Secure Artsakh residents' rights to return home. Fully restore daily life. Repair infrastructure. 

3) Social aid for families of fallen soldiers. 

4) Repairing infrastructure damaged in the Republic of Armenia. 

5) Aid for wounded soldiers, obtaining prosthetics, educational training courses for changing professions if necessary. 

6) Returning POWs and aid for their families. Clarification of the status of those who are missing, and aid for their families. 

7) Rehabilitation system for those who participated in the war, and for the general public, too.

8) The beginning of reforms in the army. 

9) Defeating COVID and overcoming its consequences. 

10) Restoration of the environment for economic activity.

11) Activation of demographic programs.

12) Reforming electoral laws [opposition and the govt had agreed to lower the passing threshold to allow more opposition parties to enter Parliament, etc.]

13) Introduction of the Institute of Specialized Judges as the first step in establishing an anti-corruption courts. Launching the process to confiscate illegally embezzled property.

14) Conducting regular consultations with representatives of the Armenian political and civil community.

15) Consultations with diasporan institutes and individuals. 

The goal is to ensure the democratic stability of Armenia and to create guarantees that nothing threatens the formation of power in Armenia through the free will of the people. For this, I'll make changes to the government team. 

We will need 6 months to launch the aforementioned tasks. In June 2021, I will report to you the progress, and based on the public response, we will decide on what to do next.

**11:11:** US Senator Bob Menendez called on the US government to impose sanctions on Turkey and Azerbaijan for the military aggression, and to end weapon supplies to them. 

He called for a $100 million aid to Artsakh refugees.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1035203.html


**11:42 COVID stats:** +4,109 tested. +1,589 infected (down). +1,726 healed. +28 deaths.  38,082 active (down). 

**HealthMin Torosyan:** the percentage of positive tests and the absolute numbers are declining, but the healthcare system is still under stress. 

We still have 375 patients waiting for beds, 25 of whom are in serious condition. We will likely hospitalize them sometime today. A few days ago the waiting list was 800. The trend can change again with the resumption of schools. 

Our main issue right now is oxygen supplies. Without it, the medication is ineffective. We'll soon receive more oxygen stations, followed by four large stations in December. We had purchased many oxygen stations during the first wave but today's large numbers, partly a result of the war, were outside of our predications. 

We're negotiating over vaccines. There are agreements. They will likely arrive in mid-Spring.

We have no shortage of COVID test kits. New test labs are opening; two in the past week alone.

Diesel generators, emergency vehicles, medical products, basic consumer products, heating devices, portable gas stoves, mobile fuel stations, beds, etc. were purchased during the war. Simultaneously, 100 tons of aid was coordinated.

Himnadram will help Armenia's budget to pay for social welfare, healthcare, infrastructure repair, etc. The documents are ready. Tens of thousands of Artsakh refugees were aided.

International independent auditors will examine the finances.

&nbsp;

During a Parliamentary session, the Deputy PM Mher Grigoryan confirmed that Himnadram has transferred some of the funds for humanitarian work. 

In response, former regime's HHK MP Armen Ashotyan, without evidence, claimed the money is being stolen. 

[**Context**: The former regime is mad because they were caught stealing Himnadram's donations in 2018. After the 2018 revolution, the Pashinyan administration busted HHK's Himnadram director with stealing the funds and using them on gambling. The director confessed and returned part of the stolen money. Himnadram then underwent a complete change in administration which raised the trust towards the fund. Now the former regime is sabotaging the diaspora's donation efforts for political gain.]

At atmosphere of agreement is not always achieved by forming [aforementioned type of govt consisted of various parties]. There is a need for agreement around two points: security and stability, and to guarantee democracy.

The examination revealed that Petrosyan was among the rioters who broke into the govt building and caused destruction on November 10th. A felony case was launched against him and he was arrested shortly afterward.

On November 13th he was charged with multiple felony counts. The same day, at 8 pm, his 3-day detention period had expired so he was released from the police station. The same day, prosecutors asked the court to arrest him for 2 months before his trial.

Investigation revealed a witness who was walking nearby and saw how a man grabbed a flag pole and climbed at the center of the bridge at around 10 pm.

9/28/2023,Ex-prez. of Nagorno-Karabakh was blocked from attending Western negotiations: interview // Armenia to officially downgrade ties w/CSTO: source // France to assign mil. attache // Hayk Marutyan joins pro-Russian ex-regime & Dog // Vardanyan arrested // Exodus continues,"


##interview with ex-PM Aram Sargsyan || Nagorno-Karabakh ex-president Arayik had purchased tickets to attend Western-back negotiations; pro-Russia forces organized a coup

**Context:** Nagorno-Karabakh's opposition leader Samvel Babayan has so far revealed that, with the permission of President Arayik Harutyunyan, he was holding negotiations with Azerbaijan, and that Azerbaijan had agreed for Nagorno-Karabakh to have autonomy and its own national guard. According to Babayan, the pro-Russian former regime did not support this because they believed Russia could help them freeze the conflict so they could try to eventually gain *full* independence. To that end, the former regime removed Arayik from power, appointed their strongly pro-Russian man as president, and rejected Babayan's negotiations efforts that would have secured ""merely"" autonomy and guards. Babayan believes the former regime derailed the efforts under the orders of Russia. Babayan and Azerbaijan did not want to use Russia as a mediator.

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** Despite the ongoing forced exodus and the ethnic cleansing, this is not the end of Nagorno-Karabakh. Kosovo's Albanians had also left the region. There were 1.5 million of them. They eventually returned home. In 1999 the UN established 4 pillars (legal, security, democracy, economy) and established influence over the region.

Why didn't this happen in Nagorno-Karabakh? Because we had Russian peacekeepers instead of international, and no steps were taken to reach out to the UN's genocide prevention office despite my letters to Ruben Vardanyan and Arayik Harutyunyan [Nagorno-Karabakh leaders].

Arayik Harutyunyan had purchased tickets and was preparing to attend the Sophia negotiations hosted by the West. This was supported by Pashinyan who had ""lowered the bar"" and had been urging Nagorno-Karabakh representatives to accept being one level below an ""equal party"".

After the replacement of Arayik Harutyunyan [by pro-Russian forces], U.S. mediator Bono no longer organized a new meeting because they believed the new regime was only going to follow the Kremlin's orders. Russia did everything possible to derail the Western efforts, leading us to the war. They perhaps calculated that Armenia would get involved so Azerbaijan could forcefully take the ""Zangezur corridor"", to be controlled by Russia.

**REPORTER:** Why did the regime in Nagorno-Karabakh prefer depopulation over the Western platform?

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** Russia gave them reassurances that Nagorno-Karabakh would remain Armenian. This is why they held a maximalist stance until the end. I used to be friends with Arkadiy Ghukasyan and have spent many hours with Bako Sahakyan [the pro-Russian regime in Nagorno-Karabakh]. None of them obviously wanted this outcome. They were simply convinced that Russia wouldn't betray them so they appointed their ARF colleague.

**REPORTER:** Why did the regime trust Russia if Russia couldn't even open the Lachin corridor for 10 months or defend villages?

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** Those should have been enough to distrust Russia, but they joined Russia to criticize Armenia for everything. Every excuse was made to justify Russia's inaction. Who are the street protesters blaming today? Armenia, of course. 

**REPORTER:** Why didn't Armenia intervene in Nagorno-Karabakh?

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** Synchronous work was necessary between the governments in Yerevan and Stepanakert. If the Nagorno-Karabakh government adopted a maximalist stance, did they first ensure that Armenia would intervene to help in the event their plan backfired? Was Armenia supposed to lose Syunik, too?

**REPORTER:** Will AM-AZ sign an agreement during the upcoming meeting hosted by the West?

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** They could sign an agreement recognizing borders under the 1991 agreement. This would address 70% of the issues. This would allow Armenia to develop its economy. The U.S. envoy brought an economic package with them. They are negotiating with the government to build semiconductors, memory chips, and capsular nuclear plants in Armenia. There is also a military element in the package. //

##around half of the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh have been forced to flee to Armenia due to unlivable conditions created by Azerbaijan

54,000 refugees entered Armenia as of Wednesday afternoon. Around half of them have been registered while the other half chose not to because they went straight to their families already residing in Armenia. 

The registered refugees will be given food stamps and eventually housing in nearby settlements in Gegharkunik, Vayots Dzor, and Syunik.

The government urges the unregistered refugees to also contact authorities so they can receive other forms of assistance.

##Azerbaijan has agreed to an international observer mission in Nagorno-Karabakh, we expect them to abide by that: says U.S. State Department while Azerbaijan insists there is ""no need"" to send observers 

**STATE DEPT:** Aliyev has said there will be no further military action and that he would accept an international observer mission. We expect him to abide by that. Blinken spoke with Aliyev and underscored the urgency of no further hostilities and that there be unconditional protection and freedom of movement for civilians and unhindered humanitarian access.

**REPORTER:** Can you describe what the monitoring mission will look like? Have you been able to test the waters with both Yerevan and Baku?

**STATE DEPT:** The exact mechanism is something that remains in discussion with our partners so I don’t want to preview what it might look like before we finish those conversations.

**AZERBAIJAN:** We will allow the entry of an Azerbaijan-based UN Coordinator, but there is no need for a broader monitoring mission.

**GERMANY:** Nobody truly understands what's happening in Nagorno-Karabakh. Thousands of residents are afraid for their lives. They see the road to Armenia as the only solution. The numbers are growing.

We are working with our partners to send an international mission to Nagorno-Karabakh. If Azerbaijan allows it, it will show they are serious about ensuring the safety and well-being of the population. In Nagorno-Karabakh, there is currently a lack of almost everything necessary for a dignified life: food, medicine, and hygiene items. //

U.S. Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri Kim and USAID chief Samantha Power have arrived in Azerbaijan to discuss a ""stable and dignified peace"" between Armenians and Azeris.

...

>“Many in Brussels and Washington feel shocked and betrayed by Azerbaijan’s use of force,” said Thomas de Waal. 

>western officials believe the inaction of the 2,000 Russian peacekeepers suggests that a side deal was reached between Moscow and Baku, who both blamed the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, and his pro-western pivot for the fighting.

##Armenia takes first official step to downgrade ties to Russia-led CSTO military bloc: source

According to Factor.am sources, Armenia will not appoint a new ambassador to CSTO. The ambassador was recalled last month. At the time many believed it was part of the ongoing diplomatic reshuffling process. 

Despite the contractual obligations, CSTO refused to provide military assistance to Armenia when Azerbaijan invaded Armenia proper in 2021 and 2022. Yerevan also accused CSTO of refusing to acknowledge that Armenia proper was invaded. 

Pashinyan has since refused to host CSTO exercises in Armenia, and refused to invite CSTO's border observers to Armenia: *""If you don't even acknowledge where the border is, what are you going to monitor?""*

In contrast, the EU has openly acknowledged and condemned the invasion of Armenia proper. Pashinyan subsequently invited EU observers to monitor the borders. Their mission was extended.

##Azerbaijan kidnaps Nagorno-Karabakh's ex-PM Ruben Vardanyan at a checkpoint; Margarita Simonyan falls into depression

Vardanyan was [attempting to enter](https://youtu.be/1sGN0PPMbeY?t=67) Armenia by crossing the checkpoint illegally installed by Azerbaijan on the Lachin corridor several months ago. He was taken to Baku.

Armenia has contacted the European Court of Human Rights to request information from Azerbaijan and ""to protect Vardanyan's rights"".

**RUSSIA:** We can't bail him out because he is no longer a Russian citizen. //

**MARGARITA SIMONYAN:** It is terrifying to imagine what fate awaits Vardanyan in Azerbaijan. And Vardanyan, a world-class billionaire, an employer of George Clooney and others, did it all voluntarily. He left his comfortable life and Russian citizenship behind to help Karabakh. [After the war] everyone called and begged Vardanyan to return. They offered him assistance to return. But he preferred to remain where his people were. //

##ex-mayor Hayk Marutyan has agreed to join the pro-Russian former regime and a party of fugitives to become Yerevan mayor and later remove Pashinyan from power

Marutyan will need 33 Council votes to become Yerevan mayor. For that, he needs the support of the former regime (Tevanyan) and a party of fugitives (Dog).

The pro-Russian former regime wants Marutyan to help them remove Pashinyan. Marutyan has agreed that Pashinyan's removal will be their next step. Not through the streets, but through elections.

The party of fugitives wants its members to be assigned to supervisory roles. Marutyan promises to assign them as long as they pass through the necessary competition process. He also promises to create a new monitoring commission and appoint Dog's people to lead it.

The council will hold a vote to elect a mayor in a few days.

##IMF suspends $280M assistance programme to Georgia after its refusal to impose U.S. sanctions on former chief prosecutor

Georgia's central bank wants to ""shield"" the ex-Prosecutor General Otar Partskhaladze from sanctions imposed by the U.S. State Department.

>Partskhaladze [a dual RU-GE citizen], who is accused of involvement in Russia’s economy and facilitating Russian influence in Georgia, is known to have ties to Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia’s former prime minister

The central bank administration argues that a court order is necessary before it can impose the sanctions. Some bank officials resigned in protest.

On September 28, Davit Babayan wrote that Azerbaijan was demanding his surrender, otherwise, there would be consequences for other individuals and Nagorno-Karabakh. He agreed to surrender. 

We also know that President Shahramanyan, after signing the decree to dissolve Nagorno-Karabakh, departed from Stepanakert to [Azeri-controlled] Shushi to meet Ali Nakhiyev, the head of Azerbaijani state security agency. In that meeting, they discussed the safe transfer of Nagorno-Karabakh's former leaders to Armenia [they weren't arrested at the time].

In order to agree to discuss it, Azerbaijan first demanded the handover of Davit Babayan. This is what Davit Babayan was referring to when he said his refusal would lead to consequences for many people. He was referring to other leaders.

President Shahramanyan's office vehicle drove Davit Babayan to Shushi, handed him over, and returned to Stepanakert. 

Shahramanyan and dozens of other Nagorno-Karabakh officials have been able to enter Armenia.

##Vladimir Putin about the arrest of Ruben Vardanyan and other Nagorno-Karabakh leaders by Azerbaijan 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan has arrested several members of the Nagorno-Karabakh administration, including Ruben Vardanyan, who is well-known here in Russia. Can we...

**PUTIN:** Vardanyan had renounced his Russian citizenship.

**REPORTER:** Can we urge the Azerbaijani government to show clemency?

**PUTIN:** We always have, and continue to do so. I spoke with Aliyev. We have also spoken in the past about Nagorno-Karabakh. Aliyev has always reassured me that he would ensure the rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians there. But there are no more Armenians left there. They all left. You know that everyone has left. There are no Armenians left there. Maybe a thousand. That's it. There is no one left there.  

As for the arrest of ex-leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh, I won't go into details but as far as I can tell, they aren't even welcome in Yerevan. I hope the Azerbaijani government will, after all, make a humanitarian gesture now that the territorial issues have been resolved. //

##Vladimir Putin about the Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations and the 2020 war

**PUTIN:** After the fall of the USSR, ethnic clashes began between Armenians and Azeris. It started in Azerbaijan's Sumgayit and spread to Nagorno-Karabakh. 

Armenia, and not Nagorno-Karabakh, ended up controlling 20% of Azerbaijan's territories: Nagorno-Karabakh and the 7 surrounding regions. It continued for several decades. 

Over the past 15 years, we offered Armenians to make a compromise by returning 5 of the surrounding regions to Azerbaijan. This would maintain a land connection between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. 

But our friends from Nagorno-Karabakh repeatedly rejected the proposal, saying it would make them too vulnerable. We explained to them that Azerbaijan was growing stronger with the help of oil and gas, and that they should go for a compromise solution while there is still a chance. 

We even offered them to pass a UN Security Council resolution and ensure the safety of the Lachin corridor and the Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh. But they rejected the offer. They said they preferred to ""fight"", which led to the 2020 war. *[Armenians agreed to return the 5 regions but Azerbaijan rejected the idea and every time demanded more and more. Putin does not mention this.]*

During the 2020 war, I offered Armenia a ceasefire that would have stopped the Azerbaijani army. We already had an agreement with Azerbaijan, but Armenia rejected it. *[Pashinyan later revealed that Russia wanted to establish a corridor through Armenia's Syunik province and place it under the control of Russian peacekeepers, not to be confused with Russian border agents. Pashinyan said he was firmly against the ceasefire-for-corridor offer. This was around October 19.]*

Armenia said they'd rather continue to fight. In the end, we reached an agreement with Azerbaijan that they would stop after capturing Shushi. //

##Putin about Pashinyan 

**MARGARITA SIMONYAN:** Every normal Armenian understands that Pashinyan was brought to power to surrender Nagorno-Karabakh.

**PUTIN:** I disagree. He had no intentions of surrendering Nagorno-Karabakh. He even announced that Karabakh was part of Armenia. He was the first-ever Armenian leader to do so. Of course his position changed later. In my view he sincerely wanted to maintain the situation under control, there was no attempt to intentionally surrender anything.

##U.S. State Department about the ""secret"" meeting in Istanbul and the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh

**QUESTION:** Tell us about the secret meeting in Istanbul *[Context: US-EU-RU met to discuss the lifting of the blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh]*.

**STATE DEPT:** It wasn't really a ""secret"" meeting. We engage with stakeholders and interlocutors in the region quite regularly. We met in Istanbul to discuss urgent humanitarian issues around Nagorno-Karabakh.

**QUESTION:** Was it a meeting of Minsk Group co-chairs? 

**STATE DEPT:** It was – it took place at the working level.

**QUESTION:** Who initiated that? 

**STATE DEPT:** Can't go into specifics.

**QUESTION:** This is the first high-level meeting between U.S. and Russian officials since the war in Ukraine.

**STATE DEPT:** Again, it was a meeting that took place at the working level with a specific topic on the issue of humanitarian needs in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. That was the scope and the context of this meeting. Do not overinterpret this to mean anything else.

**QUESTION:** I wonder how frustrated are you that two days after that meeting, the dominos started falling? *[Azerbaijan attacked Nagorno-Karabakh]*

**STATE DEPT:** We’re concerned by the situation after the recent hostilities, and it has resulted in over 100,000 ethnic Armenians fleeing the Nagorno-Karabakh region into Armenia, and we’re closely monitoring the situation on the ground.

##European Parliament condemns Azerbaijan's violent seizure of Nagorno-Karabakh and calls for sanctions against Aliyev regime

The European Parliament adopted a resolution (Yes - 491, No - 9) strongly condemning the September 19 invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh. The MEPs called it a ""gross violation of international law and human rights"".

MEPs said the situation amounts to ethnic cleansing after 101,000 people were ""forced to flee"" their homeland. 

Parliament calls on the EU to adopt targeted sanctions against the government officials in Azerbaijan.

Parliament also calls on the EU to reduce its dependency on Azeri gas imports and to stop it completely in the event of another attack.

Parliament also condemns Hungary for blocking an earlier statement by EU Member States.

##Azerbaijan says its refusal to take part in the Granada meeting doesn't mean they are rejecting the Brussels platform as a whole

Azerbaijan said it will join the future AM-EU-AZ meetings.

Today's meeting in Granada took place without Azerbaijan. AM-EU-FR-GR discussed the events in the South Caucasus. The participants released a statement in support of Armenia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

There was also a meeting between Zelensky and Pashinyan. Zelenskty wrote, ""During our first-ever meeting, Armenian Prime Minister  Nikol Pashinyan and I focused on the security situation in the South Caucasus. Ukraine is interested in the region’s stability and friendly relations with its nations. We also discussed our bilateral cooperation and interregional economic projects.""

##Azerbaijan to Armenia: you misunderstood, we don't want THAT type of ""corridor""

**ELCHIN AMIRBEKOV (Aliyev office):** Armenians likely misunderstood us. We have no claim on these territories [of trade route]. We recognize it as the sovereign territory of Armenia. 

Another question is how the Armenians will ensure the security of this corridor. According to the Nov. 9 Statement, Russian border agents were supposed to ensure the safety of [Azeri] traffic [passing through Armenia]. However, it appears Armenians are reviewing that commitment because they no longer wish to grant that role to Russian border agents. //

##... ""corridor"" context

During the 2020 war, there was an attempt to convince Armenia to surrender the control of a narrow strip of land in southern Armenia to Russian peacekeepers, according to PM Pashinyan. It would be used as a corridor by Azerbaijan and Turkey, controlled by Russia. Armenia rejected the idea.

Under the 2020 ceasefire agreement, Armenia agreed to allow Russian border agents (who are already present in many parts of Armenia) to monitor the trade flow and safety. The plan was to install customs checkpoints and have them work jointly with Armenian agents.

However, Azerbaijan demanded only Russian border agents to be present on the trade route. Armenia said that would be the same as losing control over the land, and called it an attack on its sovereignty. Armenia said its agents must be present and have control over the trade route. Azerbaijan launched a military aggression and invaded parts of Armenia. Armenia did not change its position. 

To meet the terms under the Nov. 9 ceasefire agreement, Armenia agrees (according to NatSec Armen Grigoryan) for Russian border agents to use cameras and other modern tech to jointly monitor the trade route alongside their Armenian counterparts who would be on the ground. On the other side, Azerbaijan has broken almost every commitment under the Nov. 9 agreement.

##European Court of Human Rights rules in favor of Armenia in lawsuits brought by Azerbaijanis

⚖️ Gurbanov v. Armenia: The plaintiff's relative was a soldier who infiltrated into Armenian positions and killed 3 unsuspecting unarmed soldiers before being shot. Armenia returned his body to Azerbaijan. Armenia did not violate any laws in the process, did not unreasonably delay the return of the body, and there was no discrimination.

⚖️ Guliyev and Asgarov v. Armenia: The plaintiffs' relatives were Azeri saboteurs who infiltrated and murdered an Armenian teenager (civilian). They were caught by the Armenian army. Armenia did not deprive them of the ability to contact their families, said the Court. They were treated like other prisoners.

⚖️ Ghazaryan v. Azerbaijan: Azerbaijan arrested the plaintiff in 2018 and released in 2020. The Court has found that he was illegally tortured in Azerbaijan. His rights to liberty and personal integrity were also violated.

⚖️ Aliyev v. Armenia, Allahverdiyev v. Armenia, Hakobyan v. Azerbaijan, Ohanyan v. Azerbaijan: The plaintiffs claimed the defendant countries violated their property rights during the 2016 April war. The Court said it lacks jurisdiction over the alleged violations.

Earlier we learned that dozens of Armenian trucks were stuck in the checkpoint.

The trucks were allowed to proceed today after Russian agents took samples for inspection. Trucks moving other types of goods have not reported entry problems.

Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan  did not stop the brutal war since he was waiting for assistance from the Western partners. Armenian military-political leadership expected that Washington would be guided by Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, passed in October 1992. As the Democratic presidential nominee, Biden was critical of Azerbaijan’s role in the outbreak of fighting with Armenia, saying Baku instigated the fighting while calling on then-President Trump to block military assistance to Azerbaijan, specifically to withdraw the waiver under section 907. While Yerevan was under the delusion, the war claimed the lives of 150-200 Armenians daily.

As in 2020, American and British troops did not come to the Armenian mountains, so in 2022 they will not be in the Ukrainian Black Earth region. Zelensky's illusions are dispelled day by day.

The wars of 2020 and 2022 have a lot in common, but they have a number of differences. Thus, the ""Western civilized community"" ignores the war crimes of Azerbaijan, including the facts of the use of phosphorus weapons.

At the same time, the deputies of the European Parliament give a standing ovation to Volodymyr Zelensky. European officials applaud not because of support for Ukraine, but because they welcome the president of the country, who is ready to turn his own people into cannon fodder in the confrontation with Russia. Yes, the West is ready to fight to the last. Until the last Ukrainian.

Meanwhile, while the Aliyev government continues to take an offensive stance, Joe Biden signed a $45 million aid package for Armenia, while not supporting Karabakh and the thousands of civilians who became refugees as a result of Baku's ethnic cleansing. This is clearly the wrong signal for Baku, which has received more than $164 million from the United States over the past decade.

##U.S. wants to send a long-term international monitoring group to Nagorno-Karabakh to find out if conditions allow for civilians to live there safely 

**STATE DEPT:** Hundreds of thousands have departed. We don't know what percentage of them may want to come back, if the conditions allowed, if they felt sufficient assurances about their treatment if they would return, which is why we are reiterating our call for an independent international monitoring mission that would provide transparency and reassurance to the population of Nagorno-Karabakh that the rights and securities of ethnic Armenians would be protected. We continue to work with our allies and partners about what a more long-term mission ought to look like. We think there ought to be an international monitoring mission there to observe and guarantee them.

**QUESTION:** Was this an ethnic cleansing?

**STATE DEPT:** It’s not something I can speak to with any degree of finality from this podium. We take allegations of ethnic cleansing, genocide, or other atrocities seriously.

##Russia has betrayed Armenian people by standing aside in Nagorno-Karabakh: EU's Charles Michel criticizes Russia and Azerbaijan

**MICHEL:** It is clear that Russia has betrayed the Armenian people. Russia wanted to have soldiers on the ground to guarantee this peace and security agreement. But we see that the [Azerbaijani] military operation was launched without the slightest reaction from the Russian peacekeepers. The European Union, on the other hand, had no military presence on the ground. //

EuroNews writes:

>Baku recently regained control of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenian separatists after launching a military offensive. An estimated 100,000 ethnic Armenians have since fled in fear of persecution as Azerbaijani forces tighten their grip on the region. 

>Experts say Baku's actions amount to a war crime, and Armenia has accused [Azerbaijan] of pursuing ethnic cleansing. 

>Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has also condemned Russia for ignoring signs of Baku’s escalation and failing to protect Armenians

**CHARLES MICHEL:** I am extremely disappointed by the decision that was taken by Azerbaijan and I have expressed that very firmly to President Aliyev. It’s now up to Azerbaijan to show goodwill by engaging while respecting international law to protect the rights and security of the entire population that lives in Azerbaijan, including the Armenian population.

We are very committed to supporting Armenia, which is receiving a high number of refugees who have left their home region in Nagorno-Karabakh.

We also need to remain engaged at a political and diplomatic level to make sure that there’s a very clear reaffirmation of the respect for the territorial integrity of Armenia. //

##Lawsuit Says New Hampshire Governor's Family May Profit Off Humanitarian Crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh: The Daily Beast

>A Sununu-linked mining company prepares to exploit resources in a disputed region as ethnic Armenians flee, according to legal docs and other public records.

...

>John Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor and ex-White House chief-of-staff—held stakes and positions in a U.K.-based firm that secured mining rights within the province from Baku, rights only an Azerbaijani reconquest could guarantee. Public records, news reports, and corporate filings support many of the suit’s factual assertions.

...

>[Sununu's] office also would not pledge that the governor would forfeit any potential returns from the company’s prospective business in Nagorno-Karabakh, so as not to profit from Azerbaijan’s alleged ethnic cleansing

...

>The lawsuit highlights several subsequent events: on March 31 [of 2016] Azeri President Ilham Aliyev met with John Sununu [in Washington D.C.], and the next day, Azeri forces attacked Nagorno-Karabakh, an advance the lawsuit suggests aimed at Demirli [town where NK Armenians operated a processing plant]. After four days of fighting, Aliyev’s forces withdrew.

>But Azerbaijan grabbed back some of the territory four and half years later [during the 2020 war], prompting Anglo Asian [Sununu-linked mining company] to applaud in a statement to stockholders what it described as the “liberation” of one of its mining concession zones

>Almost exactly one year after the 2020 conflict began, Anglo Asian obtained initial Azerbaijani approvals to exploit two sites within the still-autonomous portions of Nagorno-Karabakh, including the Demirli installation.

>In December 2022, Azerbaijan demanded access to one of the mines as a condition for restoring Nagorno-Karabakh’s food, medicine, and fuel route from Armenia. The move came precisely one week after Anglo Asian penned missives to the U.S., U.K, United Nations, and the European Union complaining of “illegal mining” at its concession locations in the disputed region

>as of June of this year, Anglo Asian reported it was unable to access these locations, and the blockade of the corridor has persisted despite international condemnation and allegations of genocide.

>However, on Sept. 26, Anglo Asian had good news for its shareholders. [Azerbaijan launched a military aggression and invaded Nagorno-Karabakh along with the mining territory.]

##Armenian parliament ratifies the Rome Statute || How it unfolded  || What was the opposition saying shortly after the coup in Nagorno-Karabakh? || International response

A heated conversation ensued between the ruling and pro-Russian opposition MPs. The opposition accused the Pashinyan administration of surrendering Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan and of launching an ""unconstitutional"" process to ratify the Rome Statute [against Russia's wishes]. A ruling party MP, in turn, accused the opposition of being Russia's agents:

**Ruling MP:** Do you think we have forgotten your euphoria when you carried out a coup and hijacked power in Nagorno-Karabakh, and how you announced that thanks to the coup, Nagorno-Karabakh and Russia were strong allies now? Where is your ""ally"" now? 

Wasn't that you who announced that ""patriots have finally taken control of Nagorno-Karabakh""? Which patriots? The ones that signed the dissolution of Nagorno-Karabakh? The history repeats. Every capitulation in our modern history was signed by the ARF. The Nov. 9 statement was far from being a capitulation. But you went and signed the real one. 

**Oppo MP (from her seat):** Who are YOU? You are the enemy of Armenia!

**Ruling MP:** Still not an agent of a foreign state, tho...

*[oppositoon benches explode in boos and chants, Speaker intervenes to establish order but the shouting continues]*

**Ruling MP:** For 3 years you've knocked on every possible door, looking for help to hijack power in Armenia. You couldn't do it here, but you succeeded in Nagorno-Karabakh accompanied by loud cheers and congratulations. We saw the outcome a week later.

**Oppo MP:** You abandoned Nagorno-Karabakh and didn't provide support during the September 19 attack.

**Ruling MP:** I'm going to play an episode from [Robert Kocharyan's] TV5 media outlet's coverage of the coup in Nagorno-Karabakh. [VIDEO: TV5 anchor berates the ousted Nagorno-Karabakh president Arayik and says the new regime won't follow Pashinyan's plan; opposition cheers the coup and believes that Nagorno-Karabakh has finally rediscovered its true identity by becoming a factor whose opinion will need to be taken into account; a ranking opposition MP says Pashinyan was lying about Nagorno-Karabakh not having true allies on the international arena and that Russia is the true ally of Nagorno-Karabakh; opposition MP notes that only Russia has not condemned the coup in Nagorno-Karabakh; opposition announes that ""patriots"" have taken over Nagorno-Karabakh and that now it's time to do the same in Armenia. The ruling MP stops the video.] //

#... approved

The government presented the Rome Statute for ratification. The opposition voted against (22), the ruling party voted in favor (60). 

The opposition party ARF is concerned that the Statute could prevent Armenia from forcefully liberating Nagorno-Karabakh in the future because it would target specific Armenian military commanders and generals if there was an attempt.  

##... foreign reaction

**KOSACHEV, Russian Senator:** Unfortunately, Armenia, after all, has taken this clearly unfriendly step towards Russia. There were no forces in the Armenian parliament that would have been able to stop the process of legal enslavement of this country by the Hague. // *[Russia believes the ratification is a step against Vladimir Putin, who has a warrant for his arrest for kidnapping and ""re-educating"" Ukrainian children. Armenia said it will use loopholes in order not to arrest Putin, but that hasn't been enough for Kremlin mouthpieces who have adopted a hostile stance towards Armenia in order to appease Russia's allies Turkey and Azerbaijan.]*

**VOROBYOV, Russian deputy speaker:** The decision of the Armenian parliamentarians destroys the constructive and reliable relations that were formed within the framework of the Russian-Armenian inter-parliamentary commission. But I am confident that no force will be able to destroy the age-old friendship of the Russian and Armenian peoples. //

**FRANCE:** We welcome Armenia's decision to ratify the Rome Statute and become a state party to the International Criminal Court. Fighting impunity for crimes is a condition for peace and stability.

##Russian customs agents are throttling the import of Armenian cognac 

The troubles began in March-April after Russian customs agents allegedly discovered fake bottles. Only products from specific companies were being pulled over for inspection at the time.

Armenia's representative at the Upper Lars border checkpoint does not believe politics is in play. He does not rule out actual issues with counterfeit products.

##an unknown army general has expressed willingness to join the pro-Russian opposition that wants to remove Pashinyan with force: opposition MP

Opposition leader Vazgen Manukyan [had earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16wfz9g/nagornokarabakh_depopulation_war_crimes/) urged the army to organize a coup against Pashinyan. A few days later, his fellow opposition MP Ruben Hakobyan gave an interview:

**REPORTER:** You [opposition forces] told the population that Pashinyan surrendered Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan. Thousands of people listened to you and gathered in the Republic Square. But within just two days, people began to whistle your speeches. It's all on video. People were chanting *""enough with your speeches, just tell us what to do""*. Your rallies died down 2-3 days later. Don't you think your [low rating and weakness] is responsible for Pashinyan remaining in power?

**HAKOBYAN:** The National Committee had adopted the strategy of impeaching Pashinyan. *[The National Committee is basically a big-brain brother of ""Vernatun"" created by pro-Russian forces to manage the country after Pashinyan. It's the continuation of their failed 2021 strategy, which in turn was a copycat of a successful strategy executed during the 1st Karabakh war.]* The problem is, if you adopt impeachment as the strategy, especially if it's going to take place as early as October 4 [before the Granada meeting], you are legally required to disclose the name of your candidate for PM.

A few days ago, a ranking army official met me at night and asked me to give the name of our candidate for PM so they could approach and speak with the candidate. People want to know who the proposed replacement is.

**REPORTER:** Does the opposition even know who its candidate is going to be?

**HAKOBYAN:** Look. It's not necessary to politically rape Yerevan [by closing streets]. What we needed was to organize one massive nationwide rally near the Parliament building on October 4th and *force* the ruling party to impeach Pashinyan. We should have adopted Pashinyan's own strategy when he took over the parliament with only 7 MPs. What we see today is not the government defeating the opposition, but the opposition defeating itself.

8/31/2023,France during and after the first Nagorno-Karabakh war,"With France popping up in the news more often these days, I thought it would be interesting to share  this piece of history that some people may not be aware of.  

In April of 1993 the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 822, which I’m sure many here are familiar with. The resolution has a particular passage that specifically mentioned Kəlbəcər.

>Noting with alarm the escalation in armed hostilities and, in particular, the latest invasion of the Kelbadjar district of the Republic of Azerbaijan by local Armenian forces.

The source I linked in this post is a declassified US state department cable from 1993, which actually details how that specific point in the resolution was negotiated, particularly the language “local Armenian forces.”  This is on page 15 of the linked document:

>IN EARLIER INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS, COUNCIL MEMBERS SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME REACHING AGREEMENT ON THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE STATEMENT. AMB. MERIMEE (FRANCE) ASSERTED THAT THE LANGUAGE BEING SUGGESTED BY, INTER ALIA, THE U.S., WAS TOO SPECIFIC IN VIEW OF THE LIMITED INFORMATION COUNCIL MEMBERS HAD ABOUT THE SITUATION. 

It doesn’t reveal what language the United States was suggesting, but the implication is that the Us wanted to name the Republic of Armenia specifically as the aggressor.

>HE ALSO TOOK ISSUE WITH EMPLOYING CHAPTER VII LANGUAGE, SUGGESTING INSTEAD, A CHAPTER VI FORMULATION.

UN chapter VII would have meant UN approval of sanctions or international military force as a coercive measure to ensure the parties comply with the resolution,  while chapter VI only asks the parties to reach a peace agreement.  France did not want UN approval for sanctions and peacekeepers to be used against the aggressors.

>AMB. ALBRIGHT  POINTED OUT THAT ALTHOUGH
SOME OF THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION MAY BE IN DOUBT, THERE WAS NO QUESTIONING THAT AN OFFENSIVE WAS BEING CONDUCTED BY ETHNIC ARMENIAN FORCES IN THE KELBADJAR DISTRICT.

That’s Madeleine Albright, first female Secretary of State for the the US. A very accomplished woman, whose family had escaped both the Nazi and Communist occupations of Czechoslovakia.  She’s also the one who read out this UNSC resolution.

>COUNCIL MEMBERS FINALLY AGREED TO COMPROMISE LANGUAGE FOR THE PARAGRAPH, INCLUDING REFERENCE TO AN INVASION BY “LOCAL ARMENIAN FORCES”

And this is where the implication comes that the United States wanted to name the invaders as either “Armenian Forces” or “Republic of Armenia Forces” and had to compromise due to the objections of France.",1
10/10/2020,@AP: Armenia and Azerbaijan agrees to a Russia-brokered cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh after two weeks of heavy fighting that marked the worst outbreak of hostilities in the separatist region in more than a quarter-century. https://t.co/d1VGEoXzCZ,,1
11/5/2020,"Article | No major power has attempted in earnest to mediate the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis, and some have actively participated in keeping the situation ablaze.","BESA Center Perspectives Paper No. 1,799, November 4, 2020

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: No major power has attempted in earnest to mediate the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis, and some have actively participated in keeping the situation ablaze. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan have been actively preparing for hostilities, but Armenia finds itself at a political and military disadvantage.

Anyone who has been following world politics for the past 30 years must feel overwhelmed these days by déja vu. At times it seems as though decades-old headlines are being recycled.

The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh is one example of this phenomenon. The conflict was artificially created by the Soviets, starting with Stalin, who paid special attention to the Caucasus and the drawing of its borders in order to ensure that nobody there would feel confident, secure, or satisfied. The clash flared up in the last years of Soviet Union, culminating in direct military conflict and an Armenian victory—and both sides thoroughly exhausted.

That did not end the conflict, which continued to simmer and occasionally reached boiling point. No major power seriously attempted to mediate the crisis, and some actively participated in keeping it ablaze. Both sides have been actively preparing for the resumption of hostilities, but it is now Armenia that finds itself at a political and military disadvantage.

In the early days of the conflict, Armenia made a strategic decision to align itself with Russia and its interests in the region. That approach paid huge dividends in the early 1990s, with Russia aiding Armenia with military equipment, training, and even direct assistance to ensure that it would emerge victorious in the war with Azerbaijan. This over-reliance on Russia continued to be the main pillar of Armenian foreign policy, culminating in a defense pact between Armenia and Russia. Only a few months ago, the countries held joint military exercises with thousands of troops from both countries involved.

But Russia is never playing with only one deck. Over the last few decades it has become a major supplier of military hardware to Azerbaijan as well as Armenia, and has become a major economic partner of that oil-rich Caspian country. Armenia, when compared to Azerbaijan, is relatively poor. Given the duplicity of Russia’s interests, Yerevan is thus left at a significant disadvantage in this political triangle.

That is not Armenia’s only failure. Another, and perhaps even larger, strategic mistake is the country’s relative isolation on the world stage. This is especially striking given the established and financially successful Armenian diaspora in the West, particularly in France and the US. These communities, which are prosperous and politically influential, have nevertheless failed to articulate Armenia’s security concerns for their respective governments and the general public. In its powerful diaspora, Armenia possesses strategic leverage that only a few small countries can boast, but that advantage has been wasted.

This represents a catastrophic blunder on the part of successive Armenian governments and is a clear indicator of their strategic blindness. Even with Armenia’s recent attempts at warming its relationship with the US and Europe, Western public opinion is unfamiliar with the conflict and not ready to accept the arguments of either side. Armenia’s friendly relationship with Iran does not help its world standing either, but one can argue that in that region countries are not necessarily at liberty to be picky about their friends.

Azerbaijan has oil. It is a country run by a single family, the Aliyevs. It is a Shiite-majority fiefdom run along the lines of the UAE, but with an inept and kleptocratic authoritarian regime. That regime has been on a major arms-buying spree, purchasing arms from Russia and recently from Israel.

On a strategic level, Armenia is in conflict with Turkey, not Azerbaijan. Certain sectors of Turkey, with President Erdoğan as their representative, have never made peace with the fact that they failed to finish off Armenia completely. Turkey’s involvement in this conflict thus contains a pathological aspect.

Erdoğan, with his revanchist imperial strategy, wants to present Turkey as the defender of all Muslim and Turkic people. But in the Caucasus, his ambitions clash with similar imperial sentiments held by Vladimir Putin. This rivalry is as old as both respective empires.

If one is to believe recent reports, Ankara is ramping up its direct involvement in the conflict. It allegedly shot down Armenian SU-25s in Armenian air space and is recruiting and sending Syrian mercenaries to the area in an attempt to replicate the approach it took in Libya.

Everyone is awaiting Russia’s response—but Putin is very careful, and he has apparently calculated that he will not step into this quagmire despite Moscow’s military agreement with Armenia. The conflict, after all, plays into his strategy for the regions surrounding Russia, in what the Kremlin calls the “near far.”

Russia’s goal is to destabilize its neighbors by creating semi-independent states that are quietly stage-managed by Moscow, giving the Kremlin the power to control the political temperature in those countries. Russia may want to sustain the current conflict for a little while for the purpose of weakening Armenia a bit more and then coming in as peacemaker. The end result would render Armenia even more dependent on Russia than it is already.

Russia will not allow Armenia to crush Azerbaijan, as doing so would provoke Turkey to openly enter the conflict—which in turn would force Russia to intervene directly. Sadly, a peaceful resolution to this conflict—if one is even possible—is not currently on the table.

2/22/2021,"Second Nagorno Karabakh war and its political implications: The Rise of the Osmans, and Bear's humiliation","With the current Caucasian sphere slowing down and becoming more stable, it is now acceptable for me to give out my analysis of the geopolitical proxy war that was the second Karabakh war, and its implications geopolitically. 

We will chronologically rank every country that had won the most in this war. Enjoy the wall of text. 

**Azerbaijan**

The war went extremely favorably from not just the military front, but also geopolitical. Prior to the second war, Aliyev and Azerbaijan was doing horribly and was being embarrassed by Armenia and its military that even Killdim would have blushed. 

But everything changed after the November 9 agreements, giving Azerbaijan 4 remaining whole rayons without a fight, and getting Matghis in their territory despite not being under their control, Azerbaijan got the emperor's share in this war and was practically being showered in victories for themselves. 

However, despite what people think, the Azerbaijani military itself did horrendously in this war due to their poor preparation, and was deeply reliant on Turkish advisors for proper military support, but it was Aliyev that had all the victories by the end.

Aliyev's regime was never doing well prior to the war, it was economically stagnant and has not recovered from the 2014 economic downturn in oil despite being 6 years after it. Aliyev's regime is very weak after the Armenian velvet revolution happened as it was encouraging the people to revolt against them, meanwhile their military did horribly in the July battles against Armenia, furthermore, this embarrassment continued with the late September battles where the Armenian military pretty much crippled the entire attack force of Azerbaijan in just 5 days (although we lost a lot of guys too from those battles). 

Postwar, Aliyev has won many medals and much honor from his population, every mistake he has done has pardoned him with all of his crimes and corruption, he won, and he got 7 rayons, Shushi and Hadrut all at the same time (without Armenians ofcourse!) Not just that, but Azerbaijan can now peacefully threaten Kapan, Goris and many Armenians in Syunik and humiliate their weaker rival in the most satisfying way possible. They can take the Sotk goldmine and intimidate the Armenians with their superior military and superior equipment, while the Armenian government is in disarray, embarrassing itself by awkwardly doing totalitarian moves by recently arresting some of their opponents, while My step's members are leaving by the dozens. And yes, Armenia is suffering the further loss of the Hin Tagher areas and suffering brutal massacres of their military under the Azerbaijani army.

The world has seen Aliyev and Azerbaijan's might, and they are impressed by their miracle drone tactics and their total victory against their old opponent by killing 4000 of their soldiers. 

**Future**

Ilham Aliyev's rule has pretty much been assured for the next 8-10 years, while the first fives years will have nothing but praise, the last five years will be all but turmoil from all three sides, military, economic and political. 

Our favorite Aliyev puppet and leader and head of Caspian Report SeaSnakeX had made a great quote 

*It is easier to tear a country down than it is to rebuild one.*

And indeed this is the problem that Ilham Aliyev has pulled himself into, he has mainly three problems to deal with and, realistically only one can be dealt with.

Internally, speaking there are three more problems that are going to take 4 Russian loans to fix just for one to be even remotely be considered fixed. The first and easiest will be military, this is not a large problem, but a significant number of LAV's, tanks and AFV as well as the special forces core has been completely wiped clean from the earth. Not a big issue, but with dwindling money, fixing this problem will be valuable in the long run, but not beneficial for the main problems for Azerbaijan that they are currently suffering from.

The two remaining problems will be the biggest undertaking Azerbaijan can ever do to just complete one of them.

The seven Rayons are a great victory, but a great expense for Azerbaijan to rebuild themselves, realistically, Azerbaijan will need to spend up to 3 billion dollars to just get these Rayons into a functional area, and that is not accounting for the absolute shit-storm tier military problems they are facing in Kelbajar. People think Syunik and Artsakh are a security problem, but really, it is Kelbajar that is going to be the most vulnerable area in the whole of Caucasia, that place needs to house at least 80,000 people alone, and have decent quality of living, and have decent military on top of that, and that is still counting housing another 520,000 refugees from the 7 rayons that need security, jobs and proper governance. 

The 7 Rayons are a big problem, but when your economy is so dysfunctional it makes the Armenian economy in the 90's looks good. Azerbaijan with its heavy oil reliance has led to complete economic failure for Azerbaijan. Aliyev's economic policy of just relying on oil prices has left Azerbaijan into a banana republic, diversification plans have utterly failed to even remotely give proper growth and 90% of their export revenue is still under oil. Even if Azerbaijan had a competent economic team (which they barely do) it would take ***years*** for Azerbaijan to get out of its oil dependency. For some perspective, both Armenia and Georgia, *after 25 fucking years*, have  50-70% of their economy be related to either mining or agriculture, and most of their industry is heavily support by agriculture and imports, and these economies are vastly better and more developed, and what Azerbaijan is aiming for these 10 years to get to. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's agricultural muscle (its historical advantage) represents only 3% at best in its export base, all of it is going to Russia.

While oil prices are suspected to increase and peak in the 2040's, they will all exclusively be in the developing third world (Africa and India), most nations like China, and Europe are heading towards alternative energy, this is where Azerbaijan exports the most, further making the Azerbaijani economy even more screwed than it already is. Mind you, Azerbaijan will not be the only one in this situation, Saudi Arabia is even more screwed over. 

The question is *if* Azerbaijan collapses economically, ***it's when***. I can't predict that unfortunately, best case scenario is a great depression, worst case, 90% of what Venezuela is suffering right now in 7 years. 

Do you think problems like these are near crisis level? We are not even getting into the nation's internal and geopolitical problems yet.

The real issue for Aliyev is hereditary, who is going to succeed him? Emil Samanyan suggested his wife Mehraba Aliyeva, but Azerbaijan is as macho and male dominated as Armenian leadership is right now, so if she is the leader of Azerbaijan, she will be a short regent, no one wants a fucking Tik-toker run Azerbaijan with plastic surgeons on her everyday. The real successor to Azerbaijan will be Heydar Aliyev (not the one who died in 2003) We know very little of Heydar, the kid is barely older than me by 2 years, and he does not look fit for a leader currently, but in 10 years, maybe. This is the same kid who bought a shit load of mansions at age 14 in 2012 by the way. The problem with Heydar is that when he does take power in 10 years when his father steps down due to his unpopularity, he will be a in a world with a hostile Azerbaijani population, with less experience and a much worse position his father was in 2003 than he was, the geopolitical atmosphere will have changed vastly, and much less to Azerbaijan's favour in the future.  

Geopolitically, Azerbaijan is as isolated and alone as Armenia and Georgia is, the West doesn't care about them, and the rest of the planet barely acknowledge that each one exists, the West is a no go anymore. This leads to Azerbaijan's real ally to be its recent Turkish alliance. Turkey will be a good and bad thing, the good thing is all of the given things that Azerbaijan has problems with can be resolved by 10 Turkish loans each. The problem with that is Turkey will demand more political control in Azerbaijan, furthermore, any point of Turkish influence will always be met by Russian hostilities as they will see Azerbaijan as another Georgia, a traitor and a puppet. Iran will be even more hostile to Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani relations are even worse with Iran currently than they have ever been with the recent changes of the geopolitical front. 

**This is the price of victory.**

&#x200B;

**Russia**

The mighty Russian, once seen as the power of the Caucasus has been shaken by the Osmans Turks.

Russia did very poorly in this war, their perceived inactivity in the eyes of their allies (Armenia) was not a good image, but there is far more to this than what meets the eye.

Russian policy was to keep the balance of power in the Caucasus, Russia enjoyed the status quo because they were the mediators and jockeys of the conflict, they were very wary of Azerbaijan, but as long as they satisfied them with favorable promises such as returning the 7 rayons, it would have been enough. Unfortunately, Russia's power has been waning for decades. Georgia and Moldova were the first traitors to abandon Russia, and were punished as a result of their disloyalty. Russia further became weary as its Central Asian subjects began shifting into their own interests and not in Russia with Uzbekistan being an example and Turkimenistan, a growing disloyal power, and Tajikistan and Kyrgistan, becoming a sphere in China rather than Russia. This left Russia even more xenophobic and feared more of its own allies were beginning to desert them.

At the same time, Russia knew very well that Azerbaijan's recent military investment in the late 2000's and early 2010's were alarming as the balance of power shifted towards Azerbaijan.

Russia began a program of financing the Armenian military by giving Armenia 3 loans and a military arms deal, with a military discount on top, this puts the amount of military investment the Russians gave to the Armenians were close to **1.5 billion dollars from 2014-present.** Russia is still continuing to invest in Armenia as they know they are a *""Loyal""* ally so far.  

But remember when I said how weary Russia had become? **Russia could not trust Armenia to hold the balance of power**, Russia's heavy handed tactics of hard power was not effective and the geopolitical front in the Caucasus will be met with hostilities with **Turkey** Russia feared that if a resolution could arrive, it would make Armenia leave Russia's sphere of influence, ending Russian supremacy in the Caucasus altogether. Therefore, Russian policy changed to the Madrid principles. This change in stance was clear by 2016 when Serzh Sargsyan began realizing that Russia would no longer be willing to help Armenia in the Artsakh war, keeping a mediating stance to the war (despite Russia losing power as a result). Russia still favored Armenia mind you, ***but they wanted themselves in control***. 

The war caught the Russians off guard. The Turks were in Azerbaijan and they no longer had power in Azerbaijan, this was a disaster. Not just the Russians could not make a military response, but also had no capable way of defeating the powerful Tb2's effectively. This left Russia in a humiliating and embarrassing stance in the war, they essentially wrote the Lavrov plan to give a compromise to Azerbaijan so that they can remove the Azerbaijanis from the Turkey's grasps. 

What makes it ever more humiliating for Russia is that most of the military tech Armenia had, was all from Russia and made by Russia. **All of it was destroyed from a couple of Turkish drones. These weren't 60's weaponry, they were 90's-2000's systems built to fight some powerful tech.**

**After pressuring Armenia to do the Lavrov plan, they had gained, basically half of Artsakh, and turning Armenia into a complete dependency to Russia.** 

The Lavrov plan was very insidious, it gave legal precedence for Russian occupation of Artsakh and complete control of it, and expunged Turkey from even remotely being part of it. Russia basically pulled the rug on Turkey by making their own *""brothers""* betray them by signing the Lavrov plan, screwing them over. 

**Future**

This is a Russian victory, no doubt, Russia had tricked the Osmans and made their Azerbaijani puppets be on their side temporarily, however, Russia is not going to be masterful planer as we think, nor are they this malevolent deity that can dominate the Caucasus, take nothing but cowardice for their act of treachery for leaving their only loyal ally for dead in this war.

Russia has no power over Armenia, but they have power over Artsakh, and that is enough to keep the Armenians in their sphere for decades. Decades, will not be this status quo unfortunately.

**Russia is growing weaker by the day, and this war only made them breath a little longer.**

Russia's diplomatic failure and heavy reliance of hardpower has led to them to total diplomatic collapse of all of their allies. Russia needs to understand that they are not the USSR anymore, they are a pathetic power that had just thrown their own ally to the ground and ran away from their own backyard being pillaged by an idiot from Ankara, and yet, all they do is throw territory for appeaset to Azerbaijan? Appeasement only shows you can't fight.

**Russia knows this, they don't like it.** 

Russia has tried to make the Armenians happy by trying to take some territory in Shushi to make Azerbaijani habitability in Shushi impossible, but also open the border for Armenia to benefit from it. All of this is purely the benefit of Armenia, Azerbaijan has no reason not to trade with their sworn enemy. 

As an Armenian myself to any Russian lurker here, let me tell you this how we feel.

**Do you think a patch of land, and opening the borders are going to make us not betray you after the Karabakh conflict is resolved because of your cowardice in this war? The Armenians no longer want to be part of Russia anymore, they despise them and find them unreliable and cowardly. They are now a disloyal ally only there for Artsakh, they will not stop any minute until Artsakh is under their rule no matter what.**

Russia knows this to, that's why they are keeping Artsakh hostage. They want bloodthirsty revenge to the Turks, and particularly, Azerbaijan for humiliating them, and making them do what they did to their only bastion of Russian influence (Armenia). 

Russia will not threaten Armenia, it's too risky, removing and installing Kocharyan will spell the end of Russian influence as the Armenian population is outright hostile to Russia right now. As for Azerbaijan, you may as well consider the 5 year occupation as a deadline for Azerbaijan, if Azerbaijan continues in its direction with Turkey by the end of 2025, Russia will become a threat to Azerbaijan. 

**There will be a war, it will be started by Russia or Azerbaijan, it depends on who is pathetic enough to do it.**  

&#x200B;

**Georgia**

Georgia got nothing and lost nothing in this war, but it is now in the worst geopolitical position in the Caucasus, even worse than Armenia. 

Georgia dreamt of being on the side of the West, but the West doesn't care about Georgia, this left Georgia as a defenseless nation with no response to Russian aggression in the Caucasus. Georgia's only real allies in the Caucasus are Armenia and Azerbaijan, they are brothers to them, but when their brothers are killing each other and joining the enemies that Georgia is trying to keep away from is difficult to impossible.

Georgia tried to keep a neutral ground, but was quickly intimidated by Turkey to be loyal to them, Georgia did nothing, Georgia can do nothing in this conflict.

**Future**

Georgia is the most isolated country of the three Caucasian states, Georgia has, realistically, two options, one is drinking two cups of lava, and the other is getting shot four times. 

The first option is drinking lava, negotiating with Russia will be a humiliating deal for the Georgians, they gave them ruin, and all they're doing is sucking up to the Russians, angering Turkey and becoming a Russian puppet with no policy of its own. Russia will oppress the Georgian people, but not kill the democratic government. Hey, at least you got Abkhazia and South Ossetia back! 

The second option is getting gun downed basically, but Georgia can survive as long as it finds a way to stop the bleeding from Russian and Turkish wounds. Joining the newly forming Turkish Hegemony is not a bad idea, but it's the least bad option Georgia finds itself in, this will always make Russia become a threat no matter what and make Georgia, basically become a dependency for Turkish defense against Russian aggression. The Turks are a danger to Georgia, take no doubt, but it's better than being a puppet to the Russians.

**Georgia must pick a side**

And it literally will be the Switzerland of the Caucasus, this country is flawless in domestic and internal manners, Democracy is great baby.

&#x200B;

**Iran**

Iran is the sleeping giant in this conflict, it is the ""Third option"" or the ""Wild Card"" Iran is the Shia power that is slowly turning into a hegemon of its own, although its economy has done poorly as a result of the US, Iran is a beast that not even the Turks can take on alone without sacrificing an arm and a leg. 

For some truth, Iran has always favoured the Armenians over the Azerbaijanis, Iran sees Azerbaijan (especially right now) as nothing but a Turkish wannabe and a puppet of Turkey against Iranian interest. 

Therefore, the war came at a complete surprise to Iran as it did to Russia when they realised it was orchestrated by the Turks. **The Iranians were always in a hands-off attitude to the conflict as long as there was no large scale war, and as long as Russia kept Turkey out of the Caucasus.**

Well then, things have changed for the worse. Geopolitically, Iran see's Azerbaijan as a complete security threat to themselves, and Turkey is the main opponent, with Russia potentially making an exit from the conflict or from the horizon entirely, and being humiliated by the Turkish army is an extremely alarming sign for Iran, as Turkey is essentially becoming the next Sunni power that they must defeat or try limiting its influence. 

Iran is currently cooking up a plan probably to know what they are trying to do in the Caucasus and what type of investments can they make, their main role will be trying to limit the growing Turkish influence happening in Syria, Iraq, Israel, Egypt and now Azerbaijan, all of it choking Iran's western empire. 

**Future**

Muhammed Javad Zariff is an excellent diplomat, but his statements and opinions towards Armenia and Azerbaijan represent an excellent view on what Iran thinks.

""We are happy for the liberated territories""

Iran has consistently always demanded that the Armenians withdraw from the 7 rayons, and here, Iran is happy to see the 600,000 people (100,000 are from Armenia and they will never get their homes back.) get their homes back. Unfortunately, it is the only agreement both the Azerbaijanis and Iranians can agree on.

""Armenia's territorial integrity is the red line to Iran""

As a young analyst, ***this was by far the most aggressive Iran has ever been in the Caucasus***, this statement proves that Iran is extremely unhappy of the changes of the Status-quo, and fear Turkish dominance in the Caucasus with Azerbaijan as its fortress. Iran therefore, will put in great priority to arm and protect Armenia from any type of aggression from Turkey or Azerbaijan, ***Artsakh included*****. They want status from Artsakh, and not an autonomous republic in Azerbaijan.** 

*Iran will not be an ally of Russia, Russia won't be an ally of Iran, but both will have similar interests of keeping Turkish influence out of the Caucasus, with the help of the Armenians. Interests are priority, not idealism.*

**Iran will become a very large player in the future of the third war, they will be on the Armenian side, not Russian.** 

&#x200B;

**Turkey**

*The Osman terror*. Let me be very honest with you, **Turkey was the one responsible for the second Karabakh war, nothing is even remotely proving that Turkey was not the reason why Aliyev got so cocky in this war.** 

Turkey is the mastermind of this war, and was the military victor of this war, they had not just crushed the pathetic Armenians, but also humiliated the Russians on the geopolitical front, the Russian went flying and cowering in fear when TB2's began to dominate the skies of Artsakh, under the Turkish flag the Azerbaijanis walked in victory. The flags, mercenaries, drones and commandos, all came from Turkey themselves, they are the masterminds of this war after all.

So why did Turkey do it? 

Ultranationalism..... ^(and they got nothing out of it.) 

*Turkish leadership currently seems to be extremely competent at running Turkey into the ground.* 

I cannot fucking imagine what on earth was the megalomaniac decisions of Erdogan is at throwing Turkey into basically three fucking fronts, and losing all three of them at the same time, and, somehow, pissing off Russia, France, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Balkans and making the USA and EU more hostile. Seriously, Erdogan is the worst leader in the Caucasian front and has completely drowned himself in Turanistic Neo-Ottoman delusions, fascists and near Hitlerian levels of racism. 

If one can literally see the timeline of Turkey, Turkey literally did what Germany did before WW2 in just 8 fucking months. 

Original Turkish policy was to never get itself involved against stronger or equal powers, the Caucasus is essentially an arena of Iran and Russia, all that don't like Turkey. Not just that, but Turkey's main objective was to extend its influence in the Balkans and the Middle east, which itself is very challenging as the nation faces equally powerful foes such as Egypt.

Hilariously, Mr. Erdogan decided to throw all of that away, and pretty much go the same way Germany did in 1938, and decide to be militarily aggressive by joining in more proxy wars and break their heads into territory they have rarely found themselves into. Turkey is a powerhouse, but Turkey cannot fight 4 other regional superpowers at once, and therefore, becomes an easy scapegoat and a boogeyman for all.

**As for the karabakh war, do you know what they got at the end after spending what could be 200 million dollars? A fucking joint Russian-Turkish monitoring base in a city that won't be function in maybe five years? (Agdam) Erdogan is the real clown here.**

**Future**

The Turks need to re-analyze how to properly handle their newly owned subjects like Georgia, Azerbaijan and Israel currently, being an idealistic moron and believing in brotherly turanism is going make Turkey look like Nazi Germany, which would give an easy casus bellie for every nation that wants Turkey gone. 

Turkey will still get Azerbaijan, however, being charitable is and should not be an option, donate when Azerbaijan is willing to give more concessions than it is worth, and always keep Turkish interests at heart, just because Azerbaijan is your *""brother""* doesn't mean excluding them from the rest of your dependencies, because your Turkic brother just threw you under the Lavrov plan bus and you got nothing out of it, do not be too feeble next time to be tricked again ffs. 

Overall, Turkey will continue to become a growing power in the Caucasus, their dependencies of Georgia and Azerbaijan leave only one little Caucasian state left, it is Armenia. 

Turkey has much reason to negotiate and make a few concessions, because if they can make a few concessions like allowing Armenia to have Artsakh, and recognize the Armenian Genocide, it will give an insane amount of power in the Caucasus, ***essentially becoming the new Turkish Backyard.*** Turkey is a powerful foe for Armenia, but Turkey see's Armenia as the last opponent to bring into their empire, and once they do, **the Russians will be defenseless.** 

&#x200B;

**Turkey has much to conquer and much to dominate, but a leadership change and a change in mentality to follow world standards will make Turkey become a superpower if they do it.**

&#x200B;

**Armenia**

Armenia, the big fat loser of this war, we got all of it. We lost Artsakh as a result of the Lavrov plan, Azerbaijanis humiliated us in Syunik, and currently protests are happening on a daily basis by the 17 parties (RoboSerzh), the oligarchs smell blood, and the Armenians are bleeding from every orifice that is being created everyday. 

It doesn't stop there, the economic situation of Armenia has deteriorated as a result of 30-40,000 Armenian refugees from Artsakh, meanwhile, the Covid-19 epeidemic has killed 4000 people and has infected another 160,000 people, poor policy is a result. The country is in chaos and is sombering as their defeat from an overwhelming Turkish backed Azerbaijani force has crushed them.

Their armies buried, their allies betrayed them. The only thing that is even remotely positive for Armenia is that it isn't falling into a Syrian civil war and be invaded by aliens, hell has come and the world collapsed under Armenia. It seems pretty bleak.

**Future**

The future looks about the same as what we had before the war...

Do you think anything for Armenia has changed? **Russia doesn't want Pashinyan gone why would they?** Kocharyan and the 17 parties will utterly fail because half the population already supports Pashinyan, and 2/3rds of Armenia see the 17 parties as nothing but incompetent and corrupt fools. People don't want Pashinyan, but 100% don't want Roboserzh to be back, and that pretty much leaves Armenian democracy in a gray zone of uncertainty. 

The Armenians really haven't had a problem with economic reform and good governance ever since Serzh Sargsyan came to power.

Serzh Sargsyan, while a corrupt leader no doubt, he pretty much pulled Armenia from a thug infested dumpster fire, to an emerging economy, his excellent decision making made Armenia go above and beyond the horizon and put Armenia on the road to developing industry, AI, IT, and giving Armenia some nice drones of his own. Pashinyan came to power, changed nothing and dialed anti-corruption by 900% and gave Armenia a booming prosperous economy by 2019, our economy before the epidemic was 10% year-on-year.

The future internally looks bright for Armenia, the nation will develop its excellent industry and will most likely end up just like Georgia in 5 years, in 10 years. Despite all the doom and gloom, Armenia and Georgia will be centres of excellence in the Caucasus, and we will see this in the future. 

There are however, two real issues Armenia has to resolve.

The first issue are the elections in 2024.

The delay is excellent because it gives more time for a proper and new opposition to rise up, and potentially replace My Step (My step won't go away, just become a powerful opposition party). There is a big problem for this, as Eric hacopian has said, we are all fine with who participates in the government, **as long as the previous government isn't in power or has connections. We really don't want these idiots in power, they put Armenia in this position and made us weaker in the long run.** 

Armenia will pretty much end up like Georgia, as long My Step doesn't get too shady or become another HHK in those 3 years. 

The second problem is geopolitical, and it is not good.

A proxy war is inevitable between Russia and Turkey, and Armenia will be in the frontlines, Artsakh is at stake and the Russians are all but happy to never give us back Artsakh as long as they want, we must make concessions and forget about the 7 rayons. We must negotiate with the Azerbaijanis and get Shushi and Hadrut and Talish back from them, we have lost so much, and slacking off is what lead to us in our defeat against Turkey.

Russia should not be trusted, if Artsakh is free and under Armenian control, **leave the Russians, they have become a security threat to our nation.** 

Don't worry about Syunik, Syunik is so heavily protected by Iranian and Russian interests that even the USA in the 90's would never touch it, worry about our institutions, leadership and foreign policy, we are isolated and we are damn well not going to become another Georgia.

**And next time, I don't want to see 4000 new graves.** We lost badly, and it came at a large cost to us. 

**This is the price of total defeat.** 

Conclusion

It took me a good 3 hours to write this up, I have been thinking about the future in every possible scenario, and this is what lead to my research, the future looks harsh for everyone, and we, as a people, as a nation, must always prepare for the worst.

I couldn't figure out why they were being so hostile to us and doing weird shit like founding organisations like the ""Hindu American Foundation"" when they are Christian? We have never interacted with them and didn't even know they existed.

Well I did some research since then and it's all apparently to do with this land they stole and occupied called Nagorno-Karabakh that was recently liberated? I read up on the genocides and massacres and my heart sank for you guys. 

What bothered me is that even though you guys had suffered more than them, you did not go seeking revenge and were still patient with them in the hopes that they would be fair and return your land through diplomacy (even if it was just the surrounding areas) but they didn't care. 

Reading up on the recent war I am so happy for you guys having got the land back and Nagorno-Karabakh. So just wanted to say congratulations. Your story has a lot of similarity with Kashmir (we've only managed to liberate about 40% of it, China liberated 20% and the rest is occupied by India). 

Inshallah one day we'll liberate Kashmir too just like you guys did. Your story honestly gave me hope :)",1

##U.S. supports sending an international mission to ensure the security of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians; Russia responds

The U.S. and Armenia want to send an international mission to Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia isn't so sure.

**U.S. STATE DEPT:** Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh should be able to remain and live in their homes in peace and dignity. They should be allowed to safely return to their homes and their passage should be overseen by a neutral 3rd party. Azerbaijan has a responsibility to protect civilians and ensure the humane treatment of all, including those it suspects of being combatants.

We believe there should be an international mission to provide transparency, reassurance, and confidence to the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh and the international community, that their rights and security will be protected. //

**KREMLIN:** Any mission to Karabakh is possible only with the permission of the government of Azerbaijan. We have not yet seen any concrete suggestions by the U.S. to send an observation mission. Russia is already on the ground. //

##Russia to Armenia: don't forget that we sell you gas for a discount price

**PUTIN'S OFFICE:** The economic cooperation between Russia and Armenia plays a key role in Armenia's development. It's far greater than the AM-US cooperation. Also don't forget the cheap gas we sell to Armenia.

##Why is it difficult for Armenia to leave CSTO? Ranking member of the ruling party explains 

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan says Armenia's defense partnership is insufficient yet Armenia is still a member of CSTO. Are you discussing the topic of exiting CSTO?

**ARMEN KHACHATRYAN:** Of course there are extensive discussions but leaving CSTO is not a simple task. Armenia has since signed numerous agreements with CSTO and interstate agreements. Everything needs to be addressed separately. Currently, we do not see any benefit in a quick exit from CSTO. We have to weigh the benefits and risks. There is currently no legal process to launch the exit.

**REPORTER:** According to USAID's Samantha Power, Pashinyan has made concrete proposals for AM-US cooperation. What can you tell us about Pashinyan's letter to the White House? 

**KHACHATRYAN:** I haven't read the content but Armenia wants to strengthen its security. The U.S. could help. The 13 September 2022 attack on Armenia was stopped with the help of a phone call from the U.S. Currently, the only state that's capable of countering Turkey and Azerbaijan to maintain peace in our region is the U.S.

##Armenian parliament will discuss the ratification of the Rome Statute in a first hearing next week 

The 4-day session begins on October 3. Prior to this, a parliamentary commission will have to first approve the draft bill on September 28.

Armenia says it's a step to hold Azerbaijani war criminals accountable that could also serve as a restraining force. Russia says it's a step against Russia.

**RULING PARTY MP:** We are going to ratify it. The team agrees. The International Criminal Court was formed primarily to respond to acts of genocide and crimes against humanity. We see a textbook example of ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh today. We must ratify the Statute now so we can bring the perpetrators to justice. Sooner or later Ilham Aliyev is going to face justice. 

**REPORTER:** How will Russia respond to the ratification of the Rome Statute?

**RULING PARTY MP:** The Russian military is highly dissatisfied by the political decisions made by the Kremlin when it comes to the inaction towards Azerbaijani aggression. There is a political decision not to assist Armenia. 

Sure, there would be more heated diplomatic exchanges after the ratification, but it's already brazen as it is. Some Russian officials and media figures have made impudent statements. I advise my Russian colleagues to restrain and shut the mouths of Margarita Simonyan and the likes of her. Even those Armenians who have long viewed Russia as an ally are making a 180-degree turn after statements made by the likes of Margarita Simonyan. Shut their mouths.

Even after 2018, Armenia took steps to strengthen AM-RU relations. This is why people with a friendly attitude to Russia were appointed as defense officials in Armenia. Some of them were USSR-era officials and figures. 

**REPORTER:** But Pashinyan appointed Armen Grigoryan [strongly pro-West] as the head of the National Security Council, against Russia's will.

**RULING PARTY MP:** Hello? Is every appointee supposed to be Russia's pick? Ա՜յ քեզ բան․ Why should Russia itself pick and choose whom we appoint? We have taken reasonable steps to maintain good AM-RU relations but today we see that Russia is not a guarantor of Armenia's security. We saw the outcome of the Turkish-Russian-Azeri agreement in Nagorno-Karabakh. This is the turning point. What should we thank Russia for?

**REPORTER:** What about the situation around Syunik and Azerbaijan's ""corridor"" demands?

**RULING PARTY MP:** Russia is not helping us to protect Syunik. Quite the contrary. I won't open the parenthesis. We must very quickly invite the international community to act as a restraining force.

##USAID chief about the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh:

**SAMANTHA POWER:** During the 9 months that the government of Azerbaijan blocked this corridor, it created excruciating humanitarian conditions for the people. The government of Azerbaijan shut out access to humanitarian organizations and independent eyes.

The military attacks of last week have made a dire situation even worse. It is absolutely critical that humanitarian orgs are granted full and unimpeded access through the Lachin corridor into the villages and towns of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The U.S. will provide $11.5M in humanitarian assistance to provide everything from food to psycho-social support, and to help reunite many unaccompanied children with their families.

**REPORTER:** Will the U.S. impose sanctions on Azerbaijan or Aliyev for the ethnic cleansing?

**SAMANTHA POWER:** I'm here to gather the facts and testimonies and pass the info to the White House after which a decision will be made on how to respond. There are a range of options under active consideration. I look forward to bringing back the experience and testimonies and being able to describe to my colleagues in government just how grave the circumstances have been for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.

##independent analysts from Azerbaijan have so far identified 200 Azeri soldiers killed during their aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh

The list of full names was published by Meydan TV.

##290 wounded, 125 dead, dozens still missing after yesterday's fuel storage explosion near Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert 

Context in [Monday report](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/16s89r7/exodus_of_armenians_out_of_nagornokarabakh/). Several patients died in a hospital in Stepanakert due to insufficient medical intervention as a result of Azerbaijan's blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

The following day helicopters and ambulances were allowed to enter from Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh with the help of the Red Cross and Russian peacekeepers to evacuate the patients. Azerbaijan sent a van with medicine.

Armenian TV personality [Mane Grigoryan's](https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/270092) brother is missing after the explosion. He was waiting in line to get fuel.

A team led by the British medical doctor Steven Jeffrey from the Royal Army Medical Corps will visit Armenia to treat the patients evacuated out of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

France will send medical equipment to Armenia in the coming hours.

##... what caused the explosion?

The area where the drivers formed a queue for fuel is the size of a soccer pitch. People would approach with their buckets to receive fuel. Since the area was very smelly, some residents preferred to stay away and have the buckets transferred to them. 

The smokers were being told to stay behind barbwires. Eyewitnesses report seeing 3 smokers, but they were standing far away.

Two employees worked on the reservoir. One of them took care of air ventilation, while the other was presumably helping to fill the buckets. 

A witness reports that the air ventilation hole began sucking air inwards. He realized an explosion was about to happen. The blast threw people in different directions. 

There were multiple explosions. Some people had an opportunity to escape from subsequent explosions. They witnessed flames coming out of wells. At some point, the explosions stopped and only fires were left. 

Possible causes:

(1) Eyewitnesses report seeing lightning strikes that reached near the ground that day, but this fuel storage comes equipped with special devices that protect against lightning. 

(2) Smokers were observed but the distance was quite far.

(3) Someone did something inside the reservoir.

(4) ...

##Turkey and Azerbaijan will build a Kars-Nakhijevan railway, will use Iran as a corridor ""if Armenia doesn't want to be part of the Middle Corridor"": agreement signed 

The leaders of Turkey and Azerbaijan met in Nakhijevan on Tuesday to sign three agreements. Two were about jointly building housing in a Turkish region affected by earthquake, and an energy cooperation.

**ERDOGAN:** The signing of the protocol of intent to build the Kars-Nakhijevan railway is also a historical event. I'm confident this railway will become a branch in the part of the Middle Corridor [China-Europe].

If Yerevan doesn't agree for the railway to pass through Armenia, it will travel through Iran instead. Iran is open to the idea. We could create a road to Azerbaijan through Iran.

Having road and railway connections between Nakhijevan and the rest of Azerbaijan is a priority for both Turkey and Azerbaijan. It will strengthen our relations. We will do everything possible to open this corridor as soon as possible. A car or a train departing from Baku could go straight to Kars. It is nice to see positive signals from Iran in this matter. //

Azerbaijan said it would provide humanitarian aid to the Karabakh population. The EU wants this process to be transparent and monitored by international actors.

EU also wants Azerbaijan to clarify its vision for Karabakh Armenians' future as part of Azerbaijan. //

##interview with Armenian parliament's Defense Committee chief Andranik Kocharyan (ruling party)

**REPORTER:** What happened in Stepanakert? 

**ANDRANIK:** Murky and childish processes that began with the landing of Ruben Vardanyan. Then we see mysterious gatherings and dinners. Then the resignations of parliament president and president Arayik, and the transfer of power to ARF. The opposition forces in Armenia clapped and cheered: *""Arayik is gone. We can finally defend Karabakh.""* Then we got the war. 

The only party that didn't take part in the coup was Samvel Babayan. He had earlier presented a plan to find common ground with Azerbaijan. It could have allowed the preservation of many institutions in Nagorno-Karabakh. A mutual understanding was reached with Azerbaijan around 13 of the 15 points of the document. The other 2, pertaining to the fate of the Defense Army, were yet to be negotiated and finalized.

However, the Clan rejected Babayan's negotiation efforts and the Western platform. Nothing was good enough for them. They ran to capitulate in Yevlakh immediately after the attack. 

Now we see how all the weapons accumulated by the Defense Army with great effort for many years are being surrendered today. Moreover, the Clan backstabbed Armenia by agreeing to the language of the documents stating that Armenia had soldiers inside Nagorno-Karabakh.

Samvel Babayan was able to successfully move from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia yesterday. This is very encouraging, the only legitimate leader of Nagorno-Karabakh is now located in Armenia. The Clan in Stepanakert must be held accountable for the anti-Armenian agreement. 

They must also explain to the War Commission why they gave away all the weapons instead of destroying them, or better yet, why they were unable to utilize the broad range of armament at their disposal. Here are some possible options: (1) Someone forced them not to destroy the weapons. (2) Certain individuals personally benefitted from the surrender of weapons. They must testify to the War Commission.

##interview with Samvel Babayan, the Nagorno-Karabakh opposition leader 

**REPORTER:** You arrived yesterday. How was the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh?

**BABAYAN:** The residents of the Martakert region went to Stepanakert, then Yerevan. I was in one of the cars in the column. Heavy traffic.

**REPORTER:** Everyone wants to know how you were able to cross the checkpoint without being arrested by Azeri agents. After all, you were an active member of the 1st Karabakh War.

**BABAYAN:** When I entered Nagorno-Karabakh 7 months ago, Lachin was already blocked at the time. Everyone also wondered how I was able to get in. At the time I said that I could enter or leave Nagorno-Karabakh whenever I wanted.

Nothing extraordinary happened. I got out of the car like everyone else, greeted the Azeri checkpoint agent, walked 15 meters, greeted another cop, got in the car and proceeded to Armenia. 

It doesn't matter why I was confident I wouldn't get arrested. There are self-proclaimed heroes now in Nagorno-Karabakh hiding under their beds. Why? 

**REPORTER:** You have caused far more damage to Azerbaijan during the 1st war than many others who are on the wanted list. Why did they greet you and let you proceed?

**BABAYAN:** First of all, the agents are 30-year-old kids who could not have recognized me. Nobody checks passports. They check the vehicle trunk while you walk 15 meters before getting back into your car. 

Now everyone wonders why I'm not the last person leaving Nagorno-Karabakh. I said I would be the last person if they placed me in charge. They didn't. But when they behave like cattle and surrender the country... 

**REPORTER:** Please no insults.

**BABAYAN:** That's nothing. That's not enough for them. These people must answer for their actions. 

**REPORTER:** There was no agreement with Azerbaijan to let you through?

**BABAYAN:** No.

**REPORTER:** Other Nagorno-Karabakh officials complain about the inability to leave. They say even Russian peacekeepers can't help them.

**BABAYAN:** There are other methods for leaving. I can give them a hint.

**REPORTER:** You weren't concerned that the Azeri agent would identify and arrest you?

**BABAYAN:** No. I've already served in Azerbaijani prison. I can do it 5 more times as long as I know I pursue the right cause.

**REPORTER:** What happened in Nagorno-Karabakh? Let's start with the resignation of President Arayik Harutyunyan. 

**BABAYAN:** The 5th Department of Russian special services FSB had made a phone call to Arayik. This FSB department is tasked with overseeing the political affairs in the CIS. If you remember, shortly after the Ukraine war one of this department's ranking officials was placed under house arrest for failures. As a result of this department's incompetency, all 12 countries have downgraded or broken their relations with Russia over the past 20 years. 

The FSB called Arayik and told him that the FSB's other assets in Nagorno-Karabakh had reported that Arayik was cooperating with others [Arayik was reportedly personally open to the Western platform].

**REPORTER:** Who are the FSB's assets who reported Arayik to FSB?

**BABAYAN:** The former presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh. They told FSB they would be more loyal to them, so FSB organized the replacement of Arayik.

**REPORTER:** So Russia organized this operation.

**BABAYAN:** Yes. They also dispatched Ruben Vardanyan to Nagorno-Karabakh last year. Russia has just requested Vardanyan to be allowed to leave Nagorno-Karabakh. How come Russia is doing this? Didn't Vardanyan claim he wasn't a Russian agent when he first arrived? 

**REPORTER:** Tell us more about how they decided to remove Arayik.

**BABAYAN:** Arayik was one of them. They are the same team. He joined 3 former leaders and decided that it was best to appoint someone else. They invited me to Parliament at night to inform me that Azerbaijan had warned that they would attack had Stepanakert proceeded with the appointment of a new president.

**REPORTER:** So Azerbaijan gave a direct warning?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. But they said they planned on proceeding with the change anyway, and that they would carry the responsibility. So I asked them why they invited me at all if every political party except for ours had already decided the change would take place. They said they wanted me to promise there wouldn't be mass protests on the streets. 

Now our people are refugees. It's over. Is this team going to answer for their actions or not? Bako Sahakyan, Arkadiy Ghukasyan, Arayik Harutyunyan, Samvel Shahramanyan, and their MPs who voted in favor of the process must answer in the court.

Second. After one day of fighting, they released a statement urging Armenia to remove its army from Nagorno-Karabakh. But Armenia has no army there. What army is Armenia supposed to withdraw? 

**REPORTER:** Who wrote that text implicating Armenia?

**BABAYAN:** Russia. These idiots decided to cooperate. They also surrendered 100 tanks, 170 howitzers, multiple GRADs, TORs, and enough armament for an army. They gave it all to Azerbaijan without any damage. How is this not a crime? 

Now they criticize me for leaving Nagorno-Karabakh, for not standing next to them to carry responsibility for their criminal decisions. These criminals must be charged with crimes as soon as they step foot into Armenia.

We [Babayan's team] agreed with Azerbaijan that Nagorno-Karabakh would receive the status of an autonomous republic. There are 23 paragraphs written point-by-point. Azerbaijan agreed to that. People who passed this document back and forth through the NK-AZ border should come and testify about our negotiations with Azerbaijan. 

**REPORTER:** So there was an alternative? We could have avoided this war?

**BABAYAN:** Absolutely. We were given an opportunity to form an autonomous republic on the 4,400 km^2 areas of former NKAO. We could have our own national guard. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan gave its approval?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. 

**REPORTER:** Were you the negotiator?

**BABAYAN:** Through someone else. I sent my responses in written form. They agreed. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan agreed for Nagorno-Karabakh to have autonomy, local governing bodies, and a national guard?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. All of it. The regime committed a crime by rejecting. 

**REPORTER:** Did you inform the regime?

**BABAYAN:** They didn't even want to listen. They didn't even invite me for any meeting. They never invited me to any defense meetings during the last 15 days. They didn't like me because I was against changing the government. Good job! Now you are criminals who stole Nagorno-Karabakh's independence by scratching the election results. Today you are evacuating the population.

Armenia was spending $500M/year to help the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh live and prosper. Armenia gave everything. The regime in the end called Armenia a criminal with an army located inside Nagorno-Karabakh. Moreover, most of the heavy equipment they surrendered to Azerbaijan wasn't donated by Armenia. It's the weapons we captured from Azerbaijan during the 1st war. 

**REPORTER:** Under *your* agreement with Azerbaijan, what would be the fate of this equipment?

**BABAYAN:** To move them to Armenia but this was a paragraph that Azerbaijan disagreed with. They wanted us to destroy the equipment in place instead of sending it to Armenia. Out of 23 paragraphs, there were disagreements around only 3. This was one of them.

**REPORTER:** Why wasn't the regime open to your negotiation efforts?

**BABAYAN:** They adopted a maximalist stance. They wanted nothing less than full independence. They wanted to be treated as an ""equal party"". They ignored my calls to hold direct negotiations with Azerbaijan, while the opposition parties in Armenia called me a ""traitor"". 

The parties run by Kocharyan and Serj, and the regime in Nagorno-Karabakh were against doing trade with Azerbaijan through the Agdam route. Did the road open in the end or not? Did they surrender the country in the end or not?

Before they replaced Arayik, during a parliamentary session I informed them that my team was negotiating with Azerbaijan. Two days later these monkeys launched a defamation campaign saying *""None of it is realistic, Babayan is a liar""*. These are Russian spies and desantniks [Ruben Vardanyan].

They knew about the ongoing efforts but they were agents serving another state. You call them a [Russian] agent and they don't even deny being one. 

For 20 years they used the people to enrich themselves. Today the government of Armenia has an obligation to confiscate every property owned by them and distribute them to the refugees. Confiscate absolutely everything and resettle the refugees into their properties.

**REPORTER:** If the Russian FSB installed the new regime in Nagorno-Karabakh, why did they allow Azerbaijan to attack Nagorno-Karabakh? 

**BABAYAN:** What makes you believe Russia was capable of stopping the attack? Everything Azerbaijan has done against us in Nagorno-Karabakh was aimed at pushing Russia out of Nagorno-Karabakh. Everything was done to discredit Russia and to show that Russia was powerless. This is why I was insisting on DIRECT negotiations with Azerbaijan, without Russian mediation. 

It was a massive mistake not to accept the status of an autonomous republic. This would have been an opportunity for AM-AZ normalization and trade resumption. But these ջահելs wanted to *""fight until the end""*.

**REPORTER:** What was Ruben Vardanyan's role? 

**BABAYAN:** The blockade of Lachin began after the landing of Ruben Vardanyan in Nagorno-Karabakh. This answers your question on why Russia couldn't prevent the September 19 attack. Azerbaijan interpreted Vardanyan's landing as an attempt by Russia to freeze the conflict, which Azerbaijan would never agree to under any conditions. They also viewed the coup as an attempt by Russia to freeze the conflict.

**REPORTER:** Why did Russia want to freeze the conflict?

**BABAYAN:** To maintain influence in the region, over Armenia and Azerbaijan. The new regime didn't believe Azerbaijan would launch a massive attack. Many in Armenia also didn't. They all believed the Russian peacekeepers wouldn't allow that. They ignored my pleas and warnings that Azerbaijan was preparing to attack. They bribed and brainwashed the population with the help of their owners in Yerevan. Serj Sargsyan was the first person to publicly congratulate the new president of Nagorno-Karabakh. Will Serj agree to share the responsibility for this surrender? These people are Russian spies working for FSB's 5th department. They have different interests. 

**REPORTER:** What does the opposition want in Armenia?

**BABAYAN:** They will try to use the refugees to remove Pashinyan. I'd like to ask refugees not to serve any political force. We must focus on finding housing and jobs for them.

**REPORTER:** Is Russia actively helping the opposition to remove Pashinyan?

**BABAYAN:** I don't know, ask them. Many of them don't even realize they are being used by FSB. They are asked to do certain things by agents who report to FSB. We must provide assistance to refugees so they will feel secure and less likely to become a political tool in the hands of the opposition or the government.

**REPORTER:** If Azerbaijan wants to discredit Russia by attacking Armenians to show Russia is useless, how come Russia isn't taking any action against Azerbaijan?

**BABAYAN:** Russia has always tried to avoid a confrontation with Azerbaijan, from day one. Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey. 

**REPORTER:** Why did this all happen?

**BABAYAN:** Greed. It's all over. The government is burning all the documents in Stepanakert. It's very convenient. They don't have to explain how they spent $1B in Himnadram donations. No one can audit anymore. 

**REPORTER:** There are no archives?

**BABAYAN:** They are burning everything. Everyone in Stepanakert already knows that the fire won't stop for 5 days. They've been burning documents since last week. 

**REPORTER:** They are burning it so Azerbaijan won't take possession of them.

**BABAYAN:** That's a good excuse. They are getting rid of records of financial loans taken from the Himnadram fund. It's understandable they'd want to purge military or other sensitive records but what does Himnadram have to do with it? Anyways. There must be an investigation launched by Armenian authorities. //

##residents of Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert are forced to collect water with buckets: PHOTOS

Azerbaijan has shut down the delivery of electricity and gas to Nagorno-Karabakh, in addition to food supplies, making it impossible for some critical utility companies to function. Giant water buckets were installed in several districts of the capital. The garbage collection was suspended earlier this month.

##interview with international analyst Richard Giragosian

**REPORTER:** Why is the U.S. delaying the approval of military aid to Azerbaijan?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** I was part of the team working on the law to ban military aid to Azerbaijan in the 1990s. It was drafted in response to Azerbaijan's aggression and the blockade of Armenia. Today we're witnessing another aggression, and this time the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The ban was later weakened, allowing the U.S. presidents to bypass it. This year, however, the U.S. president isn't eager to bypass the ban. It's usually approved in June. Now it's August. There are three possible factors:

(1) The U.S. doesn't have a lot of leverage over Azerbaijan. The suspension of military aid is a rare example. 

(2) Azerbaijan is no longer as important for the U.S. military after its withdrawal from Afghanistan. This also deprives Azerbaijan of Pentagon's support in Washington. 

(3) The most interesting factor. The U.S. is disappointed at Azerbaijan over the lack of diplomatic progress during the latest negotiations between AM-AZ foreign ministers in Washington. The U.S. was expecting more from Azerbaijan. 

These aren't enough to sway Azerbaijan, however. 

**REPORTER:** Almost all UN Security Council states have acknowledged the humanitarian crisis caused by the blockade of the Lachin corridor. Calls were made for Azerbaijan or both sides to ensure free movement in and out of the region. Critics say the Western calls are pointless because they are being ignored by Azerbaijan. What was the benefit of the UNSC session?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** The UNSC session was very important, but not for the reasons you may think. This was a move by Armenia to initiate the gradual diplomatic isolation of Azerbaijan. This changes the dynamic. For the first time, Azerbaijan has found itself defending against Armenia's diplomatic initiative. This is very important, but still insufficient, so I have two suggestions for the Armenian government:

(1) The threat of withdrawing from the peace negotiations could be very effective for Armenia. The negotiations are set to resume in September. Perhaps Armenia could withdraw from it unless Azerbaijan lifts the blockade.

(2) Study the U.S. history during the Cold War. The U.S. faced an 11-month-long blockade of Berlin. In the end, the West opened an air corridor. This is an important precedence.

**REPORTER:** During the UNSC session, Russia defended the position of Turkey and Azerbaijan. The statements made by these three countries were quite similar. It is obvious now that Russia has sold out its former ally Armenia. On the other hand, we saw the emergence of new diplomatic allies in the West.

**GIRAGOSIAN:** There are some disagreements within the RU-TR-AZ alliance. The RU-TR ties have weakened since the re-election of Erdogan. Azerbaijan has chosen a very risky path by publicly humiliating Russia. Kremlin has a long memory and won't forget or forgive this. Today, Russia's primary goal is to save its face. Russia supports the Aghdam road because they have been humiliated and incapable of enforcing the Nov. 9 agreement. Russia, Turkey, and Azerbaijan act from positions of insecurity, not confidence. At the same time, Armenia is building bridges to India and China. Also, Armenia has successfully avoided becoming an area of confrontation between the West and Russia.

**REPORTER:** Describe the AM-US relations. Is it getting stronger?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** What we are seeing is a change in policy by the U.S., not Armenia. The Biden administration wants to strengthen Armenia and the strategic role of democratic Armenia. The U.S. is no longer trying to *promote* democracy, it is trying to *defend* democracy. The U.S. ambassador has once again visited Syunik and Vayots Dzor and made a statement. But it would be a mistake for Armenia to overestimate the importance of the U.S. The EU likely plays a more important role here.

**REPORTER:** Will there be another major war soon?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Today we have a Game of Thrones-esque medieval siege of Nagorno-Karabakh. There is a manmade crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh caused by Azerbaijan, targeting the peaceful population. This is about the peace negotiations between AM-AZ. The most concerning part is not the peace agreement or the negotiation process, but the enforcement of the peace agreement. Are there guarantees that Azerbaijan won't break the agreement? Because it is beneficial for the Aliyev regime to continuously have an external enemy.

**REPORTER:** Is Armenia doing enough to strengthen its army by acquiring modern weapons and drones?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Not enough. Armenia is still too weak to match the Turkey-backed Azerbaijan. Armenia should prioritize quality over quantity, professionalism and modernization over the acquisition of the cheapest weapons from unreliable Russia. The Armenian government's decision to sign a large arms deal with India was great news.

What concerns me is the murder incidents within the army and the poor quality of relations between the soldiers. This problem, inherited from the previous governments, is still present. There is a lack of discipline in the army. A generational investment is necessary to improve military education and preparedness. 

The future is on Armenia's side, not Azerbaijan's. But real results will require several years of hard work.

**REPORTER:** In response to your statement that the Aliyev regime will always need an external enemy. The political situation in Azerbaijan is not improving, and human rights are being viciously violated. This has led to the emergence of more and more Azeri activists who aren't afraid of speaking up. Some are even critical of Aliyev's militaristic policies and lack of true desire to establish peace with Armenia. Could this lead to a change in Azerbaijan's foreign policy?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Changes within Azerbaijan are inevitable, but most of them could be negative for Armenia. We see that Azerbaijan is not satisfied with its 2020 victory. It was dangerously unsatisfactory for them. 

As for the Aliyev regime, Aliyev has adopted a nationalist stance and lies between the competing pro-Russian and pro-Turkish factions. For now, this is being successfully used as a distraction from the government's corruption and the lack of democracy, but this cannot last forever. 

We witnessed the beginning of the tipping point a few weeks ago, with the arrests of several pro-Aliyev figures, civil society activists, former peace activists, and former moderates. Aliyev's regime is now turning against its own people even in the conditions of the confidence brought by the victory.

Azerbaijan could plunge into a period of internal unrest and weakness. There is a 1990s precedence. There is the presence of a Turkey-backed defense minister with dangerous ambitions.

Azerbaijan will implode. It is a matter of ""when"". Armenia, the West, and Russia must analyze the consequences of the inevitable instability in Azerbaijan.

**REPORTER:** Armenia is attempting to normalize relations with Turkey but the latter refuses, and demands the normalization of AM-AZ relations as a precondition. What are the prospects?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Turkey has made it clear that it cannot make any move that would harm its relations with Azerbaijan. But Turkey is very dissatisfied with its own weakness towards dominant Azerbaijan. Today, Azerbaijan is the #1 foreign direct investor in Turkey. Azerbaijan has leverage during the economic hardship in Turkey.

Turkey is concerned over the possibility of an AZ-RU conflict in the region. 

Armenia has become more important for Turkey after the latest elections in Turkey, because Russia has essentially excluded Turkey from trade and transport restoration projects. Regulating relations with Armenia is the only way for Turkey to restore its regional role in the economy and trade.

Turkey is not as strong as before. The developments with Greece and Cyprus indicate that this is the era of Turkey's aging, weaker leadership. Turkey is more vulnerable today. Turkey's military aid to Azerbaijan is also not at the same level as before, and Aliyev turns to his friend Netanyahu more often these days. There is more friction that's below the surface.

##artificial snow will be used for Armenia's new ski resort 

[Last year we learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/tgibhu/mar172022_new_armenian_ski_resort_to_compete_with/) about plans to build a new ski/leisure resort in Armenia that will compete against Georgian and Russian counterparts.

According to Economy Minister Kerobyan, 28 km of ski tracks have already been laid. The second branch of the gondola elevator is under construction. The artificial snow-making system, the first in Armenia, is being installed and will be operational this year. ""The project will change the quality of life in nearby villages.""

The MYLER company will invest $78m in the first stage. Hotels, golf courses, a casino, restaurants, and other infrastructure will be built later.

The resort aims to attract 500,000 tourists from Russia, Iran, and Europe.

##residents of Nagorno-Karabakh capital Stepanakert are forced to collect water with buckets: PHOTOS

Azerbaijan has shut down the delivery of electricity and gas to Nagorno-Karabakh, in addition to food supplies, making it impossible for some critical utility companies to function. Giant water buckets were installed in several districts of the capital. The garbage collection was suspended earlier this month.

##interview with international analyst Richard Giragosian

**REPORTER:** Why is the U.S. delaying the approval of military aid to Azerbaijan?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** I was part of the team working on the law to ban military aid to Azerbaijan in the 1990s. It was drafted in response to Azerbaijan's aggression and the blockade of Armenia. Today we're witnessing another aggression, and this time the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The ban was later weakened, allowing the U.S. presidents to bypass it. This year, however, the U.S. president isn't eager to bypass the ban. It's usually approved in June. Now it's August. There are three possible factors:

(1) The U.S. doesn't have a lot of leverage over Azerbaijan. The suspension of military aid is a rare example. 

(2) Azerbaijan is no longer as important for the U.S. military after its withdrawal from Afghanistan. This also deprives Azerbaijan of Pentagon's support in Washington. 

(3) The most interesting factor. The U.S. is disappointed at Azerbaijan over the lack of diplomatic progress during the latest negotiations between AM-AZ foreign ministers in Washington. The U.S. was expecting more from Azerbaijan. 

These aren't enough to sway Azerbaijan, however. 

**REPORTER:** Almost all UN Security Council states have acknowledged the humanitarian crisis caused by the blockade of the Lachin corridor. Calls were made for Azerbaijan or both sides to ensure free movement in and out of the region. Critics say the Western calls are pointless because they are being ignored by Azerbaijan. What was the benefit of the UNSC session?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** The UNSC session was very important, but not for the reasons you may think. This was a move by Armenia to initiate the gradual diplomatic isolation of Azerbaijan. This changes the dynamic. For the first time, Azerbaijan has found itself defending against Armenia's diplomatic initiative. This is very important, but still insufficient, so I have two suggestions for the Armenian government:

(1) The threat of withdrawing from the peace negotiations could be very effective for Armenia. The negotiations are set to resume in September. Perhaps Armenia could withdraw from it unless Azerbaijan lifts the blockade.

(2) Study the U.S. history during the Cold War. The U.S. faced an 11-month-long blockade of Berlin. In the end, the West opened an air corridor. This is an important precedence.

**REPORTER:** During the UNSC session, Russia defended the position of Turkey and Azerbaijan. The statements made by these three countries were quite similar. It is obvious now that Russia has sold out its former ally Armenia. On the other hand, we saw the emergence of new diplomatic allies in the West.

**GIRAGOSIAN:** There are some disagreements within the RU-TR-AZ alliance. The RU-TR ties have weakened since the re-election of Erdogan. Azerbaijan has chosen a very risky path by publicly humiliating Russia. Kremlin has a long memory and won't forget or forgive this. Today, Russia's primary goal is to save its face. Russia supports the Aghdam road because they have been humiliated and incapable of enforcing the Nov. 9 agreement. Russia, Turkey, and Azerbaijan act from positions of insecurity, not confidence. At the same time, Armenia is building bridges to India and China. Also, Armenia has successfully avoided becoming an area of confrontation between the West and Russia.

**REPORTER:** Describe the AM-US relations. Is it getting stronger?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** What we are seeing is a change in policy by the U.S., not Armenia. The Biden administration wants to strengthen Armenia and the strategic role of democratic Armenia. The U.S. is no longer trying to *promote* democracy, it is trying to *defend* democracy. The U.S. ambassador has once again visited Syunik and Vayots Dzor and made a statement. But it would be a mistake for Armenia to overestimate the importance of the U.S. The EU likely plays a more important role here.

**REPORTER:** Will there be another major war soon?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Today we have a Game of Thrones-esque medieval siege of Nagorno-Karabakh. There is a manmade crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh caused by Azerbaijan, targeting the peaceful population. This is about the peace negotiations between AM-AZ. The most concerning part is not the peace agreement or the negotiation process, but the enforcement of the peace agreement. Are there guarantees that Azerbaijan won't break the agreement? Because it is beneficial for the Aliyev regime to continuously have an external enemy.

**REPORTER:** Is Armenia doing enough to strengthen its army by acquiring modern weapons and drones?

**GIRAGOSIAN:** Not enough. Armenia is still too weak to match the Turkey-backed Azerbaijan. Armenia should prioritize quality over quantity, professionalism and modernization over the acquisition of the cheapest weapons from unreliable Russia. The Armenian government's decision to sign a large arms deal with India was great news.

What concerns me is the murder incidents within the army and the poor quality of relations between the soldiers. This problem, inherited from the previous governments, is still present. There is a lack of discipline in the army. A generational investment is necessary to improve military education and preparedness. 

The future is on Armenia's side, not Azerbaijan's. But real results will require several years of hard work.

**REPORTER:** In response to your statement that the Aliyev regime will always need an external enemy. The political situation in Azerbaijan is not improving, and human rights are being viciously violated. This has led to the emergence of more and more Azeri activists who aren't afraid of speaking up.

My reason is that our government which is a dictator government, hasn’t changed which means there is no progressive policies to make a change. Secondly, some people don’t look at both sides of facts before having an opinion.

Edit:
Thank you for the responses, everyone’s opinion is valid. It’s also important that we move away from our emotions and look at the reality of what’s happening. Genocides is a sensitive topic, we are sensitive about it and we usually bring up that issue in the conflict. It has already happened in both sides like in Sumgait pogrom and Khojaly, we must move on and avoid these atrocities. History can not repeat itself. I’ve also realized the importance of where the information you get and remember looking at tv channels owned by the government? They are mostly used for propaganda and whatever caused the issue and humanitarian crisis in NK right now is also by the environmental protestors. 

I actually know someone to some degree who went there and protested so I’m going to try and find out how and why he decided to go. I tried my best finding the cause of it but it’s hard to find the evidence. I can give updates in the thread for which I may create a new one.

Babayan has been in favor of holding direct talks with Azerbaijan without a third party, whereas the government of Nagorno-Karabakh wants an international party to be present. Azerbaijan recently refused to hold a dialogue with Nagorno-Karabakh under an international format.

**REPORTER:** Describe the current mood in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**BABAYAN:** The population has become disheartened by the government's inaction over the past two months [since the launch of the total blockade by Azerbaijan]. Now there is an agreement between several parties to exit their basements and ""unite"".

**REPORTER:** The representative of [smallest opposition party] ARF was elected as the leader of Parliament [with the help of President Arayik Harutyunyan's ruling party]. The ruling party continues to ignore your party, despite it being the largest opposition party. Why?

**BABAYAN:** These political parties drove Nagorno-Karabakh to its current state with their actions over the past 20 years. It's the same individuals today, except for one or two. They are terrified of the thought that our party can come to power. 

These 4 parties have now united. So far we are patiently waiting. At the end of the day, the public must realize that their indifference is what allows the government to get away with inaction.

These forces are controlled from elsewhere: their clans in Armenia, foreign countries, etc. They are doomed to fail, however. The more games they play, the worse it will get.

**REPORTER:** Are they afraid of vendetta and losing more than their wealth if you come to power? 

**BABAYAN:** That's what their propaganda says but I have no desire to imprison anyone.
The truth is, they understand that very soon nothing will depend on them anymore, they will be forced to surrender power. They must understand that it is a big crime not to take steps to resolve the ongoing crisis. Imprisonment in the future could be warranted in the event of inaction today. 

**REPORTER:** What can the government do? They have agreed to meet in a 3rd country but the proposal was rejected by Azerbaijan. You also support holding a dialogue with Azerbaijan. What's the difference between the proposals made by you and the government?

**BABAYAN:** First of all, the government is still saying ""We must fight"". To fight, they have to contact international institutions and courts to initiate certain procedures, which they aren't doing. They are incapable of ""fighting"".

If you aren't going to ""fight"", then why don't you sit down and talk with Azerbaijan? They say a 3rd party must be present. But Azerbaijan disagrees. So there are two options: 1) Hold a dialogue with Azerbaijan without a mediator. 2) Tell the public that ""we are going to fight"" and ""those of you who aren't ready to fight should leave the country now"".   

I support the former. We must prepare a package of humanitarian topics and send it to Azerbaijan. If the latter agrees, we can meet and discuss confidence-building measures. A year or two later we can discuss political issues.

**REPORTER:** So you support direct talks without a 3rd party?

**BABAYAN:** Of course. We have enough problems as is, we don't need a 3rd party to enter and try to solve its own issues through this process.

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh government says without a 3rd party presence Azerbaijan will attempt to subjugate Nagorno-Karabakh.

**BABAYAN:** That's the mentality of a weak politician who isn't confident in his negotiation skills. If you know what you're doing, you won't allow Azerbaijan to subjugate you through that dialogue. Prepare the papers. Send them to Baku. If the dialogue fails, *only then* you can claim that the only outcome of that dialogue is becoming an ethnic minority within Azerbaijan. 

**REPORTER:** Azeris hate you for your military background. What makes you think they will agree to talk to you?

**BABAYAN:** Nobody said I should be the negotiator. I said prepare the documents now. You can send Poghos or Petros to negotiate it. Also send a team of experts to discuss the economy, transportation, etc. 

**REPORTER:** Describe the content of the proposal you want to send to Azerbaijan.

**BABAYAN:** For example, recording our existence as a separate unit/entity. We must understand what Azerbaijan's true intentions are. Don't get ahead of yourself, go talk to them first. If Azerbaijan displays nonconstructive behavior, at least you'll have peace of mind that you tried to resolve it diplomatically.

**REPORTER:** And if Azerbaijan rejects? 

**BABAYAN:** We physically defend ourselves to make them understand that diplomacy is the best option.

**REPORTER:** What's the likelihood of a major NK-AZ war at this stage? 

**BABAYAN:** Unlikely. Both sides would sustain heavy losses. I don't recommend that.

**REPORTER:** Azeris would sustain heavy losses?

**BABAYAN:** Undoubtedly. These aren't your southern flatlands anymore. These are mountains and forests. It will be very cruel. Not recommended.

**REPORTER:** In your last interview you stated that the government of Nagorno-Karabakh had secretly negotiated with Azerbaijan the removal of dozens of military equipment from Nagorno-Karabakh. But this claim was denied by them.

**BABAYAN:** They didn't deny that. One person denied that he was the one who prepared the list of military equipment. He said it was drafted by the defense ministry. I have that list in my hand. It can be published if necessary. They removed lots of equipment and transported it to Armenia. Another 56 units were supposed to be removed but weren't.

You know what's funny? Immediately after the war, our government imported all sorts of goods - including food and construction materials - through the Aghdam road with the help of Russians, held talks with Azerbaijan, discussed the use of the Sarsang reservoir, etc. 

Somehow, today it's ""treason"" when I urge them to hold dialogue with Azerbaijan. ""Babayan wants us to integrate into Azerbaijan."" Listen, my lovely dummies, it's the same thing you've been doing over the past 3 years. What are you talking about now? Why are you screaming like a virgin? 

They are funny people. Is it news to them that they've been importing goods from Aghdam and negotiating over Sarsang? Babayan wasn't there when they were doing that...

**REPORTER:** It seems you are being criticized regardless of what you propose. When you propose taking steps to ""fight"" [in international institutions], they accuse you of attempting to deteriorate the situation and launch another armed conflict. When you propose holding a dialogue instead, they accuse you of attempting to integrate Nagorno-Karabakh into Azerbaijan. Why?

**BABAYAN:** It's a sickness. The people in power don't want to assume any responsibility. They are going to drive us off the cliff within the next 2 months. They will surrender our country to Azerbaijan just like we did Kars, then claim ""we had no other option"". They will soon be forced to tell the population to leave the country, but they won't admit it was their fault. 

**REPORTER:** Do you have regular conversations with President Arayik?

**BABAYAN:** Yes, under the President-Opposition Party format. But starting today, with the appointment of the ARF MP as the Parliament leader, I will only hold face-to-face meetings with him. No more ""political consultations"". It is pointless to work with parliamentary parties anymore because them getting together and making this appointment indicates that from now on, everything they bring to Parliament is a waste of time to discuss because it has already been ""decided"" elsewhere [referring to the Republic of Armenia opposition controlling the Nagorno-Karabakh opposition and directing their moves remotely]. I wish them good luck. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan proposes the use of the Aghdam road and uses that for its propaganda. Should we discuss or accept its use?

**BABAYAN:** Our proposal includes the use of Lachin and [Aghdam] roads for economic activities. We propose the creation of a Sadakhlo-esque market in Nagorno-Karabakh that will have goods imported from Armenia and Azerbaijan. The consumers will choose which country's product they want to buy.

**REPORTER:** We used to have a similar market on the Armenia-Azerbaijan-Georgia border. Everyone would bring their goods to the common market. Is that the model you envision?

**BABAYAN:** Today, no resident of Nagorno-Karabakh can safely cross the border, go to Azerbaijan's Aghdam, and buy products from there. Therefore, we must create a market right on the Askeran-Aghdam border. They can have a dispatcher with the list of Azeri companies that can supply goods. The goods can be stored and processed by a lab for quality and safety checks. A small business owner then purchases products from this market for resale. If you're a super-patriot, don't act like a clown now, just buy the Armenian product, no one will force you to buy the Azeri. 

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan wants to hold a dialogue in Yevlakh or Baku [both in Azerbaijan]. Would you accept that?  

**BABAYAN:** I don't care about the location of the meeting. First, we must draft a document and send it to Azerbaijan so we'll know what types of topics will be discussed so we'll know whom to send. 

If the spineless government is unwilling to execute this plan, it must resign and stop torturing the population.

**REPORTER:** What are your expectations from the government of Armenia?

##Nagorno-Karabakh President Arayik Harutyunyan's emergency message: 

As we speak, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh are being subjected to genocide. They are on the brink of destruction and losing their homeland. 

The only road that connects Nagorno-Karabakh to the external world, the road that travels through the Lachin Corridor and connects to Armenia, has been blocked by Azerbaijan since December 2022. 

The closure began as a fake environmental protest. It turned into an official policy by the state of Azerbaijan in April 2023 when they installed an illegal checkpoint. 

On 15 June they completely shut it down, launching a total siege against Nagorno-Karabakh and its 120,000 residents. 

For 8 months the population hasn't been able to move freely, and for 2 months the Red Cross and peacekeepers haven't been able to import food and other necessities. 

Azerbaijan's actions are against international law, the legally binding World Court ruling, the November 9 statement, and the European human rights court.

Azerbaijan's goal is to systemically exterminate the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. It is the continuation of their 2020 military aggression during which they received assistance from Turkey and terrorist cells from the Middle East.

Azerbaijan wants to use force to deprive the people of Nagorno-Karabakh of their right to self-determination. The most important guarantee for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to preserve its identity, rights, culture, and development is the recognition of it as a state, as an international legal subject.

Azerbaijan failed to physically remove every Armenian resident of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020, so they are pursuing the same goal through non-military means today. The illegal checkpoint on Lachin has already led to the arrest of our citizen Vagif Khachatryan, who was kidnapped by Azeri soldiers from the Red Cross convoy.

Now Azerbaijan is offering false choices, supposedly to ease the humanitarian crisis, which they are responsible for. They are trying to promote the narrative that Nagorno-Karabakh has to rely on foreign aid and that they are willing to ""aid"" Nagorno-Karabakh. In reality, they are starving Nagorno-Karabakh to forcefully subjugate it. Their offer to use the Aghdam road is part of their criminal plan.

Azerbaijani officials aren't even hiding that their goal is the expulsion of the indigenous Armenian population from their homeland. 

The Stepanakert-Baku dialogue proposed by Azerbaijan is, in reality, an attempt by Azerbaijan to legitimize its criminal policies. Any calls to hold a meeting with Azerbaijan without a mediator and guarantees is an encouragement to Azerbaijan's genocidal policies.

For the negotiations to be effective and legitimate, it is necessary to ensure that the sides follow international norms. Azerbaijan has been violating these norms with impunity. Nagorno-Karabakh, on the other hand, has been in favor of holding productive and fair negotiations.

We must first create favorable and equal conditions for negotiations to take place, then discuss the international mechanism that will have the mandate to mediate the negotiations. Without this, while having one side that wants to destroy the other at any cost, there can be no dialogue.

International institutions have demanded Azerbaijan to reopen the Lachin Corridor but no actions have been taken yet. Experts have also weighed in, and the first Prosecutor at ""International Criminal Court"" Luis Moreno-Ocampo has made a statement.

##... our message:

(1) Armenia should immediately ask the UN Security Council to discuss and adopt a resolution regarding the illegal closure of the Lachin Corridor and the genocidal siege.

(2) Use every available platform to raise awareness.

(3) Our international colleagues should sanction Azerbaijan.

(4) I urge the Armenian government and others to refrain from making statements that question Nagorno-Karabakh's right to self-determination.

(5) Diasporans should ask their governments and NGOs to pressure Azerbaijan. 

(6) Russian peacekeepers should multiply efforts to immediately end the blockade and follow the Nov. 9 statement.

(7) Russia, the U.S., and France being the OSCE trio and members of UNSC, should take immediate steps to force Azerbaijan to end the blockade, and to restore the international negotiation mechanism.

(8) UNSC members should discuss Azerbaijan's genocidal policies and adopt a resolution forcing them to end the blockade, as ruled by the UN World Court. Preventing genocide is the collective responsibility of the international community.

(9) UN General Secretary should use the system at its full to put an end to this crime. His secretaries should present the information they've received, containing facts about Azerbaijan's genocidal policies. Send a fact-finding mission to Nagorno-Karabakh.

(10) UN's human rights and refugee program leaders should provide an assessment of the ongoing crisis.

(11) Red Cross is the only international organization with a presence in Nagorno-Karabakh. I urge them to share the facts with international organizations and UNSC member states. 

(12) European Council should take steps to implement the ECHR's 21 Dec 2022 verdict. With so many violations of the fundamental pillars, they should consider Azerbaijan's expulsion from the Council.

(13) EU should use its resources and tools, including sanctions, to pressure Azerbaijan to end the mass violation of human rights. I urge the EU to stay true to its values. Refrain from placing Azerbaijan's oil above human rights.

(14) To other international actors: Join the awareness campaign and ask your governments to take steps to end the crisis.

(15) To the international press: Your mission to inform the world is an important one. Break the unacceptable silence. Provide the world with factual information about Azerbaijan's crimes.

(16) To the world: Nagorno-Karabakh is the *only* place in the world today that's under a total blockade, where the international community is fully barred from accessing. Don't you wonder why Azerbaijan is doing this against the peaceful population of Nagorno-Karabakh? 

Nagorno-Karabakh is not a ""grey zone"" anymore, it is a ""black hole"". Here you can witness every crime against humanity. This impunity to carry out genocide will give birth to more crimes, perhaps someday against your own people. I ask and demand everyone to act to prevent this ongoing genocide until it's completely too late.

##Armenia's new nuclear power plant || What are the problems with Russian and large-capacity reactors? || U.S. offers a low-interest loan for construction || Interview with the director of HayAtom 

**REPORTER:** Metsamor NPP expires in 2036. When should we expect the new reactor to be ready?

**PETROSYAN VAHRAM:** Metsamor expires in 2026. There is an ongoing process to extend it until 2036. This type of reactor could be further extended until 2041. The structural integrity of the metal body is what defines how long you can extend its lifespan. During the most recent [and first] attempt we were able to restore the metal's properties by 80%. Along with Dutch experts, we've concluded that we can extend it until 2041, and that's a conservative estimate. That's plenty of time to build a new reactor. I'm part of the team formed by PM Pashinyan [a year ago] to discuss the selection and construction process. 

South Korea and France have offered their options. We will send an envoy to South Korea soon.

Russia offers large 1,000-1,200 MW blocks. They also have small 600-800 MW units but they are Fast Neutron Reactors with liquid metal coolers(?). These aren't as appealing for Armenia.

**REPORTER:** Can we afford to hire Russians to build reactors like the ones they build in Turkey recently?

**PETROSYAN:** Those are expensive 1,200 reactors. Russia builds them with Russian money, sets the price of electricity, and sells the electricity. Would this work in Armenia? I'm not sure because we have to consider the socio-economic issues and the possible price of that electricity.

But let's say we build a 1,200 reactor. What are we going to do with the excess power? If we have a functional grid that can export large volumes of electricity to Iran and Georgia, then this wouldn't be a bad option. We are currently building new power lines to connect to our neighbors. 

Russia says they can lower the 1,200's power by 50% but I don't consider it a normal option. Besides that, the 1,200 units are more difficult to cool and require taller cooling towers which require additional solutions to be earthquake-proof.

The U.S. offers quite interesting options, ranging from small to large capacities. The State Department recently invited our working group to the U.S. We visited the [presumably Oak Ridge] nuclear research laboratory in Tennessee. It's a large center where Albert Einstein used to work. We were given a tour to learn about their nuclear fuel, technologies, etc. 

They offered us a 300 MW boiling water reactor called ""BWR"". The first unit is still under work, it hasn't been licensed yet. The first one will be built after the 2030s. They plan on building those in Eastern European countries like Poland.

The U.S. is also offering us a 77 MW reactor by NuScale. It's a modular reactor, each one is 77. Six of them combined would be slightly above Metsamor. This is a compact new technology that has just been licensed but not yet built for commercial use. They hope to launch the first one in the U.S. in 2025, followed by the second one in Romania.

**REPORTER:** Russia is offering a large capacity which would allow us to export more, while the U.S. reactor would allow Armenia to diversify its energy source, to reduce reliance on Russia. What is the priority?

**PETROSYAN:** Our Group does not discuss political issues. We want the most technologically sound option and the one that will produce electricity that's cheap for Armenia.

**REPORTER:** Do you already know whose option will offer the cheapest electricity?

**PETROSYAN:** Approximately. We don't want the price to exceed 6.3 cents per kWh.

**REPORTER:** Will you ensure that the price of the new electricity is equal to or lower than the current price?

**PETROSYAN:** It won't be lower because the price of metal components keeps increasing, although, on the other hand, the cost of nuclear fuel could decrease thanks to new technologies that are being developed in Russia and elsewhere.

**REPORTER:** What's your personal opinion?

**PETROSYAN:** The U.S. is offering an [AP300](https://info.westinghousenuclear.com/news/westinghouse-launches-ap300-smr) that is also a pressurized water reactor. It is the modernized and reduced version of the larger AP1000 unit. If we can build two AP300, that will give us 600 MW. 
Transporting and retraining experts would be a challenge. We would need to purchase the fuel from Westinghouse. It is possible to produce cheap electricity. 

AP300 is very close to our Metsamor reactor. It's a similar environment despite some differences like the number of steam generators. Russia's 1,200 reactor is also similar to ours - more modern and more powerful.

Russia has made a price proposal but we sent it back and asked them to review the calculations. The numbers are confidential. We will review all the available options. The Government has instructed us to wrap up the process and present our suggestion by the end of this year so they can make the final decision.

**REPORTER:** Who will finance the construction if it's a U.S. or a Russian reactor?

**PETROSYAN:** Russia is attempting to offer some credits, the plan is not clear yet. As for the U.S., they want to offer a loan with a near-0% interest rate just so they can enter our region and become a player. 

**REPORTER:** Which reactor would be best suited for our grid?

**PETROSYAN:** Two units of AP300 reactors offered by the U.S.

**REPORTER:** If we choose a large Russian reactor, can we find a buyer for our excess electricity? Azerbaijan and Turkey are large producers, and Georgia is also exporting.

**PETROSYAN:** We are currently building two transmission lines: 400 kW to Georgia and one to Iran. We can sell electricity to Russia or elsewhere via Georgia. We would need to clarify this and sign export contracts in advance to ensure we have an export destination. Iran is a serious option. 

**REPORTER:** What happens if the new one is built before the expiration of Metsamor?

**PETROSYAN:** Metsamor will be shut down and decommissioned. This will be an expensive process.

**REPORTER:** Will you royally fuck this up and leave the plan on the paper?

**PETROSYAN:** I don't think so. Once we decide whose technology we'll be using, the rest will be more straightforward. The U.S. State Department is very serious about their offer. They expect a similar attitude from us.

8/12/2023,"Nagorno-Karabakh oppo. leader Samvel Babayan: Russia's offer to launch Aghdam road in exchange for reopening Lachin was a faux deal. Superpowers must stop using us as puppets. || Peacekeepers using the blockade as a business opportunity. || Interviews with Babayan, Karen Sargsyan, ex-PM Aram","##Russian press: the parties were close to reaching an agreement to use the Aghdam road and reopen Lachin but the Nagorno-Karabakh government backed away amid Azerbaijan's refusal to make concessions 

**KOMMERSANT:** Russian government assesses the overall situation as very difficult. Azerbaijan isn't ready for concessions. All the efforts by the West and Russia have not given any results. The government of Nagorno-Karabakh is also persistent.

Russia offered a solution: launch the traffic via Aghdam with the help of the Red Cross, then reopen the Lachin Corridor 24 hours later. Initially, both sides expressed interest at a high level but Nagorno-Karabakh later demanded for the Lachin traffic to resume the same day, not later.

Nagorno-Karabakh later stated that the goods entering through the Aghdam road should not have Azerbaijani origin. Later [Azerbaijan kidnapped an ethnic Armenian hospital patient named Vagif Khachatryan who was traveling through the Lachin Corridor to Armenia]. No deal was reached. Russia believes the Aghdam road will eventually open. // end

Azerbaijan has confirmed that such offer existed but no deal was reached.

Nagorno-Karabakh demands the complete removal of the illegal Azerbaijani checkpoint on the Lachin Corridor, installed in violation of the Nov. 9 agreement. 

Kommersant's source did not clarify what ""reopening"" the Lachin Corridor would entail. Would Azerbaijan continue to illegally stop to search the passengers and traffic while claiming the corridor is technically ""open""? Would Azerbaijan illegally demand the transferred goods to be taxed while claiming the corridor is technically ""open""?

##Nagorno-Karabakh responds to Kommersant article:

The parties must follow the Nov. 9 agreement. Lachin must remain open. Tying Lachin to other roads unrelated to Nov. 9 agreement is unacceptable. Azerbaijan is using hunger as a weapon against the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

[source,](https://factor.am/676610.html)



##Nagorno-Karabakh opposition leader Samvel Babayan responds to Kommersant story: it was a faux deal by Russia trying to stay relevant in the region

**REPORTER:** Why did the deal fail?

**BABAYAN:** I was present during a meeting organized by the government to discuss that offer and I expressed my disapproval because the offer was superficial in nature. Russia is trying to show that it's still a regional player in response to the U.S.'s recent attempt to organize a meeting between the parties. We are a toy for superpowers, they are trying to promote their interests by using us.

From now on, I advise the superpowers to keep their little games to themselves. Both Armenians and Azeris have a tongue and know how to speak. We will meet face-to-face and discuss our issues. Thank you very much.

**REPORTER:** Kommersant writes that the parties had almost agreed but Nagorno-Karabakh was the one that rejected it at the last moment. 

**BABAYAN:** I don't know what the government told Russia behind closed doors but a meeting was organized between all political forces and the government to discuss the offer. Everyone was against it. 

These types of ""negotiations"" must stop now. We must have a clearly formulated document of topics that we want to discuss with Azerbaijan face-to-face before we send anyone.

Russia is done. They lost relevance the moment they surrendered the Lachin Corridor to Azerbaijan. They shouldn't make any noises now and try to exert their dominance anymore.

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh president Arayik believes that Azerbaijan blocked the Lachin Corridor because Armenia is resisting and refusing to grant a ""corridor"" to Azerbaijan via Syunik. Do you agree?

**BABAYAN:** No. Absolutely no. Azerbaijan has blocked Lachin to subjugate the population of Nagorno-Karabakh so they'll have no choice but to ""integrate"". It's our fault that we didn't demand sufficient guarantees for the Lachin Corridor from the beginning, that we voluntarily surrendered territories [located between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh] without receiving sufficient guarantees. 

What we need today is a document that'll be the basis for NK-AZ negotiations so we'll understand what each side really wants and what steps they are willing to take.

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh government helped elect an ARF MP as the president of parliament. Does this signal a shift in Nagorno-Karabakh's foreign policy?

**BABAYAN:** They think it'll help activate the diaspora but I disagree. If anything, it could strain the relations with Armenia, which we can't afford right now.

**REPORTER:** You wrote letters to Serj in 2013 and Pashinyan in 2018 describing the types and quantities of weapons we needed to purchase, and in the event they couldn't be purchased, you explained that serious diplomatic concessions needed to be made. 

Had they followed your advice then, do you believe we would have a different outcome in 2020, or do you believe Turkey-Azerbaijan-Russia were already determined to force Armenia to make painful concessions?

**BABAYAN:** We would have a different outcome. Azerbaijan wouldn't be able to launch a 2020-style war.

**REPORTER:** I've read your letters since 2013 and they predict the future correctly. Did Serj and Pashinyan ignore them because they *wanted* this outcome, or because they were shortsighted?

**BABAYAN:** When the War Commission was launched, I wanted them to investigate all the events dating back to 15 years. But they refused, so I refused to take part in the Commission. Going back 15 years would tell us if things were brought to this state knowingly and intentionally. We need to understand what the problem was with the acquisition of those weapons. If we had a personnel shortage, why didn't we take steps to ensure that, for example, 3 people are assigned to an artillery battery as opposed to 7? 

**REPORTER:** You believe we need to be pragmatic and agree to concessions now to avoid bloodshed and to keep Nagorno-Karabakh Armenian. Your critics consider this a defeatist stance. Why is there a propaganda machine working against you?

**BABAYAN:** Because I'm the only public figure in Nagorno-Karabakh who isn't working as a spy for another state. My proposal is actually a standard practice: Before you send someone for negotiations you need to have a comprehensive document that describes the topics you want to negotiate, and your goals. I've never proposed turning us into an ethnic minority within Azerbaijan. If you aren't going to help me with this process, at least don't get in my way. We have too many hobo analysts, who understand nothing about Nagorno-Karabakh, opposing these efforts. They will smarten up gradually. Let's give them another 15-25 days.

**REPORTER:** Are there any circles in Russia, or perhaps Russia itself, who are opposed to your activities in Nagorno-Karabakh? Is Russia afraid of being pushed out of the region if Nagorno-Karabakh chooses your route and starts resolving its problems with Azerbaijan without Russia's ""help""? 

**BABAYAN:** Let's not single out Russia here. If Nagorno-Karabakh exercises true independence and takes steps to resolve its own issues, no foreign state will like that because they prefer to have a puppet.

Kommersant wrote that Nagorno-Karabakh had initially agreed to the Aghdam deal but turned it down at the last moment. When Russia figures out how and why it was turned down, when they finally realize that we refuse to be puppets anymore, they will understand what's going on. 

**REPORTER:** What is Russia's solution to this conflict?

**BABAYAN:** Yesterday Russia copy-pasted a text from international laws regarding ethnic minorities, and presented it as a solution. Russia says the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, within Azerbaijan, will have their separate sports tournaments, preserve their language and schools, and all that stuff, lol. Even Azerbaijan hasn't dared to present anything like that.

Knowing that Nagorno-Karabakh will be against this idea, Russia will propose it anyway, expecting it to be rejected and the conflict to continue. This is how they control the region and promote their interests. The only losers are Armenians and Azeris.

**REPORTER:** The conflict was frozen after the 90's war. After the 2020 war, Vladimir Putin said the conflict should be frozen again and left for future generations. Is Russia trying to freeze the conflict so it can later unfreeze it at any time to resolve geopolitical issues? Also, what's your stance on the West's strategy?

**BABAYAN:** Any country has its interests and solutions. We have ours. We must sit down and discuss our issues directly with Azeris. Azerbaijan must realize that if the conflict is frozen again, two decades later we're going to have another bloody war and there is no guarantee they will win. 

**REPORTER:** What can/should the Republic of Armenia do?

**BABAYAN:** 1) To do what they are currently doing: work with international institutions, but with more vigor. 2) Send more economic aid.

##ex-PM Aram Sargsyan about the Nagorno-Karabakh war

...

**SARGSYAN:** Armenia's #1 issue today is the outdated army management and insufficient armament. Russia was supposed to arm us but didn't. At least the West has functional weapons. Russian weapons have been proven to be inferior while their military education is worthless. Armenian generals received their education in Russian academies with a bottle of cognac. Azeri generals were in the same spot.

On the 14th day of the war, Ilham Aliyev complained about the difficulties on the battlefield, suggesting that Armenians were too entrenched. That was the best moment to reach a peace agreement but Russia proposed an unfavorable plan and no agreement was reached. Turkey's CoGS sent its experts to Azerbaijan, sidelined Azeri CoGS, and took full control over the management and strategy with NATO standards. 

Armenia needs weapons from France, U.S., and the civilized world. Russia doesn't have what we need. *""The West is not providing any tangible support,""* critics say. Who do you think prevented Azerbaijan from invading Syunik to force a corridor in 2021-2022? Western diplomats stood in Syunik and then dispatched their border observers there. 

Russia and Azerbaijan still want that corridor but are silent because of the opposition from the collective West. Aliyev had to back away and announce that by ""corridor"" he doesn't mean a sovereign corridor, and that he similarly refers to China's trade route as a ""corridor"". The West helped prevent the formation of a ""corridor"" through Syunik. 

The Armenian government is still too cautious and afraid of adopting a closer stance toward the West. Sometimes you have to *do* it. Make the step, sign an agreement of strategic cooperation with the U.S. if you want more support, and not just military support.

The former U.S. ambassador revealed in 2021 that the U.S. is ready to invest $8 billion in the renewable energy sector with an emphasis on solar, primarily in the Syunik province of Armenia, on the hills near village Lichk [between Kajaran and Meghri]. 

At first, I thought it was purely a political program to ""save"" Syunik but the calculations of the sunny days in Armenia made it obvious there is a strong economic incentive as well. That area has many sunny days in a year. 

That statement by the ex-ambassador was made publicly. Has anyone ever reached out to him? I have, but I'm not the government. 

Have you ever heard of any Western leader stating that Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan? Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov, on the other hand, have stated exactly that. Lavrov said that Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh must become ethnic minorities within Azerbaijan, without any status or a line of contact.

We must respect Russia, but we must understand that they've become our enemy. Their interests align with Azerbaijan's. Don't expect any empathy from the Russian peacekeepers in Lachin. They aren't going to drive those parked humanitarian trucks to Nagorno-Karabakh.

The issue with Russia goes deeper. Their agents are everywhere in Armenia. Some of them see Armenia as a Tatarstan within Russia, others took funds from Gasprom to run for upcoming municipal elections in Armenia while promising to make water, electricity, and transportation free.

Right now Armenia should focus on getting a UNSC resolution on the unblocking of the Lachin Corridor. I'm confident we'll succeed. And if there is a veto, the Armenian public will see the face of our foe. End the practice of timidity. You don't need approval from Moscow before your every step.

##sociologist Karen Sargsyan about the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict

**SARGSYAN:** Aliyev is in a situation where he can only increase the bet. Unlike his fellow dictator Putin, he doesn't have the flexibility to slip up. It's further complicated by the appearance of new cards in the hands of Pashinyan: the World Court ruling and the analysis made by the former prosecutor of the International Criminal Court about the impending genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh.

That analysis was picked up by the international media. They are comparing Nagorno-Karabakh to Srebrenica and Khartoum, with the main point being the need to act immediately to prevent the repetition of previous genocides, so billions of dollars won't need to be spent later to address the outcome. 

German outlets, big and small, are criticizing PM Scholz for remaining silent.

Foreign Minister Mirzoyan has made 12 phone calls over the past 3 days, all addressed to Western and non-CSTO countries. He is on the right track. He always mentions that Azerbaijan's goal is genocide.

As I've said earlier, Aliyev has chosen the path of Vladimir Putin: raise the bet higher and higher. But if Putin can use the factor of internal consolidation and concentration of power to frequently screw up by getting semi-couped by Prigozhin and acting like nothing has happened, by losing several occupied regions of Ukraine and ignoring it, by threatening strikes and never following through with the promise, Aliyev can't afford the same weakness.

Aliyev doesn't have that luxury. All it took is one small village in Azerbaijan to complain about environmental issues for the entire country to react. There are ropes wrapped around Aliyev that can tighten at any moment.
The only thing Aliyev is successfully selling today is the limited quantities of fossil energy.

Azerbaijan is not in a position to ignore the Western demands today. Pashinyan needs to send humanitarian aid to Ukraine and declare that Armenia recognizes Ukraine's borders under the 1991 CIS agreement, just as we want Azerbaijan to recognize our 1991 borders. 

It doesn't matter anymore if it'll piss Russia off. They have already sold you to Turkey and Azerbaijan in exchange for Turkish sea routes and Azeri trade routes. 

Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh are playing backgammon with Azeri soldiers while the Armenian population serves. It's business for them. As of December data, during the blockade, peacekeepers would import food and sell it to the Armenian population for ֏10,000 a box or $10,000 per lorry.

Ilham Aliyev is a war criminal. Under international law, the death of those two children and the frequent fainting of pregnant women in Nagorno-Karabakh, caused by the blockade, is considered a war crime. We must emphasize the similarities between the actions of Russia and Azerbaijan.

**MOD:** The Azerbaijani army violated the ceasefire by using mortars and drones against Armenian positions starting at 7:50 a.m. on Friday. //

MOD released footage showing an accumulation of Azerbaijani equipment near the border: [video](https://twitter.com/azatutyunradio/status/1697556581477404927).

3 KIA and 2 WIA on the Armenian side.

The Armenian army used drones against Azeri troops. They had 3 WIA as of Friday morning, with another report stating 5 KIA by afternoon.

A [video was published](https://youtu.be/86hyA-xsp8w?t=13) reportedly showing an Armenian drone dropping a munition at Azeri soldiers, wounding 2 of them.

The [second video](https://youtu.be/6072nnRecJg?t=10) was published later showing an Azeri soldier being struck by a munition dropped from a drone.

The aforementioned Azeri soldiers were located within the sovereign territory of Armenia. They invaded these territories in 2022.

**Government:** All units of the armed forces of Azerbaijan must be withdrawn from the sovereign territory of Armenia. Azerbaijan must end the illegal blockade of the Lachin corridor and Nagorno-Karabakh.

**Ambassador-at-large Marukyan:** Azerbaijan's attack is a direct damage to the mediation efforts of the USA, France, and EU. It is a direct damage to the ongoing peace negotiation process and a violation of all of Azerbaijan's commitments to date. This aggression must be stopped immediately and the aggressor must be held responsible.


##... how did it start?

**REPORTER:** What can you tell us about the attack?

**ANDRANIK KOCHARYAN (defense official):** Azeri soldiers opened fire while our troops were organizing a routine rotation in their positions. What I can tell you is that our army is in better shape now, and Azeri ceasefire violations are no longer going unanswered. Our soldiers fired back. 

Azeri soldiers must understand that these ceasefire violations won't solve anything. They must exercise discipline and not open fire during our troop rotation process or whenever we do engineering work with heavy equipment. They will receive an answer if they do.

**REPORTER:** Did Azerbaijan use a mortar against one of our vehicles?

**ANDRANIK:** Yes. Our losses were caused by the shrapnel. It didn't go unanswered. This isn't 2021 when they could brazenly open fire thinking there wouldn't be consequences.

##... military expert Artsrun Hovhannisyan about the border attack & army reforms 

**REPORTER:** Is there an accumulation of forces by Azerbaijan?

**ARTSRUN:** Azerbaijan has brought artillery units closer to the border, as you saw in the video, but it's not in large quantities. 

**REPORTER:** We saw videos of Armenian drones dropping munitions on Azeri soldiers. It looked like Ukrainians using their now-famous quadcopters. Does this show progress?

**ARTSRUN:** This isn't the first time our army has used them, but it's the first time it was revealed in HD. These drones are great but to win modern wars you need bigger weapons. 

**REPORTER:** How much time does Armenia need to restore its military after the 2020 losses?

**ARTSRUN:** If we maintain the intensity of ongoing reforms, which we've witnessed especially over the past year, within the next 1-2 years we will have an army that's better and more modern than our 2020 army.
I don't like openly discussing our accomplishments and purchases from other countries. Keep quiet and work, keep quiet and buy, keep quiet and manufacture.

##EU proposes step-by-step approach to end the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh

**Charles Michel's plan:** The step-by-step approach would reflect a sequencing in the full-fledged operation of the Lachin corridor and the opening of the Agdam route. 

Sequencing of these steps and the type of cargo that would be delivered by each of these roads, as well as attendant procedures, have been the core of the recent discussions.

The EU strongly believes the Lachin corridor must be unblocked, in line with past agreements and the World Court Order. The use of the Agdam road to provide supplies can also be part of a sustainable solution to the provision of urgent and daily basic needs.

Exchanges have also focused on restoring electricity and gas supplies to Karabakh Armenians as soon as possible.

Dialogue between Baku and representatives of Armenians living in the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast will be essential in this regard. The rights and security of Karabakh Armenians must be guaranteed and discussions on specific modalities should start as soon as possible. //

##Azerbaijan responds to U.S.'s calls to open the Lachin corridor ""immediately""

The foreign ministry of Azerbaijan called Washington's statement ""unacceptable"" and claimed that the corridor isn't closed, despite the Azerbaijani president's [admission](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/164t5p0/aliyev_admits_he_has_blocked_lachin_azerbaijan/) that it is.

##U.S. Congress members draft a bill to end military aid to Azerbaijan 

4 amendments have been proposed to the Defense Appropriations Act (HR4365) to prohibit U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan and direct President Joe Biden to break the Lachin blockade.

What's in the amendments?

(1) Do not allocate the funds necessary for supplying arms to Azerbaijan.

(2) Do not send any military aid to Azerbaijan that could be used against Armenia or Nagorno-Karabakh.

(3) Do not allocate funds for the protection of Azerbaijani borders.

(4) DO allocate $1 million to relevant U.S. agencies to help end the Lachin blockade and deliver humanitarian aid to Nagorno-Karabakh.

##Armenian Government asks Parliament to officially ratify the Rome Statute despite warnings from Russia 

Russia had earlier warned Armenia about ""extremely negative consequences"" for bilateral relations if it's ratified. The Armenian Government gave reassurances that it was not aimed against Russia, and subsequently postponed the decision to ratify it, until now.  

>Armenia's ratification of the statute would theoretically obligate the country to arrest those for whom the [International Criminal Court] has issued arrest orders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, if they visit the country

>Therefore, ratification would be a significant sign of Armenia's efforts to reduce alignment with Russia

Armenian Government says the ratification's goal is to bring war crimes cases against the Azerbaijani military.

##interview between military expert Artsrun Hovhannisyan and analyst Karen Sargsyan: Ukraine war

**KAREN:** What's happening in Ukraine?

**ARTSRUN:** Critics have pointed to a lack of ""breakthrough"" to suggest Ukraine's assault has failed. But this isn't a classical assault. Instead of starting from the frontline and reaching the depths, Ukraine is doing it reversed. They started by destroying Russia's logistics routes, storage facilities, command centers, and bridges located in the rear. It's meant to isolate and weaken the Russian troops on the frontline.

As we speak, Ukrainian forces have broken through the first defense line in Robotine. There are reports that this settlement has been captured.

Now Ukraine will insert several Brigades along its mobile reserves that are equipped with Western armored vehicles. There will be fierce battles. If Ukraine breaks through the 3rd defense line, they will reach the Sea of Azov.

Ukraine's job will be very difficult. The last time this type of [multi-layered defense line named after Surovikin] was successfully breached was by the U.S. army in southern Iraq in 1991. 

USSR grossly exaggerated the Finnish defense line (Mannerheim Line) claiming it was all covered in concrete, etc. It's all a myth. Only ~60 of the 214 firing positions were concrete. The rest was mud, wood, and simple machine guns. In their attempt to breach this line, the USSR had to fire 46,000 units of 203mm artillery shells, carry out 80,000 flights, and utilize 2.5 armies (each 100,000).

Soviet Gen. Zhukov was tasked with breaching the Berlin defense. He had 11 armies, 2 aviation armies, and 2 tank armies. I want you to understand the density. The narrowest frontline that the USSR could breach was 27 km. For each 1 km, they brought 360 artillery pieces and dropped tons and tons of bombs on German heads.

Now back to the U.S. assault on Iraq in 1991. It lasted 42 days. During the first 38 days, U.S. aviation conducted 110,000 combat flights. This was followed by 2.5 hours of heavy artillery prep work with 90,000 shells, and only then they proceeded to roll the tanks.

Do you see the density of preparatory work in these examples? Ukraine has launched its offensive with insufficient assault power. No air superiority, which is mandatory for the attacker; not enough artillery density; not enough armored vehicles, they don't have a 3x advantage. 

This is why it may appear that Ukraine's strategic goal is unachievable. In my opinion, this operation, as of right now, is generally slow but sufficiently fast considering the aforementioned ratio of forces.

We've seen Ukraine successfully use small drones to fly long distances or use long-range missiles to target bridges. Imagine what they could do if they had the numbers. 

**KAREN:** Why did Russia withdraw troops from elsewhere and deploy them in the Kupiansk [north] direction?

**ARTSRUN:** Germans had realized that since they could face a numerically superior force, they couldn't keep very large reserves, so they'd need to maneuver with whatever reserves they had by deploying them in the right location at the right time. 

Today both sides are attempting that approach. Russia attacked Kupiansk to prevent Ukrainian reserves located in this direction from being used elsewhere to achieve a breakthrough. 

Ukraine, with the help of NATO's intel, is maneuvering its reserves better. They are focused on Robotine right now, but at any time they could quickly deploy these reserves elsewhere if necessary. They have this ability. They still have the German-made Marders, Swedish CV90s, and a bunch of other reserves.

Russia, after the unsuccessful assault on Kupiansk, is moving its forces to close the hole in Robotine.

**KAREN:** But they have to travel a long distance from Kupiansk to Robotine. There is no ""straight line"".

**ARTSRUN:** That makes their job even more difficult. Russia is losing this battle of reserve maneuverability. They also haven't announced the second mobilization yet. Now would be the time to conclude it, but they haven't even launched it yet. Last time when they delayed the first mobilization it cost them the Kharkiv region.

This is why, *at a minimum*, I won't rule out that this particular Ukrainian assault could succeed by November.

Let's forget about the F-16 jets for a second. If Ukraine could receive 200 pieces of ATACMS, the American equivalent of Iskander, it could change everything.

**KAREN:** Let's not forget how a couple of HIMARs changed the weather. Let's talk about F-16. They are already training Ukrainian pilots. Germany plans to buy 100 Leopard-1 tanks from Greece for Ukraine.

**ARTSRUN:** Bradley, Marder, and CV90 armored vehicles will bring more benefits during this assault than the old Leopard-1 tanks. 

Even Russian analysts admit now that Ukraine's ordinary artillery units, thanks to Ukraine's Western-oriented strategy, are superior to Russian artillery. Ukraine's 155mm artillery is more precise, has a longer reach, work far apart from each other, receives info from satellites, etc. The German artillery doctrine utilized by Russia is dying. The U.S. doctrine is winning.

There is also a political component. The government must have a very clear understanding of what it wants and what the objectives are. Lack of clear objectives leads to defeat during a war of attrition.

Let's look at the U.S.'s defeat in Vietnam. Gen. LeMay said that they lost the war because the targets of B-52 bombers were being provided by President Lyndon Johnson every morning, instead of the Generals. He was making a good point. The political leadership did not set forth clear objectives for the military. 

Russia's political leadership has the same problem today. Whatever the Russian soldiers accomplish heroically, in the end, they are going to have an outcome that's unclear. 

**KAREN:** I can't imagine heroism by Russian soldiers. 

**ARTSRUN:** There are many instances of individual heroism.

**KAREN:** *(falls into depression deeper than Mariana Trench)*

**ARTSRUN:** But it's not just Russia. Western governments are also politically timid and cautious. 

**KAREN:** But the West has announced that it will support Ukraine until every Russian soldier leaves Ukraine.

**ARTSRUN:** What really counts is the level of delivered support. Ukraine has 24 HIMARs, not 200. They don't even have every caliber of missiles. The West is delivering soon-to-be-outdated types of missiles. Jets aren't there yet; they hesitated to send them in 2022. The West is politically cautious.

**KAREN:** The West doesn't want to escalate it into a direct conflict against Russia.

**ARTSRUN:** Exactly. That's why they are hesitant. 

**KAREN:** They are also dealing with MAGA people who [support isolationism]. If they ramp up the military support now, it could backfire.

**ARTSRUN:** You are confirming my point. The West is cautious and hesitant. The West is not arming Ukraine with both hands. They approved, then disapproved, then approved the supply of jets. 

Washington Post is telling fairy tales about Ukraine using 2,000,000 shells therefore ""that's too much, the U.S. doesn't have enough reserves"", yadda yadda. Tell that to children. The U.S. reserves were calculated to hold tens or hundreds of millions of munitions, and I'm confident they do. The size of reserves was calculated with the Cold War in mind. The U.S. left the Cold War with about 40,000 artillery units. 12,000 of them were preserved in great condition. They must have a sufficient number of munitions stored somewhere. They just aren't sure if they want to deliver them to Ukraine. 

**KAREN:** Is the West betraying Ukraine?

**ARTSRUN:** Not at all.

**KAREN:** There is a firm political decision in the West to help Ukraine win the war. How and when they deliver weapons depends on how many internal barriers they must go through.

3/3/2021,The Azerbaijani Government’s Islamic Rhetoric During the Six-Week War in Karabakh,,1
8/2/2023,"Minister's mysterious trip to Meghri || Iskander vs Azeri airport || Armenia importing ""Indian HIMARS"" & French weapons || $100m for domestic mil. industry || Draft never stopped during war || Samvel Babayan's plan || Nagorno-Karabakh's secret negotiation || Little-known clashes before July","##wartime defense minister Davit Tonoyan was questioned by War Commission 

Tonoyan has been in jail for two years. He is accused of knowingly delivering ""bad"" missiles, an accusation he denies.

##... your location on the eve of the war?

**TONOYAN:** I was in a NATO country to discuss the import of weapons. On the 27th I arrived in Kazakhstan to also discuss a weapons deal. Because of COVID, it took me 3 hours to find a jet to return. 

I encountered difficulties during the flight. My jet was forced to enter Armenia through Georgia. I landed on the 28th and visited the ""bunker"" headquarters in Nagorno-Karabakh.

##... describe the bunker, who can get there?

**TONOYAN:** The bunker has multiple rooms including areas for outsiders without a security clearance. There were also special rooms with information designed to mislead the opponent. The room where secret decisions were made was not accessible to outsiders. You may have seen images of outsiders in the bunker but they weren't present during classified meetings.

##... who is Patron Davo?

**TONOYAN:** A magician who used land and air routes to make weapons appear in Armenia.

##... Turkish airforce

**TONOYAN:** Turkey sent its F-16 jets to Azerbaijan in July 2020 for military drills. They remained in Azerbaijan afterward. And the fact they were stationed so close to Nagorno-Karabakh was concerning.

Every day, around 4 jets would spend 4-8 hours in the air and fly just 25 km from Nagorno-Karabakh. They had a rotation schedule. The jets were flying so close that they would occasionally trigger the air defense systems. We could shoot them down but Russia discouraged any ""provocations"".

##... describe Turkey's involvement in the war

**TONOYAN:** They were a direct participant, not even a ""proxy"". Their F-16 jets exposed our entire air-defense system. Turkish airforce is considered quite developed even within NATO because they were one of the first to develop a unified command & intel system within the airforce. This, in turn, was connected to NATO's command & observation system. What that meant for our army can be discussed behind closed doors.

##... Armenian drones 

**TONOYAN:** We entered the war with only 6 aircraft-style drones. Nothing substantial was accomplished by the domestic mil. industry.

##... is it true that Israel planned to sell drones to Armenia?

**TONOYAN:** No. There were attempts by private entities to make arrangements but it didn't work because Israel had very large weapons contracts with Azerbaijan.

##... did you modify the Serj-era weapons purchase plan to lower the priority of drones and TOR?

**TONOYAN:** No. This perception was formed due to a lack of knowledge. No weapons have ""substituted"" others, and no weapons were given ""priority"" over others. There was an effort to *supplement* the [Serj-era] list, to acquire more than what was planned. [corraborates with claims made by Artsrun Hovhannisyan and Pashinyan]

For example, the number of air-defense units that we acquired was 20% greater than what was envisaged under the original plan. 

##... OSA-AK air-defense 

**COMMISSION:** Is the opposition wrong in their accusations that the Pashinyan administration came and suspended Serj's plans to acquire certain weapons? 

**TONOYAN:** Again, nothing was removed from the list, we only added new items. We bought multiple OSA-AK units because there was a sudden opportunity to buy them. They performed very well during the war. They were an add-on item. 

The original plan did not envisage OSA-AK because their price was too expensive at the time. We later saw an opportunity to buy them as a package at a steep discount.

##... what about TOR air-defense units?

**TONOYAN:** Similarly, we acquired several TOR units during a period when *fewer* TOR purchases were envisaged under the original plan. This was made possible through skillful negotiations and access to funds. 

##... is it true that an unprecedented number of army vehicles were imported before the war?

**TONOYAN:** I don't know if it's ""unprecedented"" but the state had placed orders for a large number of vehicles. Some of them arrived before and during the war. We encountered significant import barriers even while importing vehicles. Their shape and color were an issue. 

##... electronic warfare

**COMMISSION:** Before the war, why did you order the dissolution of all electronic warfare units in every single Army Corps, and disassemble their modern equipment?

**TONOYAN:** CoGS recommended that after detailed discussions. All I can say is even that ""modern equipment"" had a subpar performance. Not enough units, and ineffective. Maybe because of insufficient quantity, maybe because we couldn't utilize them properly. 

**COMMISSION:** You also gave the order to dissolve the central battalion tasked with anti-aircraft warfare. Our SPN-30 and SPN-40 units were supposed to combat drones, F-16 jets, or E-7 control aircraft units. Instead, they were removed from combat duty and destroyed. These were basically the older versions of Krasukha. 

**TONOYAN:** The import of newer units was underway. The department tasked with that process can provide details.

##... cutting the reserves

**COMMISSION:** Before the war, why did you eliminate the main reserves of the 1st Army Corps in the direction of Goris and Kapan?

**TONOYAN:** [Former] CoGS [Artak Davtyan] recommended it. We eliminated those reserves and formed tens of special forces units in their place. That's much better than having those reserves ""on paper"".

**COMMISSION:** [New] CoGS Onik Gasparyan regretted that decision.

##... did we need to purchase SU-30SM jets?

**TONOYAN:** Yes. The ratio of balance between Armenia and Azerbaijan in that department was zero to X. We had nothing. We also had no capability to carry out guided precision strikes on targets located far away. We've never had this before. SU-30SM was a purchase for our future.

The decision to acquire SU-30SM was originally made in 2015 but we didn't have the funds at the time. We ended up buying them [after 2018] with resources allocated from *outside* of the state budget. The Government report mentions that nuance but doesn't clarify what those ""non-budgetary resources"" mean. I can discuss that behind closed doors. *[Wasn't it something about using funds recovered by anti-corruption efforts, paid by former leaders?]*

The acquisition of SU-30SM did not prevent other weapons from being purchased. [It was earlier revealed that Armenia wanted to buy TOR units and drones but couldn't find a seller who could deliver them or deliver quickly enough, prompting the government to search for temporary alternatives without suspending the pending TOR/drone contracts.]

Additionally, we signed a Su-25 modernization contract with Russia that was supposed to take 3 years. I don't know if this process is underway or has been suspended due to the war in Ukraine. 

##... myth: draft was suspended prematurely

Context: Pashinyan has denied issuing an order to suspend the regular draft to replace it with volunteers. It was against the law to draft men who had just completed their mandatory 2-year conscription service, so Pashinyan said he used a ""loophole"" to recruit those men by inviting them as volunteers instead. Thousands of men, including Pashinyan's son, ended up joining as volunteers. It was later revealed and confirmed by an independent figure that the Armenian armies had amassed over 117,000 soldiers.

**COMMISSION:** Is it true that the official draft was stopped?

**TONOYAN:** No. The draft was never stopped. I think this manipulation is tied to the process of recruiting volunteers. There were serious issues with the draft which we can discuss behind closed doors. The main issue is that it was inherited from the 1946-1960 USSR, which had a different demographic and battlefields. This is why we launched a process to implement the idea of Active Reserves in Armenia.

**COMMISSION:** Were the reservists properly trained and harmonized with the regular army before being sent to the frontline?

**TONOYAN:** It can take months to retrain reservists properly. The entire war lasted only 44 days, so draw your conclusions. But we did have a training process, which was made longer over time. 

##... how many deserters and draft evaders did we have?

**TONOYAN:** Let's talk behind closed doors. I believe that had the war continued, we could overcome this issue because the relevant legal structures were finally starting to properly address the issue. I'm not saying the war should have continued.

**COMMISSION:** Why did we have many deserters?

**TONOYAN:** To overcome fear the soldier must be trained and prepared. Not enough preparatory work could be done because everything was unfolding quickly. 

##... resilience & threat assessment 

**TONOYAN:** According to our comprehensive calculations, which were done on multiple occasions, the Armenian army could withstand an attack by an enemy 3x its size. 

On the 3rd day of the war, considering Turkey's involvement, the Government was advised to try to negotiate a ceasefire. None of the military's prior threat assessments [2008-2010 and 2016-2018] considered a scenario in which Turkey would attack from the east. At the time of the [2016-2018 threat assessment], the geopolitical situation was different [likely refers to Russia-Turkey relations in Syria].

Our military ties with Russia also made us believe that Turkey itself would not be a direct threat. When Turkey deployed its jets in Azerbaijan's Ganja airport after the drills in Nakhijevan, I held several meetings with representatives from 12 NATO member states in an attempt to neutralize the Turkish threat. 

##... bulletproof vests 

**COMMISSION:** Were you satisfied with the state of the army at the time of your appointment as MOD? You were a ranking MOD official for years before your appointment. It turned out we were in poor shape: Improper control system for mobilized troops; lack of a digitized database of reservists; insufficient number of helmets and vests, which led to mild injuries becoming deadly and costing many lives; critically low stockpile of missiles as of May 2018 as revealed by Pashinyan. 

**TONOYAN:** I wasn't satisfied or dissatisfied with the work. The army is a living organism, it evolves and improves. The May 2018 assessment told us we could withstand an attack by a 3x greater force.

As for the vests and helmets, we had enough for active-duty soldiers but not for that many reservists. This is why our 2018-2019 report mentioned the need to purchase them. Importing vests and helmets is as difficult as importing a tank because of the same logistics/transfer restrictions. 

**COMMISSION:** Why not import ""civilian"" bulletproof vests designed for cops? I understand those aren't designed for military use but wouldn't that be better than having reservists with sweatpants and tees? [conversation is interrupted]

##... why wasn't the army brought to the highest state of combat readiness on the eve of the war?

**TONOYAN:** I believe the CoGS issued certain orders. It was in accordance with the level of perceived threat.

**COMMISSION:** What was the level of perceived threat? Give us a % number. 

**TONOYAN:** I can't give a specific number. It's either ""strongly likely"" or ""fully likely"". The threat was ""strongly likely"" after the July clashes. 

**COMMISSION:** Before the war you met with Russia's MOD Shoygu, while CoGS Onik met Russia's CoGS Gerasimov. Did your Russian colleagues tell you a major war was *unlikely* to happen?

**TONOYAN:** Let's talk about this behind closed doors. They asked us not to make provocative moves. 

##... July 2020 clashes weren't the first

**TONOYAN:** Our soldiers performed exceptionally well. I'll disclose more details. A few months before the July events there were other clashes on the AM-AZ border, regarding the need to strengthen Armenia's energy security. It was mostly the same army units that participated. It wasn't Armenia who publicized these events. The tactical-level clashes in July were overblown into strategic-level news by Azerbaijan. 

**COMMISSION:** Do you believe Armenia ""provoked"" the September war?

**TONOYAN:** We maybe ""delayed"" it or ""expedited"" it, but did not cause it. We were forced to take action *within* our borders. The response by Azerbaijan and Turkey was very disproportionate.

##... Crapstitutional reforms

**COMMISSION:** You said we had issues with the command system.

**TONOYAN:** Many legal uncertainties regarding the roles of officials and institutions during war and peace. 

##... where is MoD supposed to be located during the war?

**TONOYAN:** In the Defense Ministry headquarters. On October 21-29, I was in Meghri under the instructions of Pashinyan. Only now do I fully understand why he sent me there. As you know, Pashinyan recently revealed the existence of a ceasefire proposal that would have stationed Russian peacekeepers in Meghri [to give a corridor to Azerbaijan. Pashinyan rejected the offer. It was around October 19. The war continued.]

**COMMISSION:** What exactly were you ordered to do in Meghri?

**TONOYAN:** Our troops had sustained heavy casualties, the mayor of Meghri and the head of the Meghri military unit were wounded, and we were in the process of forming a special command system for the Southern region. My arrival had a positive psychological effect on the population and troops. 

I also witnessed how the Russian Border Guard positions were bombed. We were able to establish a serious plan of cooperation with them. I'm very grateful for that.

##... why didn't Armenia use Iskander to destroy the parked drones and jets in Azeri airports as soon as possible?

**TONOYAN:** ""Sooner or later"" is a decision made by the command. These missiles were used whenever possible and whenever allowed, and whenever they were authorized from the appropriate geographical location. *[cough Russia cough?]*

**COMMISSION:** Was Armenia NOT ALLOWED to use certain types of weapons?

**TONOYAN:** Let's discuss that behind closed doors. Hmmmm.......... but let me put it this way: We could use them but there were limitations with the geography. *[Azerbaijan possibly lobbied Russia to prevent the use of Iskanders against the territory of Azerbaijan. Perhaps they could only be used against Azeris who entered Nagorno-Karabakh? This could explain why it was used in Shushi.]*

**COMMISSION:** Did Russia ""pressure"" Armenia to agree to certain conditions so the war could end ASAP?

**TONOYAN:** Let's talk behind closed doors. But do know that the war stopped only because Russia brought its peacekeepers to Nagorno-Karabakh, not because of ""ceasefire agreements"".

**COMMISSION:** Why didn't Russia bring its peacekeepers sooner? 

##... can Armenia acquire weapons from NATO while being a member of CSTO?

**TONOYAN:** Yes. We have always imported weapons from NATO members. CSTO was never a dealbreaker. 
The real issue is with the ""compatibility"" of NATO weapons with our systems. Preparatory work is necessary.

##interview with Nagorno-Karabakh opposition leader Gen. Samvel Babayan || Secretly agreed to remove tanks || Rubern Vardanyan's ambitions || ...

Context: Babayan has been in favor of launching direct talks with Baku without a third party to discuss humanitarian topics including the use of the unpopular Aghdam road in addition to the Lachin Corridor. Babayan said that during the 1st Karabakh war, after Azerbaijan found itself in a dire state, they sent a letter to Armenia ""begging"" to use a similar road for humanitarian purposes. Babayan criticized his fellow opposition figures and Arayik Harutyunyan's government for engaging in ""traitor talk"" and avoiding responsibility and harsh realities. *""If you do not take 'unpopular' steps now, you will be forced to implement them under worse terms after a few months.""*

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan has escalated the situation by abducting a Nagorno-Karabakh citizen who was traveling to Armenia for surgery. The man is accused of ""war crimes"". 

**BABAYAN:** As I've said earlier, Azerbaijan has a list of 300 individuals they want to arrest. When I suggested holding direct negotiations to discuss the establishment of mutual trust, that was one of the reasons, but some morons described it as a selfish attempt by me to save my own skin. They didn't take it seriously. 

Now they will gradually receive more ""surprises"" because of their inaction. I've submitted a 5-point document to the President, describing what needs to be discussed with Azerbaijan. That was one of the 5 points, the so-called ""amnesty"". My proposal was ignored. Now we have the first arrest.

**REPORTER:** What is the solution? Will they return him or imprison him for decades?

**BABAYAN:** The solution is to launch serious talks with Baku and discuss the issue of every captive/hostage in one large package. There needs to be an amnesty so we can close this subject.

**REPORTER:** Nagorno-Karabakh government and opposition parties are saying Azerbaijan will use the direct talks as an opportunity to promote the ""integration"" of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians into Azerbaijan.

**BABAYAN:** I don't care what they are saying. What are *we* doing to resolve the situation? Want to fight? How, against what, and where? Show me your plan. You've got no plan. But as soon as someone presents a plan, you call him a ""traitor"". This is not a winning strategy.

**REPORTER:** Your critics in Nagorno-Karabakh call you a traitor for supporting the opening of Aghdam road.

**BABAYAN:** I've never mentioned the Aghdam road specifically. I said we must create a point of cooperation on the Askeran border so we can conduct regular trade. You *are* going to do this eventually. You claim not to want it but you *will* be forced to in 2-5 months. And when that happens, those who are against this idea today must be held accountable for subjecting the Nagorno-Karabakh population to hunger for months.

There is no other realistic option. The naysayers also don't have any solution, they have a slogan: ""We must fight now as we did during the 1991 blockade"". Listen, buddy, in 1991 we had kolkhoz, sovkhoz, lots of food reserves, and even aircraft flights delivering goods. That's how we survived in 1991. None of that exists today. Don't be delusional.

I presented my negotiation plan and invited public figures to discuss and improve it. In return, I got called a ""traitor"". Fine. I'll step aside then. You have the full freedom to act. Go *""fight until the end""* as much as you want. You will eventually understand that you have failed and you are on the brink of surrender like the ruling party ARF surrendered in August 1992. ARF surrendered and admitted they were incapable of ruling anymore. The emergency GKO committee was formed to create a new governing system. 

It's the same situation today. You have all sorts of people claiming to be the best candidate for negotiations with Azerbaijan. We have Ruben Vardanyan who said he came to Nagorno-Karabakh only recently, has never participated in prior wars, and would therefore be a great candidate for a negotiator, ""they will negotiate with me."" Fine, go negotiate. But Azerbaijan called him a Russian spy instead. 

Unable to negotiate, Vardanyan claims that if *he* can't negotiate then *no one else* should be *able to*. Vardanyan doesn't want any negotiations to take place. As an Armenian person, I demand an explanation from him. Vardanyan doesn't care about the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, he is there to inflate his personal image.

President Arayik and Sec.Con. Vitali Balasanyan spent 2 years and 9 months negotiating with Azerbaijan after the war. They discussed and resolved some issues. They even agreed to remove weapons from Nagorno-Karabakh, tanks, and other weapons. A schedule was developed to remove 56 tanks. I don't want to reveal everything. At least don't call others a traitor after having done all of that.

Do you really think there were no direct talks with Azerbaijan all these 2 years and 9 months? Russian [peacekeeping chief] acted as mediator. They met twice in Khojalu and several times before that. They addressed the [presumably joint use of a northern road in Nagorno-Karabakh] and issues relating to villages. Lots of topics that I won't disclose.

**REPORTER:** Did Arayik and Vitali agree to remove weapons during one of these talks?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. They agreed to remove 56 units of equipment within 2 months.

**REPORTER:** Was it removed?

**BABAYAN:** The first half of those 56 units were already removed. As far as I know, the second batch has not been removed.

**REPORTER:** You suggested using a border point in Askeran to conduct trade with Azerbaijan. The critics fear it can be used to promote the ""integration"" process. 

**BABAYAN:** We have a plan that touches upon 20 major topics that we must discuss with Azerbaijan. We must discuss that plan among ourselves, improve it, then send a negotiator, who will not be allowed to deviate from that plan. This is the first phase. It's humanitarian in nature, for trust-building.

If Azerbaijan displays a constructive stance and we see that they are serious about establishing trust, then we can proceed to the second phase, to discuss the political aspect of the conflict. Don't focus on whether Azerbaijan will demand their flag installed here or there, it's not time yet, we are yet to discuss confidence-building measures.

**REPORTER:** Isn't it obvious that we cannot build trustworthy relations with Azerbaijan? 

**BABAYAN:** No. It's possible. If we try and fail, if Azerbaijan refuses, only then we can confidently claim it's impossible. 

**REPORTER:** Will Azerbaijan agree to discuss those 20 topics?

**BABAYAN:** We'll send it to Baku in written form. They are free to amend and send it back. If there is a mutually acceptable part we can hold negotiations to resolve the pending issues. It is all about making civilians' lives easier. If they reject even this, then we go for another round of war.

**REPORTER:** What if Azerbaijan presents only one topic: integration?

**BABAYAN:** If you watch Azeri and international news, everyone was at first talking about ""integration"", but they have suddenly shifted the language to ""confidence-building"". 

Do you remember how Aliyev went from demanding a ""corridor"" to clarifying himself that he never actually meant a ""corridor""? Are you sure you understand the real definition of ""integration""? How do you know their definition of ""integration"" isn't something acceptable, like closer economic ties with Azerbaijan?

Azerbaijan will never listen to the world. They have their own strategy. You either fight or negotiate. Choose one. The world isn't going to rescue you. Go protest as much as you want. Nothing will happen.

If you want to fight, then at least do one of the following:

1) Gain the status of an international subject via UN's Chapter 7 so Azerbaijan can't treat you as an ""internal problem"".

2) As the legal successor of this region, as the actor who made you part of Azerbaijan during the USSR, Russia must answer for this situation and ensure physical safety.

3) Challenge Azerbaijan's claim over Nagorno-Karabakh by bringing up the legal violations in the UN. Nagorno-Karabakh was originally declared as a disputed territory by the Nations League and wasn't recognized as part of Azerbaijan. But the Nations League's successor UN, despite the presence of the same ethnic and other issues on the ground, recognized it as part of Azerbaijan, in violation of its own rules. Armenia must submit a letter to challenge the UN's decision and point out the fact that this violation has since led to 2 wars in the region.

So if you want to struggle for independence, at least do one of those three. Nothing will come out of your [President's] protests in Stepanakert. We tried that unsuccessfully in 1988. That strategy doesn't work.

**REPORTER:** Will Azerbaijan use force against Nagorno-Karabakh?

**BABAYAN:** At least not at this stage, but things change rapidly around the world. A lot depends on us. We can have a favorable outcome if we work.

**REPORTER:** Azerbaijan won't even allow the food trucks to enter Nagorno-Karabakh. Is it even possible to live peacefully with them?

**BABAYAN:** Azerbaijan wants us to buy the food from Azerbaijan (not import it from another state) and send it to Nagorno-Karabakh via Aghdam road. So tell me, did you enjoy your 20-year-long belly rub and the squandering of public resources that made all this possible? 

**REPORTER:** [unintelligable]

**BABAYAN:** Ex-president Serj Sargsyan and others talk a lot these days. What have they done for 20 years? We lost the war because they hid the issues in the army. Serj and [newly elected] Pashinyan ignored my suggestions about weapons acquisitions. I told them to either 1) buy enough weapons specified by me, 2) seek a mandate for a major power to enter Nagorno-Karabakh, or 3) accept any concession proposed by the OSCE Minsk Group. They ignored all three.

We don't have a functional state today. Look at how things are handled in Nagorno-Karabakh. They catch a random guy from the street and appoint him as a minister. The guy doesn't admit that he lacks governing skills. He [State Minister Gurgen Nersisyan] is busy yelling at tomato sellers on the street for pricing their goods above the legal caps. The guy is the head of the government. He is protesting in front of the Red Cross office with 40 others. This is us now. Why are we criticizing others?

**REPORTER:** What is Nersisyan supposed to do?

**BABAYAN:** Govern the state. They were supposed to properly distribute fuel so villagers could deliver food to cities. They have more than enough fuel for all these cars in Stepanakert but not enough for farmers? It's a result of a lack of skills to manage resources.

**REPORTER:** Why did the president of the Nagorno-Karabakh Parliament resign?

**BABAYAN:** 1) He has health issues. 2) It's mostly a political decision. They have decided to replace him with someone from ARF, to grant ARF more powers. It's a terrible idea. They are going to further destabilize the situation with that move. Besides that, ARF only has 3 MPs, we have 9, and the other has 16. What's the point of ARF agreeing to hold this position? The decision was made by an agreement between the new and old leaders [of Nagorno-Karabakh]. Apparently, they want to play with the population a little bit more. Okay, go on and play.

**REPORTER:** Do you mean ex-president Bako Sahakyan and others are working together?

**BABAYAN:** Yes. They have one goal: humiliate our population as much as possible, as long as they get to keep their lives. 

**REPORTER:** Is the Armenian government doing enough to help Nagorno-Karabakh?

**BABAYAN:** The governments of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh appear to have a strategy. I'm not familiar with the details and the steps that are being taken, but the government of Nagorno-Karabakh doesn't complain about the Armenian government that much. I'm not familiar with the content of their discussions.

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan says he doesn't have a mandate to decide Nagorno-Karabakh's fate. Is that problematic?

**BABAYAN:** Of course not. Big brother Armenia to little brother Nagorno-Karabakh should be like Turkey to Azerbaijan. The problem is, the little brother [Nagorno-Karabakh government] is hesitating to act. This is where the problem is. We must correct the mistake that began in 1999 [when Nagorno-Karabakh was removed from the negotiation table]. 

We must sit down and discuss our issues with Azerbaijan. It doesn't matter if we lost the war. We have been elevated from an object to a subject. If we negotiate skillfully, things will work out.

##interview with a military industry expert Gor Amatuni

**REPORTER:** Have you witnessed any progress in the development of Armenia's domestic military industry after the war?

**AMATUNI:** Yes, many positive changes. It's no longer the ""hell"" that it used to be. Big improvements at the Military Industry Committee, and smaller improvements in the Defense Ministry in terms of ease of working with them.

**REPORTER:** Describe some of the changes.

**AMATUNI:** Inventors and scientists are being heard and invited for meetings. ""We were finally able to reach someone knowledgable,"" they say. There is a systemic approach now. Before, the manufacturers were producing whatever they wanted or could. Now, the system describes the manufacturers how their product will be implemented and in conjunction with what other products.

**REPORTER:** You said the military industry still has issues with the Defense Ministry. Describe it.

**AMATUNI:** Mainly bureaucracy. Certain individuals within the Ministry, not the entire ministry, are corrupt. They hinder the process. There are times when we present our product that's better and cheaper than what they import, but they refuse to accept ours because it's easier for them [to skim by forging the import records]. 

**REPORTER:** What limitations does our domestic industry have?

**AMATUNI:** A small country like Armenia cannot produce weapons on its own, we need to partner with international players, and we do. Our military industry must produce AND import. We have partnerships with several states: India, Greece, Cyprus, France, etc.

**REPORTER:** Indian press was excited that a foreign state [Armenia] has finally signed a large-scale weapons contract. But do we have a problem with delivering those weapons to Armenia?

**AMATUNI:** The deliveries are successful despite some difficulties. Items that cannot be delivered in one piece are being delivered piece by piece. Do know that we are importing weapons not just from India.

**REPORTER:** From where else?

**AMATUNI:** Several states, including a NATO state. Let's not open the parenthesis for now.

**REPORTER:** Is Armenia's membership in CSTO not an issue for the NATO state?

**AMATUNI:** There are NATO countries that want to help strengthen Armenia. There are always ways to import technologies, visible or invisible. The NATO country in question is France. Not everything is ideal yet but things are moving forward now. [Last month we learned that Defense Minister Papikyan visited France to discuss military cooperation. Pashinyan later described his visit as ""successful"" but didn't reveal details]. 

**REPORTER:** Are these steps helping restore the military balance in the region?

**AMATUNI:** Our #1 opponent in the region is Turkey. Obviously we are not as powerful as them but the goal is to be able to make war too costly for your opponent by being able to conduct strikes critical for them. We are working towards that.

**REPORTER:** But isn't our #1 opponent Azerbaijan?

**AMATUNI:** Azerbaijan is nothing without Turkey. We would have torn them into pieces if it wasn't for all the assistance from Turkey. I don't make such claims without evidence. In reality, several states are working against us, including Russia today. So we must develop our domestic military industry to turn Armenia into a hedgehog. Touch me and you'll be stung.

**REPORTER:** What else can you tell us about the cooperation with France?

**AMATUNI:** When people hear ""weapons"" they often only think of a gun that shoots at you. But there is a lot more than that. France is the strongest state in the EU. Today, steps are being taken to ""cooperate"" with them, it's not just about receiving aid. There are serious efforts to cooperate with France, Greece, Cyprus, etc.

**REPORTER:** Any efforts to train our soldiers in France?

**AMATUNI:** France could send a few experts to Armenia, we don't need to send our soldiers there. Modern training is conducted with digital joysticks, not Soviet-style spetsnaz training. One guy with a joystick could kill a battalion's worth of enemy troops. There is some progress in this area, too.

##more jihadist videos arrive

[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/j4mbdw/oct32020_wrapup_war_in_karabakhartsakh_the_most), we saw a video recorded by a Syrian mercenary *(who mentioned the word Armenia)* inside an Armenian armory that they captured. The same armory was also filmed by the Azerbaijani army and uploaded on the internet, thus confirming that they have jihadists.

Videos: https://t.me/reartsakh/4131

&nbsp;

Middle East reporter shared a video of one of the Syrian jihadists who was allegedly killed in Artsakh. ""He is among 55 corpses that were transported to Syria last night"", said the reporter.

##a few more things from yesterday

Armenians had closed dozens of streets in Los Angeles demanding action against Azeri-Turkish aggression. They blocked the CNN headquarters to demand objective news coverage.

&nbsp;

Non-government sources have identified the names of 70 more deceased Azeri soldiers not reported by Azeri authorities. Part 1 had some 240 names. ""The real numbers are much higher,"" said the group.

**00:12:** electricity was partially restored in the capital Stepanakert after yesterday's bombing by Azerbaijan. 

https://news.am/arm/news/605900.html


**00:45 Artsakh president:** I'm still in the front while handling politics remotely. After heavy battles, we improved our positions and built a ground for future successes. After failing in the front line, Azeris resumed bombing the civilians. This war crime will not go unpunished. We will win and punish those who threaten our existence.

https://t.me/infocomm/22022

Artsakh president Arayik uploaded a photo with the boys. ""Coffee in the front lines"".

https://factor.am/290683.html

**12:03 army:** we destroyed 2 tanks and 3 aircraft in the south.

https://factor.am/290694.html

**12:56 military expert:** the destruction of Ganja airport was important. It's only 61km away. Turkish jets fly from there within seconds. A few of them are probably destroyed. They would need to use another airport, further away from the front, which could give Armenians time to analyze and learn the enemy plans. Turkey coordinates it's jet attacks from headquarters in Kars, Turkey. 

https://orakarg.com/41558

**13:26 Artsakh president:** if the Azeri govt doesn't learn from this, we will continue to strike and dismantle the enemy's rear and the army. I've asked the army to stop the fire for now to prevent casualties among the Azeri civilian population.

https://factor.am/290706.html

**13:43 military expert:** all the responsibility for Ganja and other future strikes are on the Azeri govt shoulders. There are already reports of civilian and police clashes amid dissatisfaction with authorities.

**18:49 Ilham Aliyev:** the conflict with Armenia should be resolved through dialogue, but there needs to be a foundation for it. Pashinyan needs to agree that he supports the old agreements which state that the Karabakh territories are recognized as part of Azerbaijan. Pashinyan needs to apologize that he called our lands ""Armenia"".

https://factor.am/290821.html

**19:44 Pashinyan to German Bild outlet:** this isn't just a local security issue. 

First, Turkey imported jihadists from Syria. 

Second, Turkish soldiers are directly involved. It's part of their ""Turkish empire"" ambitions which we also see in Libya and the Middle East. 

Third, Turkey is back for another genocide. Their goal is to absorb Azerbaijan and ends its independence. 

Fourth, if Europe doesn't assess the situation accurately, they should expect Turkey at the gates of Vienna.

**21:07 NSS (FBI) reports:** unknown resident(s) reported several foreign citizens with suspicious activities. We detained them for questioning. It was revealed that they were gathering info about our internal troop movement, size, locations, names. The suspects, along with their Armenian-citizen accomplice, were arrested. 

https://news.am/arm/news/606023.html


**21:10 army:** Today alone, Azeris left 400 dead, 700 wounded, 13 armored vehicles, 3 aircraft, 1 UAV. Our losses will be announced when we properly identify and verify.

Lots of misleading information was shared by Ilham Aliyev. We saw how they congratulated themselves with capturing Mataghis. Today we published videos showing how Azeri soldiers were running away from Magathis under our artillery fire.

Today they spread another misinformation about Jabrayil capture.

Aliyev is under an information blockade. He is not being briefed properly. He is being fed false information, which he tries to use to sell a big victory to his people.

Our airstrike on Ganja airport shows how little Aliyev cares about the Azeri population. Not one step was taken by him to organize a civil defense program since the beginning of the war. All while the Azeri army knew that them attacking our cities would result in our counter-strike on their military base in Ganja.

Today's battled weren't as fierce and Azeris failed to conduct anything significant because the Turkish aid was somewhat neutralized thanks to our air defense and other measures. Turkish UAVs were unable to work, hence the insignificant gains, heavy losses, more retreat.

Our soldiers have incredibly high morale, especially the conscripts and their commanders. We have heroes. One artilleryman received a wound but kept shelling the opponent's positions until the last bomb, before seeking treatment.

""The question is, did the United State build these jets so Turkey can use them to bomb innocent civilians?""

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1030346.html 

**22:24 Pashinyan to France24 TV:** Azerbaijani public is a victim of a dictatorial regime. Armenians are a ""convenient enemy"" that Aliyev uses to divert attention from lack of freedom of speech, democracy, human rights, and socio-economic hardships. Social media is severely limited in Azerbaijan. The same family has ruled Azerbaijan since 1994. Meanwhile, Karabakh has changed 4 presidents.

**Washington Post Op:** Erdogan’s reckless intervention is fueling fighting in Azerbaijan and Armenia. Trump should tell Erdogan to stand down.

Azerbaijan’s autocratic ruler, Ilham Aliyev, has launched an offensive to regain the territories his country lost in the 1990s. He is doing so with the direct support of Turkey.

Turkey was once a reliable NATO ally. But in the past several years Mr. Erdogan has increasingly sought to make his nation into a geopolitical power

It’s not clear how far Russia will go to stop the Turkish-Azeri offensive; Mr. Pashinyan was democratically elected in 2018 after a popular uprising, and so is no favorite of Vladimir Putin. But it is in the U.S. interest to stop the fighting and restart negotiations.

##Syrian jihadists recruited by Azerbaijan upload more videos, further proving their presence 

In case you're a new reader, check out the links above for previous stories. Turkey has helped Azerbaijan to recruit Syrian jihadists, some of whom are ISIS commanders.

&nbsp;

PM Pashinyan shared the video in which Syrian jihadists are seen using Azeri vehicles and uniforms while shooting towards Armenian positions.

""The Armenians of the world must put this outrageous fact before the world and focus on the following agenda. Condemnation of the terrorist attack on Artsakh and recognition of Artsakh's independence""

Syrian jihadists *(possibly Turkmen from northern Syria?)* uploaded a video from one of the areas they occupied in the first week, along the southern borders with Iran, south of Jabrayil.

The video shows a sign in the Armenian language that reads ""Attention, border line. Entry only with a passport.""

One of the jihadists, while speaking in Arabic, is seen showing the hand-sign of a Turkish terrorist organization 'Grey Wolves'.

**9:04 U.S. Representative TJ Cox:** The United States must stand up against terrorism and act now. Azerbaijan's complete lack of respect for the ceasefire is one of the reasons why the United States should suspend military assistance to Azerbaijan, punish Azeri officials for the losses of hundreds of human lives, and review our diplomatic relations with Turkey. For two weeks now, they've been violating human rights and continuing the violence against Armenians. 

https://factor.am/293995.html
 
 
 
 **10:37 Artsakh president Arayik's press conference:** Azerbaijan is not respecting the ceasefire agreement reached in Moscow. 

Azerbaijan has brought international terrorism to the region. The facts are overwhelming and have been verified by the international community.

Azeris use Smerch, Polonez, and suicide drones against Armenian civilians and civilian infrastructure in the capital Stepanakert and elsewhere. The church in Shushi has no military object, yet it was bombed several times. Azerbaijan's goal is ethnic cleansing. 

Artsakh will not be part of Azerbaijan. 

I've lived many proud moments by meeting courageous soldiers in front, but I'm also proud of everyone for providing aid to Artsakh refugee families, collecting financial aid, and your calls for the world to recognize the Artsakh Republic.

We're in constant communication with the govt of Armenia. They provide us all the necessary humanitarian aid. We keep them informed about the situation in front lines. 

If the Azeri-terrorist coalition doesn't display signs of willingness to resolve the conflict peacefully in the next few days, I'll ask the Armenian government, and the rest of the world, to officially recognize the Artsakh Republic. We will see which countries respect human rights and which ones support terrorism.

I bow to the courageous soldiers in front lines. There are hundreds or thousands of examples of heroic actions; we will talk about them later. ""Ձեր բոլորի ցավը տանեմ։""

About Hadrut. Since Aliyev had earlier claimed he had captured Hadrut, yet just hours before the ceasefire he realized his troops were far away from Hadrut, they chose their last attack to be on Hadrut. They formed an infiltration group, possibly also consisted of special forces of a foreign state. They infiltrated the city but we pushed them back. Today, Hadrut's mayor is in the city hall. I just spoke with him minutes earlier. You draw conclusions.

The government of Israel is also responsible for Azerbaijan's ethnic cleansings because they intentionally continue to supply them with suicide drones, even though the drones were meant for Azerbaijan's self-defense. Israeli govt preferred money over God's values.

""Aliyev's actions are the continuation of the ethnocide of Talysh people.

5 of the deaths occurred post-ceasefire, 4 of whom were in Hadrut during the Azeri infiltration activities yesterday (including the mother and her disabled son).

There is evidence that Azeris mutilate deceased bodies, which is banned by international law.

Azerbaijan used illegal weapons and cluster bombs against Armenian civilians. The unexploded ones can cause damage years later.  

5800 buildings, 960 infrastructure objects, and 520 cars are seriously damaged in Artsakh.

##""This isn't out war"" / Talysh minorities complain about Azerbaijan's discriminatory draft & hate speech

[A few days ago we learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/j42mlr/oct22020_wrapup_war_in_karabakh_azerbaijan/?) how the government of Azerbaijan intentionally drafts disproportionately higher numbers of ethnic minorities. A new report came from Talysh activists. 

**The letter reads:** There is no military solution to this conflict, as it will only lead to problems for future generations. We are extremely concerned about the steps taken by the Azerbaijani authorities to send the Talysh to the battlefield.

We condemn the government's efforts to sow hatred in our community towards Armenians. Most Talysh people are dissatisfied with this situation. 

On the one hand, the government of Azerbaijan suppresses freedom of speech. On the other hand, it is exploited by those with close ties to the government to present as if there is hatred of Armenians among the Talysh.

We call on the Azerbaijani government to finally end its policy of sowing hatred. We urge the Talysh not to engage in hate speech. We urge them to refrain from participating in clashes. We have never been an opponent of any people in our history; we will continue this path.

##Azerbaijan's use of illegal cluster bomb on civilians

**The Telegraph:** ""Azerbaijan dropping cluster bombs on civilian areas in war with Armenia."" The Daily Telegraph saw evidence of the banned munitions' use in the capital of Karabakh.

The munitions, which scatter tiny bomblets over a wide area, are banned under a global treaty because of the risk they pose to civilians, especially children.

On a downtown street full of shops and housing blocks, large quantities of the bomblets - small cylindrical tubes about the size of a film can - were left scattered on the concrete. Several had failed to explode, posing an ongoing risk to passers-by.

Russian journalists run for cover and record the moment the rocket hits the ground capital Stepanakert (1:39 mark).

""There are no military objects here. It's downtown. Only civilian shops and districts. A mine's tail was left on a balcony. Lots of damage.""

##the 1,500 Syrian jihadists

**Foreign Policy writes:** Turkey has sent ~1,500 Syrian mercenaries to Azerbaijan after 5-60 day training, according to our source. They went from Syria to Gaziantep, Turkey on September 25th. 

They were offered $1,500/mo to sign a 4-month contract. Now, many regret signing it after learning about the death of 55 mercenaries. *(learn to code then)*. They were mislead about being sent to guard facilities.

""There is no communication between us and the Azerbaijani forces,"" one of the militants based in the Barda region of Azerbaijan told Foreign Policy. ""All militants are dissatisfied with the situation in Azerbaijan. The psychological atmosphere is very difficult.""

The arrival of 55 corpses near Aleppo village was tragic. They hadn't seen anything like that before. Turkey will pay $7,800 to the families of the deceased.

##the fight against terrorism

Artsakh government plans to creature a coalition to fight terrorism. The Artsakh Parliament has contacted Iran to create a joint task-force ""to locate and destroy the terrorists"". 

""Terrorists fight against our homeland already disguised under the flag of a UN member state Azerbaijan, in the regular army of Azerbaijan. Everyone saw and recorded the entry of the global jihadist network into Azerbaijan. This terrorist cell is being fed by Turkey. 

As the president of a state fighting for its independence, I call on the civilized world to take an active part in this struggle. Creating an effective and efficient global anti-terrorist coalition is imperative today. I am sure the victory will be ours,"" said Artsakh president Arayik Harutyunyan.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1030620.html , https://news.am/arm/news/606431.html

**Sometime before or after:** President of Iran Rouhani spoke with Ilham Aliyev and informed him that Iran is concerned with the involvement of ""third countries"" in this conflict and the disability in its northern borders which could open the doors for terrorists.

##a few more things from yesterday

**Artsakh President Arayik:** yet another day with a stable success in the front. The army has accomplished the task brilliantly and is currently successfully defending in the air and land while inflicting heavy losses on them. 

This was the reason why the Azeri army fired over 100 Smerch missiles on the capital Stepanakert. 

I was also informed that the diaspora has already donated $50m. Thank you. We will restore the ruins after our victory. This unity of ours is proof that Azerbaijan has already lost.

**MFA:** this attack is happening while Turkish MFA is in Baku, and just hours after OSCE released a statement calling for a ceasefire. All the responsibility of consequences is on the Azeri govt shoulders. 

**Army:** explain this to the terrorists. The area near Araks river is flat plains, while our soldiers are mountain eagles.

We have intel about the involvement of thousands of terrorists from several cells. Al Nusra terrorists are also being deployed there.

This is concerning because they could enter other neighboring countries including Russia.

As a result of our strikes, not only have large enemy reserve forces been destroyed, but there have been long traffic jams on the highways to Baku for two days now. *(civilians moving away from areas with military objects)*

▶︎ They burn wheels and release them into the villages to target the collected grass. Cattle breeding is the only livelihood of many people.

▶︎ They steal cattle and use loudspeakers to threaten the peaceful Armenian civilians working in fields. 

▶︎ These could not have been coincidences, it is a series of intentional acts managed from a command point.

##Nagorno Karabakh calls on superpowers to formally recognize its independence and ""nullify the existential threats facing its population""

The statement by Nagorno Karabakh Parlaimentarry parties sends a message to the West, Russia, and the World.

##... to West

Accepting the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples as enshrined in Article 1 of the UN Charter, as well as the ruling of the International Court of Justice according to which the declaration of independence of Kosovo did not violate international law, we call on [every country] to recognize the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, thereby nullifying the most serious existential threats facing its population.

##... to Russia

You have just recognized the independence of Donbas. We have also exercised our right to self-determination in 1991 from a legal point of view, in accordance with international law, the principles of democracy, and the USSR legislation in force at that time.

##... to World 

The world recognized Azerbaijan as an independent state within the limits determined by the internal legislation of the USSR. According to that legislation, at the time of Azerbaijan’s gaining independence, Nagorno Karabakh had nothing to do with that country, otherwise it would not have been included in the United Nations, thus, the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan has nothing to do with the Nagorno Karabakh Republic.

##leave your homeland and go live elsewhere if you don't want to become Azerbaijani citizens | Dictator of Azerbaijan threatens ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno Karabakh who don't want to accept his rule  

Azerbaijani president Aliyev was asked whether it's true that he has agreed to hold direct talks with Nagorno Karabakh Armenians. 

**Aliyev:** Yes. There have been informal talks with Karabakh Armenians for quite some time now, and we plan to continue it. I think it will convince Armenians that the only option is to integrate into Azerbaijani society. 

Those who want to live as citizens of Azerbaijan won't regret it, but if there are people who don't want it, they can choose another place of residence. //

##U.S. again calls on Azerbaijan to withdraw its troops from Armenia 

**Carpenter, U.S. representative of OSCE:** The U.S. remains deeply engaged in helping AM and AZ work toward a peace agreement. Jake Sullivan met with Hikmet Hajiyev and Armen Grigoryan at the White House on September 27 to advance the peace process. 

On October 4, Anthony Blinken held a trilateral call with FM Mirzoyan and FM Bayramov, during which he encouraged confidence-building progress in their talks. Blinken also expressed our appreciation for the positive steps AM and AZ have taken towards reaching a sustainable peace agreement, including and importantly the return of 17 Armenian POWs.

##... about the video showing the execution of Armenian POWs

**Carpenter continues:** The surfacing of an appalling video appearing to show Azerbaijani armed forces executing unarmed Armenian prisoners must be fully and impartially investigated. Those responsible for any abuses of detainees must be held to account. 

We take note of the inquiry which has been launched by the Prosecutor General of Azerbaijan and remind the parties to abide by their commitments to swiftly return all prisoners of war and to treat such prisoners in accordance with their international obligations.

##... about the September 13 attack 

**Continues:** The violations of ceasefire on September 13, 14, and 28, are of grave concern to the U.S. We encourage AM and AZ to strictly adhere to a ceasefire, pull back and distance their armed forces, and continue negotiations on border delimitation to support a peaceful resolution. 

We reiterate our call on Azerbaijan’s forces to return to their September 12 positions. Border disputes must be resolved through negotiations, not violence. 

##... about OSCE 

**Continues:** We strongly support the activation of the OSCE’s confidence-building and conflict prevention instruments, including the establishment of a Fact Finding Mission, as has been requested by Armenia.

We urge AM and AZ to take urgent steps to de-escalate tensions, build confidence, and hold themselves accountable to international obligations and commitments. We encourage further progress in resolving the issue of missing persons and the return of all remaining prisoners of war. //

##Germany's largest party SPD responds to Azerbaijan's military aggression and war crimes:

Azerbaijan's violation of the borders and the territory of Armenia cannot be justified in any way.

We've followed with dismay the recent escalation on the AM-AZ border, including the attacks on homes and civilian infrastructure within Armenia.

A large number of deaths and injuries in Armenia, the escape of many Armenian residents from their hometowns, and the reports of war crimes committed by Azerbaijani soldiers against Armenian captives are unacceptable.

We welcome the recent negotiations and the release of 17 Armenian POWs and urge AM and AZ to continue the dialogue. The Nagorno Karabakh conflict also needs to be resolved. 

We call on the German government and the EU to follow the events, exert more effort, and not accept any violations of international law. //

##EU's statement after the Thursday meeting between the leaders of AM, AZ, EU, FR 

**Statement:** Armenia and Azerbaijan confirmed their commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and the 1991 CIS Declaration, through which both recognize each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

They confirmed it would be a basis for the work of the border delimitation. The next border commission meeting will take place in Brussels this month.

Armenia agreed to facilitate a civilian EU mission alongside the border with Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan agreed to cooperate with this mission as far as it is concerned. 

The mission will begin this month and last 2 months. Its goal is to build confidence and contribute to the border commissions of AM & AZ. //

##Azerbaijan can no longer make territorial claims, must pull back troops from occupied parts of Armenia: Ambassador-at-large Marukyan

**Edmon Marukyan:** Azerbaijan has agreed to cooperate with the EU's border mission. Therefore, any possible future aggression by Azerbaijan will be monitored on the ground, furthermore, the part of Armenia’s sovereign territory that is already under Azerbaijani occupation will be recorded. 

Let me remind you that on October 5, EU's [foreign minister] Josep Borrell had stated that the EU wanted to send a monitoring mission to the line of contact but the mission wasn’t dispatched because Azerbaijan opposed it. 

Azerbaijan has agreed to recognize Armenia in accordance with the UN Charter and the 1991 CIS Declaration, after which Azerbaijan can no longer make any territorial claims against the sovereign territory of Armenia in the delimitation process, which also means that the Azerbaijani military must withdraw from the territories it has occupied until this moment. //

[source,](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1094345.html)


##what do we know about the border monitoring mission from EU?

**Question:** EU's statement says that AM and AZ have agreed to abide by the UN Charter and 1991 CIS agreement on the mutual recognition of borders and territorial integrity. Does this mean Azerbaijan must withdraw its troops from Armenian territories occupied in May 2021 and September 2022?

**Foreign Ministry:** We have repeatedly stated that the territorial integrity of Armenia is not subject to negotiation. The statement by the EU is an important step towards restoring Armenia's territorial integrity. The UN Charter and the 1991 CIS agreement will be the basis for the development of a Peace Treaty and border delimitation. 

**Question:** EU's statement says nothing about Nagorno Karabakh. Did the leaders discuss it? How will the decision to recognize territorial integrity affect the Nagorno Karabakh issue?

**Foreign Ministry:** As we've stated in the past, the key issue is the security and rights of the people of Nagorno Karabakh. This is being discussed during every meeting, including with foreign partners. Azerbaijan does not want to discuss it directly with Armenia. 

Our international partners agree with us about the need to clarify the security and rights of Nagorno Karabakh Armenians. This is why it's important to hold direct talks between Stepanakert (Nagorno Karabakh) and Baku (Azerbaijan), with the formation of an internationally visible mechanism. Armenia raises this issue during every meeting with Azerbaijan.

**Question:** Armenia has agreed to place an EU monitoring mission on the AM-AZ border, whereas Azerbaijan will ""cooperate with this mission as far as it is concerned"". What does this mean? Did Azerbaijan not agree to the mission?

**Foreign Ministry:** Armenia has always insisted on the placement of an international mission. The EU mission will operate on the AM-AZ border, within the sovereign territory of Armenia. There is no question of Azerbaijan's agreement or disagreement. 

**Question:** Where exactly will the mission be deployed, and what will they do?

**Foreign Ministry:** The goal is to strengthen trust and assist the border delimitation/de-escalation commissions of AM and AZ. It's too early to say where they will be deployed, it's being discussed.

[source,](https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1094408.html)



##Russian Senator about the EU's border monitoring mission 

**Sergei Tsekov:** The prospect of concluding a peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia can only be assessed positively. Direct dialogue is necessary between the parties. The main thing for the EU's civil mission is not to interfere with this process.

We hope the EU's mission will contribute to the formation of a peace treaty, and not provoke new conflicts. The EU is not a very trustworthy negotiator. Establishing a direct Armenia-Azerbaijan dialogue is more important.

##the Azeri infiltrator who killed an Armenian teenager in 2014 attempted to commit self-immolation in front of Ilham Aliyev's office 

Context: [Shahbaz Guliyev and his accomplices](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/utc8i1/may192022_your_daily_news_digest_from_armenia/) infiltrated the border to spy on Armenian soldiers in 2014. They killed a civilian Armenian teenager during the process. Guliyev was captured in Armenia, and later sent back to Azerbaijan after the 2020 war as part of the prisoner swap. After returning to Azerbaijan, he admitted to being a spy and explained the infiltration details.

Guliyev has long complained about socioeconomic difficulties and being neglected by the Azerbaijani government. During the latest protest on Friday, during which he demanded a disability status and a pension, Guliyev attempted to set himself on fire but was stopped and detained by officers.

##... about the government's plan to create a ""sovereign wealth fund"" and raise taxes on the mining industry 

**2019:** The Government creates ANIF (Armenian National Interests Fund) with a mandate to attract foreign investments, grow exports, and co-finance investments.

**2021:** The Government raises taxes on copper-molybdenum miners, citing their ""unfair superprofit"" amid rising global metal prices. The plan is to spend the new revenues on a sovereign national fund, the processing industry, and the development of the copper manufacturing ecosystem. *""More specifically, we plan to deepen the value chain of copper processing and establish a high-purity cathode copper production, followed by the development of an adjacent copper ecosystem.""*

>Long-term, we plan to review the taxation policies and to create a ""Sovereign Wealth Fund"" investment fund, which will receive the revenues deriving from these reforms. Many countries already have such Funds that manage the revenues collected from mining. 

**2022:** Possibly related. The government ""nationalizes"" ~22% of Armenia's largest miner/taxpayer Zangezur Copper Combine.

The recent follow-up inspection has found that some of the problems were not addressed. The agency has issued an order to suspend the operation of Petak mall.

The merchants working at the mall organized a protest in front of the Government building. ""We weren't given a heads up.""

##are you a Diasporan looking for opportunities to visit Armenia and contribute?

In 2003 Edele Hovnanian founded ""Birthright Armenia"" *(aka ""Depi Hayk"")* with the belief that it is every Armenian's birthright to see Armenia and have a hands-on experience.

The program participants agree to volunteer 30 hours a week *(no work experience required)*. They live with a local host family, improve their Armenian language skills, interact with other Diasporan participants, travel every weekend and gain knowledge about the country.

Thousands of Diasporans aged 21-32 have participated in this volunteering program. Hundreds of them have settled in Armenia.

##AI is a human assistant, not a substitute: Krisp co-founder 

**Artavazd Minasyan:** The AI is in the embryonic stage of development in Armenia. There are scientific groups and companies that already have technologies and clients, but it doesn’t reach major volumes, this requires constant investments.

AI is becoming one of the main branches of the global economy, enabling the automation of processes to save time and money. Armenia cannot ignore it. We must produce new scientists and engineers. //

##another interview with military expert Artsrun Hovhannisyan about army reforms 

*With popular demand.*

**Question:** What do the soldiers need before they reach the front lines?

**Artsrun:** They need to train with modern standards, not the Soviet mechanisms. The more intense their training is, the better. This applies to Ashkharazor (Territorial Defense Forces), reservists, and volunteers. This is being done today to the best of our abilities.

The troops today do not have a lot of time and resources to deal with volunteer squads constantly. The adoption of one of the pending resolutions in parliament will address many problems: there will be a training process for the aforementioned groups and even civilians. 

They must have physical strength, the ability to shoot, the ability to navigate the terrain, and basic knowledge of weapons and tech. After the law is adopted, it will no longer be necessary to complete this process in a hurry within a week. 

Instead, there will be seasonal training that can last a few months, for proper training. Other countries do it for 30-40 days. A former serviceman can be brought to combat state with a 30-40 day retraining. 

Armenia has long had many private military training organizations but they are disorganized and unregulated. I'm studying the experience of other countries to help draft a law to regulate this. Hopefully will be ready this winter. 

**Question:** Is it true that only the poor are being summoned?

**Artsrun:** No. Reservists are summoned based on their profession, the type of mission, etc.

**Question:** Tell us about September 13 attack.

**Artsrun:** We have soldiers who are just now leaving the trenches after being there since the night of September 12. Many of our boys committed heroism. I'll write about it later. 

**Question:** What do soldiers need on the front lines? 

**Artsrun:** The army provides the necessities, but we could always use մանր-մունր things like warmer clothes, more socks, etc. There is never ""too much"" of those. The food is great, but some kids prefer to eat more chocolate, more than the army delivers.

##the battle of Qarin Tak & невероятные приключения Գյուլլնազ տատի
 
**Russian reporter Kotenok:** I got a report that on October 31st the Turkish-Azeri infiltrator group suffered heavy losses and were thrown back. The 200-member group reached Qarin Tak [2km south of Shushi] and tried to bypass the Armenian troops to enter Shushi.
 
The group was equipped with Turkish and Pakistani special forces, Syrian mercenaries, and members of Azeri ""052 Yashma"" special forces. They fell under Armenian fire and were destroyed. Armenians mostly used mortars and rifles against the enemy that was trying to settle on top of a hill. After leaving 50 dead and wounded, the infiltrators retreated.
 
The second group of Turks tried to advance but was stopped under a fire. After this, the Azeris haven't tried an attempt in this direction. *[on November 1st the army spokesman Artsrun did mention something about ""Hell Gorge"" and how Azeris were ambushed, might be this incident]*
 
After this incident, Azeris began circulating rumors that the attack was actually called off because 300 Russian Wagner Group mercenaries are allegedly in Shushi, so they didn't want to engage the Russians.

A reconnaissance group clears the area, followed by Armenian soldiers advancing to engage Azeri-Turkish infiltrators [it's unclear if it's near Hadrut or Shushi].* At the 5:52 mark, you can see a column of Azeri infantry moving on the hill.
 
Armenians call the artillery and retreat to wait. Smoke is seen in areas where Azeris were spotted. During the battles, 3 Armenians receive a wound. Azeris left 15 dead.

##November 2 // battlefield & analysis // international response & diplomacy
  
**8:51 WarGonzo reporter:** about Azerbaijan bombing the Shushi Mosque yesterday [outer wall and nearby car were damaged]. It was likely a 60mm NATO-supplied mortar used by forest infiltrators. It lacked the shrapnel that's commonly seen in 82mm Soviet-made mortars. 

Our sources have confirmed that sometimes the infiltrators will sneak forward and use these lightweight mortars against the civilian infrastructure of Shushi.
 
https://t.me/wargonzo/3919
 
**10:42-14:23 MoD:** there were battles yesterday and last night.
Azeris once again used their entire weapon arsenal against Artsakh. They attacked in several directions but could not advance. Azeri column was found and destroyed towards Shushi direction.
 
At night, in the southeast, Azeris tried to bring armored vehicles. We shot one tank; they pulled back the rest. Several columns were found and destroyed.
 
Azeris bombed civilian settlements at night.

**13:17:** Artsakh president Arayik Harutyunyan met the volunteer soldiers from Vladimir Balayan and Shahen Meghryan groups.
 
""We will still have many opportunities to talk about their heroic deeds for the salvation of the homeland, but in the meantime, we must meet to issue awards.
 
In the first war, we used to name our groups after Tigran Mets, Aramo, Arabo, but today they are named after the heroes of the First Artsakh War. And the sons of these heroes continue the struggle against the world's most high-tech army, and destroys it.
 
Near village Avetaranots (6km Shushi), Roland Aydiyan and his Meghryan Group neutralized 20 Turkish special forces. Only 2 enemy soldiers stayed alive and escaped. I'm awarding four soldiers from Meghryan group posthumously now and will have time to talk about the rest of you.
 
Alexei Balayan (Vladimir Balayan Group) called me last evening and said they detected terrorists in front. He wanted to go forward and engage. I prohibited and said don't take the risk. Then 7:00 am in the morning he calls and says they captured one terrorist alive and can capture more, but I told him his men's lives are worth a lot more than the terrorists so the risk isn't worth it.
 
Alexei Balayan receives a Combat Cross medal. [lists several more recipients]
 
Alright, go take a rest now before a new mission,"" said Arayik.

**13:53:** Yezidi-Armenians are forming the third group of volunteers, said Yezidi MP Rustam Bakoyan.
 
""From the beginning of the war, the Yezidi community was ready to take part in the battles, because the citizens of Armenia, regardless of ethnicity, must defend the homeland. 

On the evening of September 27, the first detachment was formed in the Yezidi sanctuary of Aknalich.  The number of those who wanted to join was so large that the second group was formed, which is currently undergoing military training. At the moment, the third detachment is being recruited. ""

**14:35 Pashinyan:** Let's establish the facts. Azerbaijan, with a 10 million population and massive oil revenues, has admitted after the July-2020 events that it's incapable of solving its security tasks on its own, and opted to recruit thousands of mercenaries. We already have the proof.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1033599.html
 
**14:38:** Nari Nersisyan and four of her female friends have also decided to join the army. ""For a while, we tried to help soldiers as much as we could by other means, but eventually decided to join the front lines. At first, we were concerned about public perception and our physical abilities, but the practice has shown that all the fears were unwarranted. Our soldiers should know that they aren't alone and we're ready to stand next to them.""
 
The five were joined by a group of other women. Hundreds have applied. The MoD is currently organizing their unit.

""It has been repeatedly reported that the executive branch did not allow photos from victims' funerals, and sometimes even treated the family members rudely. I think this is absolutely unacceptable. It is possible that for security reasons some institutions instructed it to be kept secret. This does not mean that it should be accompanied by violence,"" wrote the lawyer.
 
https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1033632.html
 
**17:55 army spokesman Q&A:** some soldiers stay in front lines much longer because it's impossible to conduct shift rotation, especially if it's still being attacked. 

Even if you manage to change the troops overnight, the new ones won't be as effective and knowledgeable, which could compromise the security. The new troops must adapt first, which is impossible during intense battles. There is a shift change in relatively milder areas.

**18:44:** 50 Armenian and international ecological organizations have raised the alarm about Azerbaijan's intentional torching of 1815 hectares of Artsakh forests with the use of white phosphorus bombs.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1033659.html
  
**22:00 army spokesman Artsrun's briefing:** as announced earlier, last night Azeris launched multiple attacks in the north-west direction. Both attacks were repelled. Some of them were trapped and destroyed completely.
 
Around 7:00 Azeris attacked near Martakert-Martuni (center front) and southern front. All attacks were repelled. In some locations, they were chased and our troops captured some positions. 

South of Martuni (towards Chartar) Azeris took 1-2 positions; later we launched artillery strikes and caused heavy casualties to them in these positions.
 
The battles continue. Overall, all the attacks failed today. They used mostly groups of infantry and aviation. We monitor the enemy's movements and penetrated mainly with artillery.
 
In some areas, Azeri bodies have been lying on battlefields in front of our positions for 20-30 days. Azerbaijan refuses to collect them because they don't care about them. 

Today, near one of the villages in the Hadrut region, Azeri groups left 15-16 dead bodies and routed. Sometimes the bodies can cause issues with disease, sometimes not.
 
The Azeri infantry and armored vehicle fleet have sustained significant damage. It's visible in the past 10 days. They often use mercenary terrorists who attack without armored vehicles, although they try to aid them with air and artillery.
 
Q: is it true that Azeris can monitor every location and movement of our positions?
 
A: entirely possible, since Turkey is in charge of the Azeri army and uses its equipment. But it's not a catastrophic thing. We also have reconnaissance tools. It's not just about hiding, it's also about misleading the enemy with your actions.
 
Q: who produced and sold the phosphorus bombs to Azerbaijan?
 
A: we're investigating.
 
The war continues. The enemy continues to attack in all directions with the use of a wide range of weapons. We carry out our defense duties appropriately by causing heavy casualties to the enemy. 

The war is hard but I'm confident that our soldiers are in charge. They gain experience day by day. They study the enemy, better analyze their plans, and find better antidotes against their high-tech. Be confident, we will win.

Former Turkish PM Ahmet Davutoğlu called Erdogan a bigger danger to the world than the COVID19. 

""The greatest threat to Europe and the world is the dictatorship spread by populist leaders like Mr. Erdogan. As long as our people suffer, there is deep corruption, and the dignity of our country is insulted abroad, we will continue to call for early elections.""

Recep Erdogan purged the Turkish air force after the 2016 failed ""coup"". 300 pilots were arrested. This devastated the air fleet. To partially cover the losses, Erdogan instructed some retired pilots to return to force and to train new ones.
 
There was also an issue with a law that made it easier for pilots to voluntarily quit and join the private aviation industry.
 
By 2016 the army needed 554 new pilots, and 1154 by 2017. Turkey began recruiting pilots from Pakistan. The USA, however, prohibited the F-16 jets to be flown by Pakistanis. 
 
Greek outlet writes that Turkey is once again asking Pakistan for help with F-16 jets.

##the economy
 
**Deputy PM Mher:** It was possible to ensure a stable micro-business environment despite the pandemic and the war. It's unprecedented. It's a result of effective cooperation with the Central Bank. 2021 will be a tense year but I'm sure we'll approve a suitable budget.
 
**Finance Minister Atom:** the 2021 budget assumes a 6% economic fall in 2020, and 4.8% growth in 2021. These predictions can change.
 
With the restoration of demand, inflation is expected to approach the lower limit of the target.
 
The year began with high growth but COVID stopped it. April was the worst. Slightly recovered in May when physical restrictions were lifted. Got worse again in June, followed by improvement in August. The Services industry was hit the worst.
 
The Debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 65% in 2020 and lower to 63.2% in 2021.
 
**Central Bank president Martin:** The state budget deficit relative to GDP will reduce by 2% in 2021. After the debt expansion in 2020, there will be a certain restraining policy in 2021 guided by the principle of ensuring medium-term debt stability.

8/30/2023,Aliyev admits he has blocked Lachin || Azerbaijan will poison the food passing via Agdam: Nagorno-Karabakh residents || Armenia acquiring hundreds of 155mm Indian howitzers || Uniparty system in Azerbaijan || Nagorno-Karabakh govt. discusses international peacekeepers || Energy sector liberalization,"##""Azerbaijan will send poisoned food via Agdam road"", ""they want to feed us before murdering us"": residents of Nagorno-Karabakh 

Azerbaijan has blocked the Lachin corridor since December 2022 and has fully cut off the delivery of food since June 2023, in violation of the World Court order to lift the blockade. Deaths caused by starvation have already been recorded. Families are forced to register to receive bread from bakeries; the lines are formed starting at 4 a.m. because the supplies are scarce. Starting today, each family will receive no more than 1 bread per day.

Azerbaijan has, for months, blocked the entry of dozens of cargo trucks sent from Armenia, causing a humanitarian crisis. Now the Aliyev regime wants to pretend that it cares about the well-being of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, complain the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, who are concerned that Azeri food trucks will contain poisoned food.

Nagorno-Karabakh's main opposition figure Samvel Babayan has [proposed a plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/15m6e4j/us_sources_have_offered_a_near0_interest_loan_to/): Open the Lachin corridor and the Agdam road. Allow free movement of goods and persons between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. Install laboratories near the Agdam road to check the safety of incoming food from Azerbaijan, and allow the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh to conduct trade with Azeri businesses if they wish. Let the ""market"" decide where the products should come from.

Azerbaijan has so far refused to hold negotiations with Nagorno-Karabakh in a location that would guarantee the physical safety of the Nagorno-Karabakh diplomats.

**Analyst Karen Hovhannisyan:** By offering to send ""food aid"", Azerbaijan has admitted the existence of the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh, something they have denied until now. //

The Nagorno-Karabakh government has accused Azerbaijan of attempting to ""aggravate and not solve the existing problems"".

**Government:** The Lachin corridor should operate freely. If the Azerbaijani authorities are truly interested in ending the gravest humanitarian crisis and genocide of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, they should not play fake humanism, but simply not prohibit the resumption of supplies through the Lachin corridor. //

**Nagorno-Karabakh residents gathered near the Agdam road:** We won't accept anything from the murderer [Azerbaijani leader Aliyev]. We will not allow an ant to cross this road. This is a road of death, not life. This is the latest state-sanctioned show by terrorist state Azerbaijan, which has never pursued a peace agenda towards us. Our parents were murdered during the ethnic cleansing in Sumgayit and Baku [Azerbaijan]. Meanwhile, Azerbaijani authorities continue to spread hatred towards ethnic Armenians. Open the Lachin corridor immediately, remove the illegal checkpoint. //

##Azerbaijan's policy towards Nagorno-Karabakh is illegal and immoral: France

**Catherine Colonna, FM of France:** The strangulation strategy aimed at provoking mass emigration of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh is illegal, as the World Court has already determined. This policy is also immoral.

France will mobilize forces to establish a just and lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan. A just and stable peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan will also allow the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their homeland and their rights, culture and history will be respected.

##Macron held a phone conversation with Pashinyan and Aliyev

Pashinyan spoke about Azerbnaijan's illegal blocking of the Lachin corridor and the need to take steps to end the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh. 

Macron also called Aliyev to discuss the Lachin corridor and the Agdam road. Aliyev admitted that the Lachin corridor is blocked, suggesting that Armenians can use the Lachin corridor by going through its customs checkpoint *after* they agree to use the Agdam road.

##update to the kidnapping of 3 ethnic Armenian students by Azerbaijan army 

*Context: Yesterday Azeri soldiers forcefully kidnapped 3 residents of Nagorno-Karabakh who attempted to travel via the Lachin corridor that has been illegally blocked by Azerbaijan against World Court orders. They will be deported to Armenia soon, and will not be allowed to return back to their homeland. It's a ""one-way trip"" policy by Azerbaijan to depopulate Nagorno-Karabakh.*

Protests were organized in front of the Russian embassy in Armenia for allowing the students to be kidnapped. Russian peacekeepers were supposed to accompany the students. 

Armenian media outlet 5TV (Robert Kocharyan) reported that Russian peacekeepers got into a scuffle with Azeri forces in an attempt to protect the students, but the eyewitnesses have a different account of the events. 

Multiple witnesses have reported that the peacekeepers did nothing to prevent the kidnappings. One of the students, who was not kidnapped, recalls how the kidnapped student asked the peacekeepers for help during the physical altercation with 7 Azeri agents but received no assistance. He was beaten and struck multiple times with a rifle in various parts of his body.

##Nagorno-Karabakh government discussed the idea of deploying international peacekeepers 

The current and former leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh, joined by Parliament MPs, public figures, and civil society activists, held an emergency meeting last night to discuss the situation.

**Activist Artur Osipyan:** The topic of holding negotiations with Azerbaijan in Yevlakh, Azerbaijan, was discussed but [the location is unsafe] and it would allow Azerbaijan to treat the situation as an ""internal matter"", which is unacceptable. The same about the Agdam road. It's part of Azerbaijan's goal to subjugate us. If we agree to this, they will demand the dismantling of our defense forces as the next step. This will be followed by Azerbaijan sending police forces to Nagorno-Karabakh, leading to the final destruction of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

Multiple scenarios were discussed for opening the Lachin corridor. Two of us supported the idea of organizing a march towards the illegal checkpoint in the corridor. 

No final decisions were made during the meeting because we're waiting for a response from Russia. 

We also discussed the involvement of international peacekeepers. I get it, we heavily depend on Russian peacekeepers, but the idea that requesting international peacekeepers could upset Russia and prompt them to leave no longer matters because we are going to collapse due to a shortage of food anyway, so what do we have to lose? The Parliament MPs did not explicitly support the idea of requesting international peacekeepers. It's strange. What are they waiting for? We will know more in the coming days. //

**Nagorno-Karabakh president after the meeting:** It is necessary to restore the unobstructed traffic through the Lachin corridor. We are ready to solve the problems through constructive negotiations with Azerbaijan. //

##Aliyev regime is creating a uni-party system in Azerbaijan by outright banning opposition parties: opposition figures from Azerbaijan

**Azerbaijan's National Council of Democratic Forces:** Ilham Aliyev has pursued a policy of eliminating all opposition throughout his 20 years of rule. The latest anti-democratic law targets the political parties and is meant to destroy the true opposition. It will essentially make it illegal and criminalize opposition parties. We are headed to a monarchy.

This is an assault on the entire population of Azerbaijan, who are being deprived of peaceful means to change the government. We hope the international community will address Ilham Aliyev's attempts to establish a uniparty system in Azerbaijan. 

##... what is in the new ""uniparty"" law?

A political party must have >5,000 members to be officially registered as a party. It will lose registration if the numbers drop below 4,500. There are other minimum requirements as well.

Even popular opposition parties are struggling to meet all the criteria under the new law. ""The requirement to go through a state registry is a tool for the government to destroy opposition parties, especially the Popular Front, because it will be able to use the list of members to put pressure on people,"" said an opposition figure.

Various European institutions have criticized the new law.

##a private investor will build a large thermal power plant to sell electricity in Armenia's newly liberalized energy market 

Tashir Group will invest >$26m to build a new ""unique"" gas piston power unit, ""the first of its kind in Armenia"". 

Unlike in the past, when a company had to sign a deal with the government to guarantee the purchase of electricity, the new plant will instead find consumers and sell the electricity ""directly"" to them through the wholesale electricity market, which was established by the government in February 2022.

The construction will end in August 2024. Another 3 months will be required to connect it to the power grid. If necessary, it can be quickly connected to the power system to cover the peak power load or be shut down.

7/24/2023,Russia washes its hands off from the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis and shifts the blame to Armenia with a disingenuous claim: Analysis by Tatul Hakobyan and Petros Ghazaryan.,"**TATUL**: Azerbaijan continues with its inhumane policy of starving Nagorno-Karabakh with a blockade. Today we'll discuss possible solutions.

**PETROS:** We first need to understand who is responsible and what can be done. Russia's foreign ministry has accused the Pashinyan administration of making it ""impossible"" for Russian peacekeepers to help Nagorno-Karabakh, citing ""Pashinyan's recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh's status within Azerbaijan"". This has energized the pro-Russian opposition forces in Armenia: *""See! Russia has named the real traitor!""*.

But Russia is manipulating.

Armenia has not signed any agreements recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan. Pashinyan said he is willing to do so if Azerbaijan can guarantee the rights and protections of ethnic Armenians. If not, then we won't sign it. Russia's foreign ministry and pro-Russian opposition forces in Armenia understand this but they'd rather engage in demagoguery. 

Besides that, there is a tripartite Nov. 9 agreement, which Russia says is still active and valid, stating that Russia must guarantee the free movement in the Lachin Corridor, so it doesn't matter what the Armenian government is willing to sign in the future.

**TATUL**: Last year Azerbaijan rejected Russia's proposal that would have postponed the discussion of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. *[Context: Russia proposed delaying talks around the Nagorno-Karabakh status. Pashinyan agreed, calling Russia's solution as his preferred choice. He went to Russia to negotiate with Aliyev but the latter rejected Russia's proposal. Russia did nothing to promote its own proposal, prompting criticism and disappointment from Armenia. Afterward, the parties began to heavily prioritize the platforms offered by the Brussels and Washington instead.]*

**Tatul continues:** Russia knows very well it was Azerbaijan that rejected their proposal, not Armenia. 

Let me remind you that, even before Pashinyan's announcement about his readiness to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan IF Azerbaijan provides strong guarantees, well before this statement, Russia was already failing to follow its duties. 

The Khtsaberd incident, the capturing of dozens of Armenian soldiers, and Russia not securing their return to Armenia took place well before Pashinyan's statement. 

The invasion of village Parukh [and Russia's refusal to remove Azeri soldiers] took place well before Pashinyan's statement. 

**PETROS:** ... and the blockade of the Lachin Corridor that began 7 months ago and Russia's refusal to open it took place several months *before* Pashinyan's statement.

Azerbaijan invaded hundreds of km^2 of Armenian territories. Armenia asked for assistance from Russia but received a rejection. Why? There were no EU border observers in Armenia at the time. The EU observers were brought in response to Russia's inaction.

Our opposition is for some reason obsessed with justifying Russia's inaction at any cost. 

Our opposition also claims that Russia didn't provide military assistance because Armenia ""refused to fight"", so Russia didn't want to do all the work for Armenia. But we did fight in September, yet still didn't receive assistance. Russian border guards, instead of helping, withdrew their positions from the border.

Doesn't the ostrich Maria Zakharova not see and know about this?

Aren't the hungry people of Nagorno-Karabakh fighting tooth and nail today? Yet they still receive no assistance from Russia...
  
**TATUL**: Russian peacekeepers are currently delivering food with helicopters for themselves while the children of Nagorno-Karabakh are starving to death a few kilometers away.

Now let's discuss several possible solutions.

Solution 1. Armenia pressures Azerbaijan to reopen the corridor. This cannot work at the moment because Armenia's military is not yet powerful enough.

**PETROS:** Some figures in Armenia are calling for Armenians to apply force. This would be an excellent gift for Azerbaijan, giving them the legitimacy to invade even more territories and invade all of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

**TATUL**: Solution 2. The international community pressures Azerbaijan. In this scenario, the civilized world, which is the Western powers in this case, could exert enough influence to end the blockade. But we must remember that the same EU is receiving the [banned] Russian gas through Azerbaijan today. Azerbaijan is marking Russian gas as its own before exporting it to the EU to bypass the sanctions. Everyone knows about this but it's being ignored. Nevertheless, as an active member of international platforms, Armenia must carry on with the efforts to remind the international community to pressure Azerbaijan.   

**PETROS:** Many major international institutions/organizations have already sided with Armenia and urged Azerbaijan to lift the blockade. But we shouldn't stop there.

**TATUL**: Solution 3. Russia pressures Azerbaijan to lift the blockade. But I think Russia doesn't want to pressure AND couldn't pressure.

**PETROS:** However, the latest statement made by the foreign ministry of Russia is a word-by-word copy of Armenia's policy. In it, Russia demanded Azerbaijan open the Lachin Corridor *immediately* and to create international mechanisms for the protection of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. Their message mirrored the Armenian narrative. This prompted Azerbaijan to send a note of protest to Moscow; the ambassador was summoned.

**TATUL**: Solution 4. Armenia asks Turkey to pressure its little brother Azerbaijan. This may seem far-fetched, but it has been done in the past, during the era of the first republic. At the time, the bread and oil were entering Armenia exclusively through Azerbaijan. In the summer of 1918, Azeris cut off the flow to pressure Armenia. Armenia's foreign minister Khatisyan asked Enver Pasha [the co-organizer of the Armenian genocide just 3 years earlier] to pressure their brother Azerbaijan to resume the flow. This is part of our history that isn't being mentioned much.

**PETROS:** I think some people would have an acute psychiatric episode if they heard this. 

**TATUL**: Solution 5. A direct dialogue between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. I've been speaking about this for 1.5 years. Sadly, the government of Nagorno-Karabakh still rejects this idea. I don't know why they fear a direct dialogue. [Only one figure in Nagorno-Karabakh has the courage to publicly support it: Gen. Samvel Babayan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/14jvrcl/direct_negotiations_between_nagornokarabakh_and/) You could always reject Azerbaijan's demands at the end, but at least go and talk to them. *[Context: Nagorno-Karabakh president has revealed that Azerbaijan was demanding the dissolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh defense army as a precondition for direct talks. The Nagorno-Karabakh side wants negotiations without preconditions, and wants to be recognized as an ""equal party"".]*

Scenario 6. Azerbaijan successfully carries out ethnic cleansing and genocide. This is where we are headed unless things change.

**21:00 Pashinyan addresses the nation:** proud citizens of Armenia, Artsakh, and the diaspora. It's been a month since the Turk-Azeri-terrorist army wage a war against Artsakh and Armenians. Thousands of bombs have been fired at civilians, thousand of drones. The enemy attacked with tanks, jets, helicopters, Azeris, mercenaries, Turkish and Pakistani special forces.

A month ago they had a plan to bring Artsakh to its knee. Yet today, although wounded, Artsakh is standing, thanks to primarily our heroic army and heroic public.

This cruel but heroic process reassures us that Artsakh will continue to stand because our spirit is unbreakable. 

The war has entered a stage where every moment it collapses the illusions that the opponent had. The military-political leadership of Azerbaijan has fed so much ""victory news"" to the Azeri public, that every moment the Azeri public awaits news about Artsakh's final fall.

The Azeri public, however, will not receive that news. They will not get it. And it is this indefinite expectation of this news that will collapse the Azeri plans to invade Artsakh.

Artsakh's people, Armenian people, all Armenians will fight until the end for every tree, for every stone and every millimeter, and the counter-attack at the right moment will have a disastrous effect and will collapse the opponent. Developing that moment [counter attack] is the task of the Artsakh army and we must aid them in any way possible. 

To solve the aforementioned problem we need national unity. Military orders must be carried out unconditionally. Those who disobey must be held accountable because Artsakh is at stake.

I'm aware that my yesterday's speech [about Armenia's willingness for ""painful"" mutual compromise] raised some questions and discussions. It was aimed to inform the international community about our constructive stance and the determination to secure rights for Artsakh. 

We must use the energy for Artsakh. Everything and everyone for Artsakh. Every part of the govt works to resolve problems and improve efficiency. Our resources aren't unlimited, but Artsakh's defense army has enough weapons and the potential to carry out its missions.

Yes, we have many enemies around the world, but we also have allies who have/are/will stand next to us. Armenian people won't forget that.

We must defend Artsakh's right to self-determination. This war must be a top priority for all of us, and we will win. This war has radically changed the perception of the Artsakh war around the world. 

International leaders today openly state that Azeris and Turkey are the aggressors. The use of terrorists by Azerbaijan has been confirmed in the world. This was possible partly due to our diplomatic work. 

Diplomatic work is done to show the world that Azerbaijan has never wanted to go for any concessions. This fact gives international legitimacy for Artsakh Armenians to fight until the end.

Let's agree not to be afraid of anything and not to allow the internal and external actors to stoke doubt in our free and happy future.

You are a victor, Armenian nation. Go and take your victory, create your victory, and have no doubt that your government will not stop guiding you the way to victory.

Glory to freedom, glory to the Republic of Armenia, Glory to the Republic of Artsakh, Glory to the Armenian army and the soldier, Glory to children who will live in free and happy Armenia, free and happy Artsakh. Thank you.

**22:00 army spokesman Artsarun's briefing:** in the morning Azeris launched an attack in different directions. They shelled civilian settlements, as mentioned earlier.

The northern front was relatively less tense. 

The fight continues against infiltrator groups in several villages in the center-east [map shows slightly north of Hadrut]. It's mostly inside forests. It's usually small groups that carry light weapons. They flee and hide after our attack. Later they try to infiltrate from other locations. These light-intensity fights happen 24/7 here.

In the south, there are battles along the Vorotan river basin [which stretches north towards Lachin]. Today Azeris tried to organize an attack with the use of drones and artillery towards Lachin [further north] and towards the Armenian border [further north-west], but they were repelled and did not succeed.

As you can tell by the map [presents a map], after having some success in the plain flatlands, Azeris and international terrorists are trying to attack the mountains, but successes are not easy for them. That's a harder task and the battles are heavier for them.

The war continues. It's slightly different now, however. The battles aren't as heavy and fast, although they are still heavy battles on mountains, forests, and gorges. 

Several infiltrator groups were neutralized today. A few more routed, leaving behind equipment.

The nature of today's war is slightly unusual, slightly difficult. The enemy has lost its overwhelming advantage and equipment advantage, partly due to the terrain of warfare, the improvement of our tactics, our experience. 

Therefore the situation is slightly different today. I can't give you all the data dynamically because the dynamics are not the same anymore, it has changed. 

Be confident. We will win.

The Central Bank predicts that the GDP will decline by 7% instead of 6.2% that was calculated before COVID's second wave and the war.
 
12-month inflation was 1.4%. The Services sector is still heavily affected by COVID, which will delay economic recovery.
 
The upcoming ban on Turkish products won't cause any significant price hikes for Armenian consumers.
 
Money held in savings accounts declined by ""tiny 1%"" for two reasons: compensating for COVID-related income decline, and soldiers cashing out some funds for the family before they leave for front lines.
 
The refinancing rate will remain the same 4.25%. The interest rate on funds obtained from banks will be 2.75%.

**7:39**: a rumor circulated from a sketchy Azeri social media outlet that an Azeri general [Mais Barkhudarov](https://youtu.be/ZRt5dk02ZaA?t=8) was captured by Armenians last night. He is a major figure and was promoted as general after April 2016 bates. No official sources confirmed the rumor.

What do we know so far? General Barkhudarov was promoted and was leading the Azeri 2nd corps. Yesterday, the Armenian army reported capturing Azeri vehicles belonging to 2nd corps after a counter-attack. 

Later, Armenia officially denied capturing the general but said they haven't identified all the dead Azeri bodies after last night's battles, so the general's body could, in theory, be among them.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1029180.html

**13:48 Armenian MFA:** Artsakh is fighting against the Azeri-Turkish alliance. Turkey is directly involved and is supplying personnel and equipment. They are helping Azerbaijan to continue the century-old genocidal activities in the South Caucasus. The Turkish-Azeri murderous alliance is a threat to the people of this region. Armenia and Artsakh are determined to resist and neutralize the threat. Azerbaijan will be forced to cease its attempts to solve the conflict with the use of force.

https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1029219.html


**14:05 Artsakh army:** we are currently dealing heavy blows to the enemy in the frontlines. Azeri forces, joined by Turkish and terrorist groups, are receiving a harsh response. They are spreading misinformation about big successes.

**14:25 BHK MP addresses Azeri minorities:** My message is to ethnic minorities of Azerbaijan: the Talysh, Tat, Tsakhur, Avar, Lezgins. Open and read the names of Azeri soldiers who were killed. They are mostly minorities. Why is Aliyev's fascist regime using you and your children as pawns? Take your kids away. Shield them. Disobey Aliyev's orders. This is not your war. They are sending you to die on the Armenian Karabakh mountains. Save your children's lives. Today Aliyev stopped international flights to prevent you from leaving in the event you don't want to take part in his crime.

**15:04 what did Pashinyan and Aliyev agree upon during Dushanbe Meeting in 2018?:** During an interview, Pashinyan said that when there was a mass pro-democracy movement in Armenia in 2018, he launched an open dialogue with the Azeri public to talk about internal Azerbaijani issues. The excited Azeri public made calls for a similar revolution in Azerbaijan.

When he met Aliyev, the latter asked him to tone down the pro-democracy rhetoric aimed at the internal Azerbaijani situation, because Aliyev had concerns that the situation was destabilizing in Azerbaijan ""and could threaten his dictatorial regime."" 

""Aliyev didn't care about the Karabakh conflict. He was afraid that the wave of revolution would reach him.""

Pashinyan exposed the aforementioned in response to Aliyev's claim that Pashinyan had asked Aliyev for ""time"" to sort things out in Armenia after the revolution.

Pashinyan confirmed the existence of this agreement with Aliyev, saying ""internal issues in Azerbaijan is not on my agenda"" and this ""agreement helped establish peace on the border and save Armenian lives"".

**Context:** Armenia and Azerbaijan would end up establishing a lengthy ceasefire until a verbal escalation by Azerbaijan in 2019, followed by Pashinyan's claim that ""if Azerbaijan refuses to discuss the possibility of Artsakh being free then Artsakh is Armenia, period"". This phrase was followed by a brief period of verbal exchange, but the two sides relaxed and even organized a surprised humanitarian mission in which Armenian and Azeri journalists visited one another's country to ""move people closer"". Things got worse again in 2020 after the oil plummeted to record-low and Turkish currency kept nosediving amid a worsening economy and Erdogan's reckless foreign policy.

Azeri-Armenian hostilities began during WW1, Russian Civil War, and the Armenian genocide. Lots of massacres, genocide, and ethnic cleansing. Armenians see Azeris are just Turks. (Many Turks feel the same way) Tensions were stomped out by the totalitarian Soviet regime after its establishment. After the Soviet union disappeared, ethnic hostilities resumed. Stalin also conducted a massive amount of border shifting and changing during this time period, basically ruining regional stability in the Caucasus. Anyways, all this hostility culminated into this:

Large-scale military conflict after Soviet dissolution over a small autonomous republic populated by ethnic Armenians. Decisivie Armenian victory, Azerbaijan suffered a humiliating defeat with heavy losses despite their numerical superiority in regards to arms, aircraft and personnel. Became frozen conflict, clashes on border ever since. Its been escalating since 2014.

Artsakh (Armenian name for Karabakh) is strategically important for Armenia. This region prevents the Armenian region of Syunik from being sandwiched by Azerbaijan, who claims the region (and most of Armenia) and its historic territories.  

Most Armenians know about this quote, but to shed some light on the strategic importance of this region...

>""If we lose Karabakh, we turn the final page of our people's history."" - Monte Melkonian, Armenian national hero

**The clashes going on in the border regions are combined arms in nature, this is the closest both countries have been to all out war in 25 years.**


----------

Azerbaijani military launched a few small scale combined arms offensives near Martakert and somewhere in the southern border regions. They managed to make around 5 gains, 3 of them being reversed by the Armenians.

*""Officially""* around 12 Azeri troops and 18 Armenian troops have been killed. Azerbaijanis had one Mi-24 helicopter gun ship shot down, along with one tank being blown up. Armenians so far have lost an undisclosed number of tanks, so have the Azerbaijanis although this hasnt been fully confirmed yet. Most civilian causulties so far are Armenian. Azeris entered a village near Talish, and executed three elderly ethnic Armenians. Cut their ears off. One Armenian soldier (idk if he was dead or alive when it happened) was beheaded by Azeris and paraded in front of some civis. One 12 year old Armenian boy killed in shelling.

>Something you guys need to keep in mind: Both MoDs LIE ALOT about their causalities and number kills inflicted upon the enemy. Beware of the propaganda. Id say the Azeris tend to exaggerate alot more than the Armenian MoD. (At least initially. Video footage suggests that dozens more Azeri troops have been killed. Special forces unit was decimated near Talish apparently.)

>Im Armenian and I have been following this conflict since I could remember. Feel free to ask me questions, Ill try and answer them as objectively as I can. Feel free to correct some of the information about the recent territorial changes, Im not fully updated on those and the reports coming in are very confusing 

 
IMHO, War has restarted. No more clashes. This is all out war being waged by Azerbaijan in the Karabakh region. If it spreads to Tavush (Armenian northern region) expect Russia to invade Azerbaijan. If it spreads to Nakchivan expect Turkey to get involved. (Its their only border with Azerbaijan and can easily be overrun by Armenian Armed Forces)

",1
11/10/2020,The Prosecutor General of Azerbaijan appealed to the UN Commissioner on Terrorists Fighting in Karabakh by Armenian side.," The Prosecutor General's Office of Azerbaijan said that the Armenian military-political leadership and diaspora took part in hostilities in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan in gross violation of human rights and international humanitarian law, as well as the provisions of UN Conventions.  Invitation and funding have been identified.",1
10/2/2020,Drones and the Second Nagorno Karabakh War,"Besides our perpetual Culture War there is a real war going on. Warning: war footage in links but no gore.

Armenia and Azerbaijan are fighting what is the first all out war between reasonably well equipped states in decades. 

In the 90's  [armenian forces took](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War) the disputed Nagorno Karabakh autonomous region, populated by armenians but made part of the Azerbaijan soviet republic by Stalin, and some nearby areas that were populated by ethnic azeris before the war.

The internationally unrecognized  [Republic of Artsakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh) controls this land with massive support from Armenia proper and has strongly fortified it. Russia is allied with Armenia and provides them with weapons. The morale is high as armenians believe that they will suffer another ethnic cleansing and/or genocide if they lose and they are probably right given [the Safarov case.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramil_Safarov)

Azerbaijan wants Nagorno Karabakh back and being an oil-producing state has much more money then Armenia to put into weapons. And it paid off.

Since the beginning of the war azeris posted lots of footage of their drones [(UAV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle) hitting the armenians hard.

For example [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcZOCfCkt_I) shows them hitting frontline air defence systems. There are lots of other videos on /r/CombatFootage showing drones attacking at least [a dozen T-72 tanks, artillery, MLRS, ICV, trucks, infantry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDUncGw_54E) and even [cities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESyiaVrqIyE). 

The main culprit is the turkish [Bayraktar TB-2](https://imgur.com/h86uiiC) drone. Turkey is supporting Azerbaijan due to linguistic and cultural ties and also oil. Turkey has an old grudge against armenians and Erdogan is ramping up turkish nationalism for political reasons so they will keep supplying Azerbaijan with how many drones and ammunition they need. It is rumored that the drone operators of Azerbaijan are in fact experienced turkish officers that have already used TB-2 in anger in Kurdistan, Syria and Libya wars. Turkey is also rumored to have recruited fighters from Syria in the last month and sent them to the NK war and there are supposedly frictions between the islamist fighters and azeri civilians which are shia and usually less religious than Middle Eastern muslims. But there are many rumors on the internet about this war, so take them with a grain of salt.

Another effective type of drone are [israeli kamikaze drones,](https://twitter.com/TSKMap/status/1311229071200858112) also called [loitering munition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Harop) which is kind of a funny name, unless you are killed by them like the poor souls [in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUzCm40wlDQ) Israel is another supporter of Azerbaijan because they both have hostile relations with Iran. When the Russian tzars occupied the Caucasus, they only took Northern Azerbaijan from Persia, which is now the independent Azerbaijan. South Azerbaijan is part of Iran and [azeris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Azerbaijanis) form 16% of iranians, so a strong azeri secessionist movement is a real danger for Iran. 

With this web of regional power interests there is a risk of the war spreading, but I'm not too worried. The alliance between Armenia and Russia covers only Armenia proper, not NK, and hopefully Erdogan is not that crazy to attack Armenia or the large russian base there. Russians sell weapons to both sides and despite being allied with Armenia have good relations with Azerbaijan.

The war looks brutal. Azeri drones have hit the armenians hard, but most [azeri ground attacks have been repulsed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hejuzmQ7tI4) with only modest territorial gains. Azeri hopes of an [Operation Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Storm) were dashed by  determined armenians soldiers entrenched in rough terrain, so the war looks like is becoming a war of attrition. If armenians don't find or recieve from a weapon system that can deal with drones they will suffer terrible losses until they will be unable to hold Nagorno-Karabakh and prevent the predictable ethnic cleansing of that region. 

The success of azeri drones will be a wake up call for armies across the world. Drones like TB-2 are small and can fly low so they are hard to detect by radar or hit with AA systems and when using them against frontline targets sending fighter planes against them is both difficult and risky as it puts the planes in range of enemy AA. Plus, drones are relatively cheap, don't result in human losses for operators and don't require large air bases as staging areas. 

Russian bases in Syria successfully resisted [surprise drone swarm attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmeimim_Air_Base#Drone_attacks), but they benefited from a strong concentration of AA assets and the drones were probably not sent by a strong military. 
Defending a country from a massive drone attack supported by electronic warfare, fighter jets, long-range AA missiles etc looks far more complicated.

A global arms race is going to start not only to equipp armed forces with drones but also in creating defence systems that can defend an entire army against them like effective anti-drone MANPADs, improved jamming, anti-drone drones, etc  

For now, light AA guns and AA machine guns might enjoy a return to armies inventories from which they were displaced by rockets while tanks look increasingly obsolete.",1
11/10/2020,The was in Nagorno-Karabakh is over,"After 45 days of bloodshed, the war is over. Armenia and Azerbaijan under the direction of Russia signed a pact ending the war, and also changing the dynamics in the region.

Azerbaijan keeps all territory they had captured during this 45 days war, plus, according to the deal, they will also be given the rest of the disputed territory, except nagorno-karabakh itself, which will remain under ""Artsakh"" administration. This is a big victory for Azerbaijan, since they saved their selfs war and soldiers for a pocket of territory which would demand the energy put for the first 45 days of war if not more, and they get it without using any energy. *But the biggest* losers here if one looks at the macro, are the *western imperialists*, and the *bigger victors* are *Russia and Turkey.*

Lets explain why. First, we need to consider the government of Armenia. The current government of Armenia which came to power after the ""velvet revolution"" started as a pro EU movement, before settling to something in between, meaning that they decided to start flirting both sides, Russia and EU. Of course, like history has chosen, flirting can only be a small intermediate stage. And this is proven yet again here. Russia of course cannot but hate this flirting.

One thing is obvius: The person who signed this deal of surrender, will be out of government soon, and along with everyone associated with him. It is only natural, once support from nationalists is over your days are numbered.

And what is better for Russia than having the people of Armenia ousting this flirting western comprador called Pashinyan? Already, 17 parties have signed a join letter demanding his government resignation. Here is an importand quote from the letter

>During this period, the government showed its obvious inability, inability to meet internal and external challenges. Human and territorial losses, incomplete relations with Armenia's allies and, first of all, with the Russian Federation, make the bankruptcy of the current government obvious.

What this means is that the opposition parties are accusing Pashinyan and his government of flirting with the west, thus jeopardising the nation's position in the globe. They correctly accuse him of taking the stable relations with Russia to a breaking point, and putting the country *from being in one camp, to being in between two camps*. A country between two camps would make the camp *farther* to the country hesitant to help it, especially when they are by half part of the enemy camp too, which is also *closer* to the country in question. The camp which has the country by half in its camp, and is also *closer* to the country, is eager to *end this two-camp situation*. This is what happened here. Russia wins the full partnership of the *new* government which will come. Hence, Russia will become stronger in the international arena. 

Here, we analysed  how and why the western imperialists lose on one side. Now lets see how Turkey wins, and how the western imperialists lose from this side too. As we have analysed previusly, the Turkish comprador bourgeoisie have become *too strong* to remain as the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie want them, *just a comprador*. They want to compete or be part of the camp in *equal terms* with the other majort states within the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie camp.

If this happens, the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie *lose greatly*, and one of these sub groups within it, *France*, and even some smaller compradors, *Greece*, dont want to see Turkey arising so much. It is their greatest fear. France will have a *competitor* in the middle east and in the sahel too. This means smaller *profits* for the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie to *spread* to their *labour aristocratic* *masses*, and seeing how france politics are now also *dominated* by FREXIT, due to the fact that many people *dont rechive* *anymore* the part of the pie offered by the cosmopolitans, their biggest fear which their politican leadership depends to, is to *lose more* of this pie. The only country directly threating this pie from their camp is Turkey. Turkey is the *greatest* intra-opponent of France. They did lose Mali politically recently, and they are desperate to keep the country de stabilized and in war (we will analyze this in a coming article). Thus, with this victory of Azerbaijan, the *direct* comprador of Turkey, Turkey becomes more of a power in the region, and opens room for it to be more indepentent. Turkey will need to establish *more* compradors for them to one day become an autonomus cosmopolitan camp *separate* from EU-NATO, and this war was one of these comprador creation projects. The stronger Azerbaijan is, the stronger is Turkey.

Thus, t*he more indipentent and stronger* is Turkey, *the more* the imperialist cosmopolitan bourgeoisei *lose*.

This war, which took proletariat lives, benefited *only* the bourgeoisie. The *only* positives is that the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie lost, and that this *sensless* nation to nation bloodshit ended. This war also proved the *incopentense* of the communist parties in both countries, which desided to support the war in their sides instead of seizing the moment to enlarge themselfs.

This should serve as a lesson to the current and future generations of communists worlwide. It is in these situations where the party should become stronger. If it fails, it can only sink deeper to *irelevance*.

8/29/2021,[Diplomacy] Take it or Leave It (Proposal for Solution of Karabakh Issue),">\[2nd round of peace negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia hosted by Russian Federation in state head level attendance.\]

After the latest confrontation on the region in 2020 the peace negotiations that has been aimed in the result of the ceasefire couldn’t be reached. As had been shown by our side Azerbaijan is fully committed for solving the issue involving Karabakh and hostilities between the Armenia and Azerbaijan. After a period of consideration and planning we are offering another draft for a possible peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

**1)** **Status of Armenian Enclave in Karabakh.**

We are considering giving the defacto claimed Artsakh Republic status of independence in the determined borders mostly based on current line of contact under ceasefire. The new recognized Republic of Artsakh will be recognized by Azerbaijan if the mentioned state will accept;

* Recognization of the crimes against humanity during the occupation of Karabakh by Armenian forces.
* International trial of officials and preparators of massacres like the famous Khojaly genocide.
* Demilitarize the borders of the new republic for 10 years (in planned deadline) limited to 1 brigade worth of soldiers limited in border defense and inner security (determined by a negotiation and monitored by UN). After the mentioned deadline restriction of the new states military size will be renegotiated but entry of any foreign military force will be restricted in peace time will be forbidden.
* Denying any claims rather than determined border of the new state.
* Having normalization of relations (after 5 years of implementation of the peace deal) with Azerbaijan including opening of consulates and borders.
* Will grant the loss right of Azerbaijani nationals by the occupation during 90s by settled conditions determined by international courts.
* That will have restriction of joining to any other state by their new constitution.

In these conditions we are will accept the independence of the mentioned entity (Alternatively we also could negotiate a deal of land exchange between Armenia and Azerbaijan with the current Armenian enclave in Karabakh for appropriate land in zengezur region of Armenia)

**2)** **Status of Lachin and Zengezur Corridors**

In the case of peace settlement we are willing to grant a legal status to Lachin corridor currently being held by peacekeeping force in return for a similar corridor granted to Azerbaijan in Zengezur region (by Aras river).

* Both proposed corridors are proposed to be 10 km in width.
* Lachin corridor will be granted to new proposed state of Artsakh and Zengezur corridor will be granted to Azerbaijan Republic.
* Respectively in both corridors by the negotiation’s transportation solutions will be determined to keep the roads open trough the corridors for both nations like bridges and tunnels. Also, the determined corridors will be open to air traffic to both nations.
* Azerbaijan is willing to provide financial support for relocation of villages in zengezur corridor to Armenian Propper.
* Roads, pipelines, rail roads, logistical facilities in the corridors will be owned legally by respective nations that will have right to protect them in case of open aggression for securing them.
* Passage will be free in both corridors by the respective nation’s acceptance (Azerbaijan in Zengezur, Artsakh in Lachin). But the terms for demilitarization of Artsakh will be implemented trough Lachin corridor meaning the military assets movement from Lachin will require permission of Azerbaijan.
* For 10 year the mentioned corridors will be monitored and the deals implementation will be observed by a committee and a small military force under UN authority. In this process common practices and regulations between Azerbaijan and Artsakh will be determined for ensuring cooperative usage of the mentioned corridors for the future.

3. Normalization of Relations between Azerbaijan-Armenia-Artsakh

Azerbaijan is willing to take actions for normalization of relation with both Armenia and Artsakh after 3 years of deals implementation (after acceptance between parliaments of the deal) including opening of diplomatic representations, start of border crossing and economic relations. We also think Turkey will normalize relations according to the pace of Azerbaijan. For steps of normalization we can set a calendar aiming for 5-10 year period.

Additional notes:

* After the implementation of the deal, we expect UN forces to over take the role in corridors by 6 months from current peacekeeping force.
* Turkey will be granted status of guarantor in the integrity of zengezur corridor and Armenia will be guarantor of the integrity of lachin corridor.
* We are interested in hearing of Armenian concerns to the proposed deal but the Armenian government should understand the concession offered for the stable peace between our nations by Azerbaijani side is close to limits of what is possible.",1
